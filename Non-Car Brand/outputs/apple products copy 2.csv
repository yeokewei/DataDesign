413,1493,5181,,,,,i feel like apple could remain in good graces with their core fans even while raising prices if they just focused on small value adds like including a fast charger in the box there is a large group of people that do not mind shelling out big bucks as long as they do not feel that they are being nickel and dimed at every turn as well ,4180,POSITIVE,related to apple products,Modern,,Trust,,

426,1518,5312,,,,,i do not understand why this makes you worried vp of environment lisa jackson had a spot at the last iphone event that explicitly made the point that apple is focus is on making their phones usable for a longer period of time this was also the launch of ios 12 which had a big focus on increasing the performance on old 5s 6 and 6s phones and it delivered on that promise i have been using an old 5s for the past few weeks and it is quite usable much more than it was last year people complained about new os is slowing down their phones for years and how they had to buy a new phone every 2 years to be able to run the current software apple is the only company delivering on these concerns if people buy a dollar1000 phone and have confidence that they or someone in their family can get 4 5 years of usable life out of it is that so much worse than buying a dollar650 phone and feeling like they need to upgrade in 2 years ,5,POSITIVE,related to apple products,Modern,,Trust,,
