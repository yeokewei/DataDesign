2,3,,,,,i have had my rolex explorer for around 3 months the explorer and explorer ii line had always been among my favorites i sold my 16550 a couple of years ago and always wanted an explorer to replace it like many the explorer is simple and borderline boring but it is a great watch it is been keeping time like a champ and has fit in all situations from more dressy to casual i really do like that it flies under the radar allows you to enjoy having a rolex without dealing with some of the silly connotations with well having a rolex the only problem is it has been such a great watch that it is hard to find another watch out there to compete with it i use to post more regularly on here but have been so satisfied with my explorer that i have stopped i still get the itch to sell it but it is only because i enjoy the experience of collecting so far i think this and my speedmaster have earned safe spots in my collection ,20,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Elegant,,Luxury,,
3,5,,,,,i service watches rolexes come across my bench frequently i do not personally own a rolex but if when i do this is the model i will be getting i am definitely not into watches for attention the explorer had a timeless look and still gets their solid movement what is not to love i even like it in all sorts of strap options ,6,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Elegant,,Luxury,,

62,115,wagoonladies,fuck yeah rolex datejust review just in time for new template, intro author expertise  i am now a watch expert i spent close to a week doing research on all this instead of learning ekgs so as long as you do not visit the hospital i am rotating at you will benefit from this adhd hyper fixation moment i also submitted the guide you are about to read thoroughly without skipping a single detail to r reptime and it was helpful enough to add to their wiki so yeah watch expert this guide also coincides perfectly with the new posting guidelines i happened to pick up a watch from ya girl nancy and i have a couple authentic versions laying around but when trying to write a review for this watch it was a lot harder than i anticipated for one watches are like complicated i can not even read one i never set mine and i just wear them cus they are cute but also the boys over at r reptime and r reptimeqc are even cunty er than us there is a lot more that goes into this than i thought and there also was not an eli5 version so i made it ideally you can read this prior to posting on r reptimeqc to help you understand you helpless weaker gender but in all seriousness they do not like it if you go over there and ask dumb questions just like we do not so if you want to learn more about rep watches take your time and learn how to read or do what i do and make your boyfriend read things to you while he rubs your feet below is a hard look at a rep watch and a guide explanation of the elements used on r reptimeqc that you must complete to have your watch looked over by some very very helpful enthusiasts this information is not directly anywhere it just tells you to use a set formatting amp x200b  disclosure  seller nancy nancy has finally offered me one item in exchange for a review i told her no thank you just continue to be my friend but seriously y all pick something out that you want a close up of and i will walk that bitch into the store idgaf however unless otherwise stated i continue to pay full price both emotionally and financially amp x200b  seller contact  whatsapp 1 323 515 0104 amp x200b  factory  honestly who fucking knows my boyfriend did a bunch of research for an ap last min i told him to order me a gold rolex impulsively again i had no idea the time and energy that repwatch people spend on this shit but do not do it this way use the td trusted dealers on r reptime for this and refer to this page for the best factory to request your watch from  you can use nancy for this if you want i think my boyfriend was able to put her in contact with gmf factory by connecting her with another seller he was talking to but again there is a much more expansive network that has already been vetted by some pretty hyped men  guide qc template used by r reptimeqc gt copy and paste this template and complete the details so that your watch can be qc would below are example answers change the example answers to your own  gt  gt dealer name jtime gt  gt factory name  gt  gt model name amp version number  15400 v2 with a3120 clone gt  gt price paid dollar508 gt  gt album links  gt  gt index alignment looks good is the 6

gt bezel brushed to perfection gt  gt solid end links sels  n a gt  gt timegrapher numbers looks good gt  gt anything else you notice the tapisserie is not the same as gen amp x200b  index alignment refers to the alignment of the hour markers or numerals on the watch dial the index alignment is essential for the overall aesthetics and functionality of the watch you can check the index alignment of your watch during the psp by having your seller send you a clear straight on shot of the face of the watch you will then take that image and upload it to this site there you can use the tools to look at the alignment and make sure it doesnt have a lazy eye now do not get your fing panties in a bunch if you find shit is misaligned i had a significan notly harder time doing this with my authentic than i did with my replica which i will explain below but the point is you need to make sure you understand where things are supposed to line up in the first place to use it also i had to take multiple photos in order to get a clear straight on shot of both watches for the tool to even do its stupid job unless you are buying from r reptime td trusted dealers your lady pushing 50 purses a day is not going to send qc quality watch shots  index alignment for a rolex lady is datejust 31 with diamond markers  accuracy accuracy refers to how close a measured value or information is to the true or correct value accuracy would be each spoke on the assessment tool hitting the middle of the diamond consistency consistency refers to the degree of uniformity stability or repeatability of results or measurements when performed under the same conditions in this case each spoke of the assessment tool touching the same points on the watch so in the next photo it is consistent but not accurate that was cus i was being lazy and did not hold the watch straight you want to make note of the consistency when using the tool if you have a photo like mine not the accuracy ideally both however  amp x200b  dial printing refers to the various markings text numerals and decorative elements to the watch dial the dial is the flat or slightly curved surface of the watch face where the time is displayed common elements you may find on a watch dial  hour markers minute markers brand name logo luminous material make the watch readable in low light conditions something that shit watches can fuck up if the chemical is not applied properly so your watch might look like shit even in the dark  dial printing for a rolex lady is datejust 31 with diamond markers this is somewhat straight forward and also really annoying and complex simply put just compare a close up of your rep with the authentic online ideally a photo of the authentic from a watch forum you will want to look at the following  diamond hour markers the dial will feature diamond hour markers at each hour position date window datejust models include a date window at the 3 o clock position allowing you to see the current date more on this in the date wheel alignment section rolex crown logo the rolex crown logo is present in place of the 12 o clock position  rolex brand name the brand name rolex is printed below the 12 o clock position and below that oyster perpetual datejust above the 6 o clock position will be superlative chronometer officially certified below the 6 o clock position will be swiss made with a rolex image between the words model collection name most rollies will have an engraving that is seen on the rim underneath the crystal face it will say rolexrolexrolexrolex until the 6 o clock position and then it will be the serial number you can see what i am talking about in the photo below  finally any rolex made after 2002 will have a very very faint etching on the crystal it is a small crown emblem etched at the 6 o clock position on the inside surface of the crystal it is really hard to see and i saw it first on my rep before i could find it on my auth note that an auth is not going to be all flashy about it its def super hard to find the rep on the other hand may or may not have it but if it does the fainter more difficult to spot the better read more about it  amp x200b this gets complicated because i cannot find the exact measurements of the above anywhere so if you want to get freakishly technical about it call your psychiatrist other than that just compare the two faces of the watch side by side as images try and look for the size and spacing of the letters if it is printed cleanly if it is spelled bolex same shit you would do with labels on our reps  fun fact kerning is a typographic term used in graphic design and typesetting to refer to the adjustment of the space between individual characters or letters in a piece of text it is specifically focused on adjusting the space between two adjacent characters to achieve better visual harmony and improve the overall appearance of the text  check yor kerrnningg  amp x200b  date wheel alignment printing also known as date disc alignment or date printing this is a rotating disc inside the watch movement that displays the current date through a small window date window on the watch dial date wheel alignment or printing refers to the proper positioning and centering of the numerical or numeral indicators on the date wheel to ensure that the date is correctly displayed in the date window watch manufacturers use different techniques and technologies to achieve accurate date wheel alignment during the manufacturing process misaligned date wheels can lead to various issues such as  partially hidden date if the date wheel is misaligned the date numerals may not fully appear through the date window making it difficult to read the complete date overlapping or misshapen numerals improper alignment can cause date numerals to overlap or appear distorted affecting readability incorrect date display in some cases a misaligned date wheel may cause the date to jump or change slightly before or after midnight leading to an inaccurate display  date wheel alignment printing for a rolex lady is datejust 31 in the case of rolex is the cyclops lens is the specific name for it is date window small circular piece of magnifying material typically made of sapphire crystal which is placed directly above the date aperture at the 3 o clock position on the watch dial the primary function of the cyclops is to enhance date legibility so you know if you are late and carrying your idiot boyfriends child it enlarges the date numeral by around 2 5 times making it more prominent and clearer for the wearer this is usually what is a dead give away as it is hard to reproduce further information also pretty straight forward and annoyingly technical off the bat i can tell that the number within the date wheel sits a little too low it is also slightly less visible and thus smaller than my auth this is due to the typeface being slightly smaller and something is a little off with the cyclops lens to assess this detail on your watch you are going to need someone who is trained to qc the watch to look at it or look at examples it is difficult because in photographs it is hard to determine if it is the right size there are things that someone can tell you to look for but fuck if i know the lettering has been 2 5x however in person and especially next to an authentic mine is obviously more difficult to read and shittier  amp x200b  hand alignment refers to the correct positioning and alignment of the watch hands hour minute and second hands on the watch dial  hand alignment for a rolex lady is datejust 31 basically the same as any watch and whats written above you are looking to see if your shit ticks right with the diamond index is this becomes a little irrelevant since there are not any markers to check the alignment i also do not care cus i am not looking at my watch for the time that would be ridiculous amp x200b  bezel a bezel is a functional and decorative component that surrounds the watch crystal glass face and holds it securely in place the bezel is typically located on the top of the watch case surrounding the face bezels can be made from various materials such as stainless steel gold ceramic precious stones depending on the watch type there are different types of bezels each serving unique purposes  protective bezel many watches have a protective bezel that covers and secures the watch crystal this bezel prevents the crystal from being scratched or damaged due to everyday wear and tear rotating bezel some sports and diving watches feature a rotating bezel usually with minute markings or a dive scale this bezel can be rotated unidirectionally to measure elapsed time or to keep track of remaining time during an activity tachymeter bezel certain chronograph watches have a tachymeter bezel this bezel is marked with a scale that allows the wearer to measure speed based on the time it takes to travel a known distance gmt bezel watches with gmt greenwich mean time or multiple time zone functions might have a bezel with 24 hour markings this bezel assists in tracking the time in different time zones which i know you guys are probably doing constantly  decorative bezel in luxury and fashion watches the bezel may serve a purely decorative purpose it can be adorned with precious stones diamonds or intricate designs to enhance the watch is aesthetics the only thing i care about  bezel for a rolex lady is datejust 31 a bezel for the datejust can be either fluted or smooth i personally think the smooth bezel is the ugliest thing i have ever seen but who i am to inform you that you are making a terrible choice there is also the iced out bezel i am indifferent however worth noting the fluted bezel only comes in solid gold the smooth bezel has various options for the metal type even if you get an authentic steel datejust 31 the fluted bezel will be in white gold i have not been able to find much information on determining the quality of your bezel you might have a bad bezel i asked r reptime about bad bezels no one has responded i have also trademarked bad bezel as my rapper name also not appreciated over at r reptime  amp x200b amp x200b  solid end links sels  refer to the solid metal links that connect the watch case to the watch bracelet or strap they are a feature commonly found in high quality and luxury watches the end links are located at the lugs of the watch case which are the protruding extensions on both sides of the case where the bracelet or strap attaches in watches with solid end links the metal links are precisely fitted to the specific shape and curvature of the watch case lugs this results in a seamless and precise connection between the case and the bracelet providing a comfortable and secure fit on the wrist solid is referring to the fit of the first link being tightly secured without gaps or movement not solid like good the way i initially interpreted it  solid end links sels for a rolex lady is datejust 31 this can be a little confusing so i will explain this in photos amp x200b image 1 is a stock photo which i have labeled to understand the components of the watch i will refer to the yellow are the two lungs which sit bilaterally and in between i have numbered the links of the jubilee band 1 2 amp 3 image 2 on the rep is a side shot where you can see link 1 is lifted and not flush with the lung you should not see this on an authentic watch this is the sel that is a fixed component and its a detail rolex and many other watch companies take great care in assuring the quality of so suck their dick image 3 in image three i have highlighted in yellow the lung of my authentic in yellow and labeled link 1 you can see in the picture link 1 is flush up against the lung while the rep is labeled 1st link has a very small lip to it i marked it in green but it might be hard to see amp x200b  timegrapher numbers also known as timegrapher readings or measurements are specific values obtained from a timegrapher which is a specialized watch testing instrument used by watchmakers and technicians to assess the accuracy and performance of the time on the watch i can not even read a watch so it is ironic for me to typing this up but here we go the timegrapher measures various aspects of a watch is movement and provides valuable information about its health and timekeeping capabilities some of the common timegrapher numbers include  rate in seconds per day the rate is the most crucial measurement and represents the watch is accuracy it indicates how many seconds the watch gains or loses over a 24 hour period a rate of 0 seconds per day means the watch is keeping perfect time while positive values indicate it is running fast and negative values mean it is running slow amplitude in degrees amplitude measures the arc through which the balance wheel swings it reflects the health of the watch is movement and its ability to maintain accurate timekeeping proper amplitude ensures that the balance wheel has enough energy to perform its oscillations effectively beat error in milliseconds beat error measures the consistency of the balance wheel is back and forth motion a low beat error value indicates good stability while higher values might suggest issues with the escapement beat rate in beats per hour beat rate represents the frequency at which the balance wheel oscillates for most mechanical watches the standard beat rate is 28 800 or 21 600 beats per hour lift angle in degrees lift angle is specific to watches with certain escapements e g lever escapement it measures the angle through which the escape wheel moves when releasing energy to the balance wheel beat number in beats per hour beat number indicates the number of vibrations beats the watch is balance wheel makes in one hour power reserve in hours in some advanced timegraphers the power reserve can be measured to determine how long the watch movement will run before needing to be wound again timegrapher readings provide insights into the condition of a watch movement helping watchmakers diagnose issues and regulate the watch for optimal accuracy if you go to a legit td they will take a picture of the timegrapher data so you know its gucci usually a rep can run 10 seconds off do not sweat it even auths need to be serviced to be maintained a rolex typically has a precision about  2 seconds values for the authentic rolex datejust 31 are below amplitude between 275 and 315 degrees   beat rate bph 28 800 bph lift angle 52 degrees precision 2 2 sec day  timegrapher numbers for a rolex lady is datejust 31 in addition to the above the movement of the watch is 3135 this is the most common rolex movement fitted into multiple sports watches it is a three hand with date function displaying hours minutes seconds and the date it is widely regarded as one of the wonders of horology boosting 31 jewels and a 50 hour power reserve the 3135 movement began in 1988 and has been fitted into the following watches oyster perpetual date datejust submariner sea dweller yacht master and the deep sea sea dweller you are not going to get that you can find something really close to that but it is literally like wanting your cc flap to be identical to auth go buy the real thing if you want the thing that makes the company renown amp x200b  additional information you can frankenstein your rep by getting auth face replacements band replacements or even re plating it you can resize your own buy a kit on amazon for 8 bucks do not do it drunk do not ask me how i know that i got a quote from a rep dealer for dollar8 200 for a solid gold date just but if you look on ebay you can find an authentic one vintage for the same price amp x200b amp x200b  discussion review my photos   psp factory photos n a authentic cost dollar300 shipping included amp x200b  timeline initiation of timeline is fuzzy cus my bf ordered this for me he placed an order for an ap watch with nancy pants and i asked him to causally throw in a gold rolex sometime around jul 1st 7 11 bf contacts like 50 other sellers for comparison making my life a living nightmare as if i know what a fucking 60k watch is supposed to look like also try to explain to him that he is either going to be robbed or people will know he has a small dick either way the watch is ridiculous 7 17 i fucked up and gave the wrong zip code cus i have been squatting in palm desert but do not live there full time correct tracking label 7 25 items arrive amp x200b  quality of your rep from your factory  off the bat it is lighter clearly a rep when held but specs are pretty on par with the authentic of course this is not a precise comparison and in the picture it looks like the rep has a slightly larger face but this is due to the color of the face of the watch when measured they have the same specs  over all the rep still has a solid weight to it the lowest quality element is the cyclops of the watch and the band the face is done quite well as you will read below but if you take it off and throw it at someone they will pick it up and will know they just got hit in the face with a rep the band feels flimsy thats the only way i can describe it i also thought the color was an extremely garish gold perfectly matching with my bv tote but a friend sent a photo of her auth for comparison and it is equally garish pics will be in accuracy however as long as you did not let some weird dude from r reptime eye fuck this watch the quality of this is pretty high additionally i might have pretended that both my watches were reps and posted them both to r reptimeqc my 8k silver datejust is very much real thank you very much regardless multiple people told me they both looked like garbage so bitches ai not shit but hoes and tricks in their defense men are stupid and the sub is grossly misogynistic on the other hand they were set up to fail but on the other other hand when pressed for more details of the lacking quality no one would tell me this is prior to reveling one was authentic then my post was deleted when i explained one was real  amp x200b  accuracy evaluated in two parts  part 1 your rep to the factory photo did not look at factory photos sent a photo and that was it sorryish part 2 the factory photo and your rep to auth index dial as mentioned above the index on this checks out as it is spaced evenly throughout the watch this was done well the minor mis alignment seen at i think it is 5 amp 6 o clock is from a slight angle while being held  dial printing pretty good there are examples that i have seen on r reptime that are actually bad but this passes the test and would only get a minor deduction  amp x200b   date wheel alignment this is pretty much the shittiest aspect of the watch as mentioned above the fonts a little small the time hits the bottom of the window and the cyclops magnification is a little wonky  hand alignment meh seems to be straight  bezel actually decent at this point it is not too hard to do however since reps have started to use the laser cutting machines look at other photos solid end links sels  also shit you want the links to sit flush within the lungs of the watch the lungs are the prongs that come off the face and where the band attaches there is a fixed link in the band that should be flush with the lungs photos to get an idea of what i mean  timegrapher numbers fuck if i know and fuck if i care it runs its been on time for the past two days and i do not know how to read a watch nor will i be wearing this for lengths of time so i will have to set it anyways  gold coloring yeah so they both are a ridiculous color amp x200b   rep satisfaction lol i am a fucking dumbass ladies datejust watches 26mm 28mm or 31mm cases are the only other models outside the day date collection to have the semi circular three link president bracelet from rolex only solid gold or platinum datejust watches are paired with president bracelets  did i investigate any of this prior to pointing to something and picking it out i am over here running my mouth to my boyfriend about his little dick and fragile ego meanwhile i am ordering a solid gold watch that is 31k so while the watch is president bracelet is correct for this style basically anyone who knows a little bit about rolexes is going to rob me that being said once i was able to confirm that the color gold was actually on par with the auth i felt more chill about getting kidnapped over it it would be so embarrassing to have be rescued wearing a bad rep this is by no means top top tier but just a fair warning women is rep watches tend to be lower quality in general there seems to be less of a demand and thus less effort extended but maybe also another reason to pick one up amp x200b  seller satisfaction ugh finally the star of the show so for anyone following the saga of nancy is and my lasting love affair it has officially been confirmed that it is too people who run the business it is nancy and her husband this update came from a few people including my boyfriend after getting a bizarre mix of service the husband erm definitely all over the place also appears to get drunk and rage at people was not aware of this until after my second post so far customers have come back to me with she was great about this aspect but wtf was up with this aspect and usually it is issues such as a price inconsistency i have not heard about anything more than dollar30 dollars being short all of a sudden 1000 of photos or drunken rage but nancy or the wife is quick to jump on it and make amends or find a solution her pros are that she looks for the best product has consistently found great shit ships fed ex really fast will refund or issue you credit if you do not like something her cons her husband is a psycho path they ship things really fast which for new buyers can feel very invasive and it seems like they are just starting to get use to the culture of us so it is a bit of a learning curve i love her i clearly think we are friends i am going to continue to order from her especially if i can write a review in exchange for a bag i like learning about this process seriously enjoy making a contribution to this sub and it looks like i have a seller who is willing to both make a contribution via their products and knowledge base but again this is not to incentivizes others to use her just keeping y all ethically informed about my best friend amp x200b  the wrap up would i let you guys wear this yeah for sure i think this is going to look mad cute in a little rep stack of shiny i would highly suggest however getting a two tone though not only is the all gold just hella pricey and dicey i actually think its a little much if you are going to be stacking with only gold jewelry basically if you wanna do all gold i suggest throwing in a rep diamond tennis bracelet or something to break up the stick of butter on your arm  too much amp x200b can i have a flair now ,328,fuck yeah rolex datejust review just in time for new template.  intro author expertise  i am now a watch expert i spent close to a week doing research on all this instead of learning ekgs so as long as you do not visit the hospital i am rotating at you will benefit from this adhd hyper fixation moment i also submitted the guide you are about to read thoroughly without skipping a single detail to r reptime and it was helpful enough to add to their wiki so yeah watch expert this guide also coincides perfectly with the new posting guidelines i happened to pick up a watch from ya girl nancy and i have a couple authentic versions laying around but when trying to write a review for this watch it was a lot harder than i anticipated for one watches are like complicated i can not even read one i never set mine and i just wear them cus they are cute but also the boys over at r reptime and r reptimeqc are even cunty er than us there is a lot more that goes into this than i thought and there also was not an eli5 version so i made it ideally you can read this prior to posting on r reptimeqc to help you understand you helpless weaker gender but in all seriousness they do not like it if you go over there and ask dumb questions just like we do not so if you want to learn more about rep watches take your time and learn how to read or do what i do and make your boyfriend read things to you while he rubs your feet below is a hard look at a rep watch and a guide explanation of the elements used on r reptimeqc that you must complete to have your watch looked over by some very very helpful enthusiasts this information is not directly anywhere it just tells you to use a set formatting amp x200b  disclosure  seller nancy nancy has finally offered me one item in exchange for a review i told her no thank you just continue to be my friend but seriously y all pick something out that you want a close up of and i will walk that bitch into the store idgaf however unless otherwise stated i continue to pay full price both emotionally and financially amp x200b  seller contact  whatsapp 1 323 515 0104 amp x200b  factory  honestly who fucking knows my boyfriend did a bunch of research for an ap last min i told him to order me a gold rolex impulsively again i had no idea the time and energy that repwatch people spend on this shit but do not do it this way use the td trusted dealers on r reptime for this and refer to this page for the best factory to request your watch from  you can use nancy for this if you want i think my boyfriend was able to put her in contact with gmf factory by connecting her with another seller he was talking to but again there is a much more expansive network that has already been vetted by some pretty hyped men  guide qc template used by r reptimeqc gt copy and paste this template and complete the details so that your watch can be qc would below are example

tapisserie is not the same as gen amp x200b  index alignment refers to the alignment of the hour markers or numerals on the watch dial the index alignment is essential for the overall aesthetics and functionality of the watch you can check the index alignment of your watch during the psp by having your seller send you a clear straight on shot of the face of the watch you will then take that image and upload it to this site there you can use the tools to look at the alignment and make sure it doesnt have a lazy eye now do not get your fing panties in a bunch if you find shit is misaligned i had a significan notly harder time doing this with my authentic than i did with my replica which i will explain below but the point is you need to make sure you understand where things are supposed to line up in the first place to use it also i had to take multiple photos in order to get a clear straight on shot of both watches for the tool to even do its stupid job unless you are buying from r reptime td trusted dealers your lady pushing 50 purses a day is not going to send qc quality watch shots  index alignment for a rolex lady is datejust 31 with diamond markers  accuracy accuracy refers to how close a measured value or information is to the true or correct value accuracy would be each spoke on the assessment tool hitting the middle of the diamond consistency consistency refers to the degree of uniformity stability or repeatability of results or measurements when performed under the same conditions in this case each spoke of the assessment tool touching the same points on the watch so in the next photo it is consistent but not accurate that was cus i was being lazy and did not hold the watch straight you want to make note of the consistency when using the tool if you have a photo like mine not the accuracy ideally both however  amp x200b  dial printing refers to the various markings text numerals and decorative elements to the watch dial the dial is the flat or slightly curved surface of the watch face where the time is displayed common elements you may find on a watch dial  hour markers minute markers brand name logo luminous material make the watch readable in low light conditions something that shit watches can fuck up if the chemical is not applied properly so your watch might look like shit even in the dark  dial printing for a rolex lady is datejust 31 with diamond markers this is somewhat straight forward and also really annoying and complex simply put just compare a close up of your rep with the authentic online ideally a photo of the authentic from a watch forum you will want to look at the following  diamond hour markers the dial will feature diamond hour markers at each hour position date window datejust models include a date window at the 3 o clock position allowing you to see the current date more on this in the date wheel alignment section rolex crown logo the rolex crown logo is present in place of the 12 o clock position  rolex brand name the brand name rolex is printed below the 12 o clock position and below that oyster perpetual datejust above the 6 o clock position will be superlative chronometer officially certified below the 6 o clock position will be swiss made with a rolex image between the words model collection name most rollies will have an engraving that is seen on the rim underneath the crystal face it will say rolexrolexrolexrolex until the 6 o clock position and then it will be the serial number you can see what i am talking about in the photo below  finally any rolex made after 2002 will have a very very faint etching on the crystal it is a small crown emblem etched at the 6 o clock position on the inside surface of the crystal it is really hard to see and i saw it first on my rep before i could find it on my auth note that an auth is not going to be all flashy about it its def super hard to find the rep on the other hand may or may not have it but if it does the fainter more difficult to spot the better read more about it  amp x200b this gets complicated because i cannot find the exact measurements of the above anywhere so if you want to get freakishly technical about it call your psychiatrist other than that just compare the two faces of the watch side by side as images try and look for the size and spacing of the letters if it is printed cleanly if it is spelled bolex same shit you would do with labels on our reps  fun fact kerning is a typographic term used in graphic design and typesetting to refer to the adjustment of the space between individual characters or letters in a piece of text it is specifically focused on adjusting the space between two adjacent characters to achieve better visual harmony and improve the overall appearance of the text  check yor kerrnningg  amp x200b  date wheel alignment printing also known as date disc alignment or date printing this is a rotating disc inside the watch movement that displays the current date through a small window date window on the watch dial date wheel alignment or printing refers to the proper positioning and centering of the numerical or numeral indicators on the date wheel to ensure that the date is correctly displayed in the date window watch manufacturers use different techniques and technologies to achieve accurate date wheel alignment during the manufacturing process misaligned date wheels can lead to various issues such as  partially hidden date if the date wheel is misaligned the date numerals may not fully appear through the date window making it difficult to read the complete date overlapping or misshapen numerals improper alignment can cause date numerals to overlap or appear distorted affecting readability incorrect date display in some cases a misaligned date wheel may cause the date to jump or change slightly before or after midnight leading to an inaccurate display  date wheel alignment printing for a rolex lady is datejust 31 in the case of rolex is the cyclops lens is the specific name for it is date window small circular piece of magnifying material typically made of sapphire crystal which is placed directly above the date aperture at the 3 o clock position on the watch dial the primary function of the cyclops is to enhance date legibility so you know if you are late and carrying your idiot boyfriends child it enlarges the date numeral by around 2 5 times making it more prominent and clearer for the wearer this is usually what is a dead give away as it is hard to reproduce further information also pretty straight forward and annoyingly technical off the bat i can tell that the number within the date wheel sits a little too low it is also slightly less visible and thus smaller than my auth this is due to the typeface being slightly smaller and something is a little off with the cyclops lens to assess this detail on your watch you are going to need someone who is trained to qc the watch to look at it or look at examples it is difficult because in photographs it is hard to determine if it is the right size there are things that someone can tell you to look for but fuck if i know the lettering has been 2 5x however in person and especially next to an authentic mine is obviously more difficult to read and shittier  amp x200b  hand alignment refers to the correct positioning and alignment of the watch hands hour minute and second hands on the watch dial  hand alignment for a rolex lady is datejust 31 basically the same as any watch and whats written above you are looking to see if your shit ticks right with the diamond index is this becomes a little irrelevant since there are not any markers to check the alignment i also do not care cus i am not looking at my watch for the time that would be ridiculous amp x200b  bezel a bezel is a functional and decorative component that surrounds the watch crystal glass face and holds it securely in place the bezel is typically located on the top of the watch case surrounding the face bezels can be made from various materials such as stainless steel gold ceramic precious stones depending on the watch type there are different types of bezels each serving unique purposes  protective bezel many watches have a protective bezel that covers and secures the watch crystal this bezel prevents the crystal from being scratched or damaged due to everyday wear and tear rotating bezel some sports and diving watches feature a rotating bezel usually with minute markings or a dive scale this bezel can be rotated unidirectionally to measure elapsed time or to keep track of remaining time during an activity tachymeter bezel certain chronograph watches have a tachymeter bezel this bezel is marked with a scale that allows the wearer to measure speed based on the time it takes to travel a known distance gmt bezel watches with gmt greenwich mean time or multiple time zone functions might have a bezel with 24 hour markings this bezel assists in tracking the time in different time zones which i know you guys are probably doing constantly  decorative bezel in luxury and fashion watches the bezel may serve a purely decorative purpose it can be adorned with precious stones diamonds or intricate designs to enhance the watch is aesthetics the only thing i care about  bezel for a rolex lady is datejust 31 a bezel for the datejust can be either fluted or smooth i personally think the smooth bezel is the ugliest thing i have ever seen but who i am to inform you that you are making a terrible choice there is also the iced out bezel i am indifferent however worth noting the fluted bezel only comes in solid gold the smooth bezel has various options for the metal type even if you get an authentic steel datejust 31 the fluted bezel will be in white gold i have not been able to find much information on determining the quality of your bezel you might have a bad bezel i asked r reptime about bad bezels no one has responded i have also trademarked bad bezel as my rapper name also not appreciated over at r reptime  amp x200b amp x200b  solid end links sels  refer to the solid metal links that connect the watch case to the watch bracelet or strap they are a feature commonly found in high quality and luxury watches the end links are located at the lugs of the watch case which are the protruding extensions on both sides of the case where the bracelet or strap attaches in watches with solid end links the metal links are precisely fitted to the specific shape and curvature of the watch case lugs this results in a seamless and precise connection between the case and the bracelet providing a comfortable and secure fit on the wrist solid is referring to the fit of the first link being tightly secured without gaps or movement not solid like good the way i initially interpreted it  solid end links sels for a rolex lady is datejust 31 this can be a little confusing so i will explain this in photos amp x200b image 1 is a stock photo which i have labeled to understand the components of the watch i will refer to the yellow are the two lungs which sit bilaterally and in between i have numbered the links of the jubilee band 1 2 amp 3 image 2 on the rep is a side shot where you can see link 1 is lifted and not flush with the lung you should not see this on an authentic watch this is the sel that is a fixed component and its a detail rolex and many other watch companies take great care in assuring the quality of so suck their dick image 3 in image three i have highlighted in yellow the lung of my authentic in yellow and labeled link 1 you can see in the picture link 1 is flush up against the lung while the rep is labeled 1st link has a very small lip to it i marked it in green but it might be hard to see amp x200b  timegrapher numbers also known as timegrapher readings or measurements are specific values obtained from a timegrapher which is a specialized watch testing instrument used by watchmakers and technicians to assess the accuracy and performance of the time on the watch i can not even read a watch so it is ironic for me to typing this up but here we go the timegrapher measures various aspects of a watch is movement and provides valuable information about its health and timekeeping capabilities some of the common timegrapher numbers include  rate in seconds per day the rate is the most crucial measurement and represents the watch is accuracy it indicates how many seconds the watch gains or loses over a 24 hour period a rate of 0 seconds per day means the watch is keeping perfect time while positive values indicate it is running fast and negative values mean it is running slow amplitude in degrees amplitude measures the arc through which the balance wheel swings it reflects the health of the watch is movement and its ability to maintain accurate timekeeping proper amplitude ensures that the balance wheel has enough energy to perform its oscillations effectively beat error in milliseconds beat error measures the consistency of the balance wheel is back and forth motion a low beat error value indicates good stability while higher values might suggest issues with the escapement beat rate in beats per hour beat rate represents the frequency at which the balance wheel oscillates for most mechanical watches the standard beat rate is 28 800 or 21 600 beats per hour lift angle in degrees lift angle is specific to watches with certain escapements e g lever escapement it measures the angle through which the escape wheel moves when releasing energy to the balance wheel beat number in beats per hour beat number indicates the number of vibrations beats the watch is balance wheel makes in one hour power reserve in hours in some advanced timegraphers the power reserve can be measured to determine how long the watch movement will run before needing to be wound again timegrapher readings provide insights into the condition of a watch movement helping watchmakers diagnose issues and regulate the watch for optimal accuracy if you go to a legit td they will take a picture of the timegrapher data so you know its gucci usually a rep can run 10 seconds off do not sweat it even auths need to be serviced to be maintained a rolex typically has a precision about  2 seconds values for the authentic rolex datejust 31 are below amplitude between 275 and 315 degrees   beat rate bph 28 800 bph lift angle 52 degrees precision 2 2 sec day  timegrapher numbers for a rolex lady is datejust 31 in addition to the above the movement of the watch is 3135 this is the most common rolex movement fitted into multiple sports watches it is a three hand with date function displaying hours minutes seconds and the date it is widely regarded as one of the wonders of horology boosting 31 jewels and a 50 hour power reserve the 3135 movement began in 1988 and has been fitted into the following watches oyster perpetual date datejust submariner sea dweller yacht master and the deep sea sea dweller you are not going to get that you can find something really close to that but it is literally like wanting your cc flap to be identical to auth go buy the real thing if you want the thing that makes the company renown amp x200b  additional information you can frankenstein your rep by getting auth face replacements band replacements or even re plating it you can resize your own buy a kit on amazon for 8 bucks do not do it drunk do not ask me how i know that i got a quote from a rep dealer for dollar8 200 for a solid gold date just but if you look on ebay you can find an authentic

cus my bf ordered this for me he placed an order for an ap watch with nancy pants and i asked him to causally throw in a gold rolex sometime around jul 1st 7 11 bf contacts like 50 other sellers for comparison making my life a living nightmare as if i know what a fucking 60k watch is supposed to look like also try to explain to him that he is either going to be robbed or people will know he has a small dick either way the watch is ridiculous 7 17 i fucked up and gave the wrong zip code cus i have been squatting in palm desert but do not live there full time correct tracking label 7 25 items arrive amp x200b  quality of your rep from your factory  off the bat it is lighter clearly a rep when held but specs are pretty on par with the authentic of course this is not a precise comparison and in the picture it looks like the rep has a slightly larger face but this is due to the color of the face of the watch when measured they have the same specs  over all the rep still has a solid weight to it the lowest quality element is the cyclops of the watch and the band the face is done quite well as you will read below but if you take it off and throw it at someone they will pick it up and will know they just got hit in the face with a rep the band feels flimsy thats the only way i can describe it i also thought the color was an extremely garish gold perfectly matching with my bv tote but a friend sent a photo of her auth for comparison and it is equally garish pics will be in accuracy however as long as you did not let some weird dude from r reptime eye fuck this watch the quality of this is pretty high additionally i might have pretended that both my watches were reps and posted them both to r reptimeqc my 8k silver datejust is very much real thank you very much regardless multiple people told me they both looked like garbage so bitches ai not shit but hoes and tricks in their defense men are stupid and the sub is grossly misogynistic on the other hand they were set up to fail but on the other other hand when pressed for more details of the lacking quality no one would tell me this is prior to reveling one was authentic then my post was deleted when i explained one was real  amp x200b  accuracy evaluated in two parts  part 1 your rep to the factory photo did not look at factory photos sent a photo and that was it sorryish part 2 the factory photo and your rep to auth index dial as mentioned above the index on this checks out as it is spaced evenly throughout the watch this was done well the minor mis alignment seen at i think it is 5 amp 6 o clock is from a slight angle while being held  dial printing pretty good there are examples that i have seen on r reptime that are actually bad but this passes the test and would only get a minor deduction  amp x200b   date wheel alignment this is pretty much the shittiest aspect of the watch as mentioned above the fonts a little small the time hits the bottom of the window and the cyclops magnification is a little wonky  hand alignment meh seems to be straight  bezel actually decent at this point it is not too hard to do however since reps have started to use the laser cutting machines look at other photos solid end links sels  also shit you want the links to sit flush within the lungs of the watch the lungs are the prongs that come off the face and where the band attaches there is a fixed link in the band that should be flush with the lungs photos to get an idea of what i mean  timegrapher numbers fuck if i know and fuck if i care it runs its been on time for the past two days and i do not know how to read a watch nor will i be wearing this for lengths of time so i will have to set it anyways  gold coloring yeah so they both are a ridiculous color amp x200b   rep satisfaction lol i am a

162,374,,,,,nice this precise model and configuration is my next purchase ,1,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Modern,,Success,,
163,375,,,,,love it i have the the fluted bezel variant 126234 but do love the look of the domed bezel jubilee bracelet is probably the most comfortable bracelet i have worn wear in good health ,1,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Elegant,,Passion,,
164,377,,,,,so beautiful i really want to get one to pass on to my daughter in the future ,1,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Elegant,,Family,,
167,385,,,,,thanks the polished part of the clasp ia already fairly scratched up tho ,6,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Elegant,,Balance,,
168,386,,,,,fluted or smooth looks good with a jubilee but imo if you are going oyster smooth is the better option fluted oyster just seems weird to me  fluted will hide scratches better but it also is flashier and reflects light all over like crazy so it is up to you to decide if that matches your preferences style in all white metal either looks fine but fluted will cost a bit more since the bezel is white gold for two tone fluted is miles ahead of smooth in looks imo it is all a matter of preference obviously but if you are the type of person who likes two tone fluted bezel plus jubilee is a classic datejust look ,5,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Elegant,,Style,,
169,390,,,,,thanks it is definitely on the smaller side i tried 36mm djs ops the op 39 as well as the dj 41 i could have easily pulled off each of them the 41 felt large ish which is not at all appropriate for a dj imo while the op 39 fit me perfectly the size difference makes the dj wear a bit more vintage and the op 39 wear more modern i like both but i prefer the vintage y look of smaller watches which is why i went with the dj 36 can not go wrong with either tho ,1,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Modern,,Balance,,
170,391,,,,,it does have a visible oyster clasp similar to vintage djs ,1,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Elegant,,Style,,
171,397,,,,,that and the fact that the  which is probably my favourite rolex ever only came in the domed bezel jubilee combination tbh the silver dial is gorgeous i might as well have gotten that one if i would not also have a santos with a silver dial and i did not want to create too much redundancy in the collection ,3,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Elegant,,Luxury,,
172,403,,,,,it possibly is gravity affecting the movement and or the oiling not being 100percent consistent should not be a big difference with those watches but a few seconds is okay a watch will nearly always run differently in each position because of gravity affecting it differently for example when horizontal the balance rests on the ruby and only has one point of slight friction and when vertical this is two because it rests on both ruby is very nifty and inventive to keep it running correct this way apologies for my wording btw english is not my first language so i sometimes have trouble trying to put into words what i am trying to explain ,2,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Stable,,Balance,,
173,405,,,,,i never really thought about it too much for me it is just normal to wear my watch on the right hand i would not know of any other watch but the tudor pelagos lhd for my taste work environment that is not a fitting daily driver plus i already have a blue omega smpc which i love to bits it is probably my favourite sports adventure watch for me personally it strikes the perfect balance between luxury functionality ,4,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Sporty,,Balance,,
174,407,,,,,oh gotcha thanks is the fluted really worth dollar1k i mean i understand it is white gold but dollar1k extra though why did you pick domed over fluted ,1,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Elegant,,Luxury,,
175,409,,,,,thanks for your respond i am looking to purchase a dj36 with jubilee bracelet however i have noticed that the smooth bezel is usually priced lower than the flute version but i guess the flute bezel hides scratches better op is dj bezel looks fine but i always find the flute bezel is something unique of rolex  i guess i just want to hear the pros and cons of both ,1,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Elegant,,Style,,
176,419,,,,,yeah two tone is definitely polarizing personally i really like the fluted bezel on my dj41 one fun thing i have noticed is that when i am driving and the sun hits it just right it reflects a kind of halo of light onto the roof of the car it is a cool little effect that catches my eye every now and then and makes me smile ,1,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Elegant,,Fun,,
177,426,,,,,will definitely do on both counts thanks for the advice ,2,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Dynamic,,Success,,
178,428,,,,,right on glad you have special moments with your dj41 mind if i ask where did you get it from and do you think it is worth getting a pre owned one thanks ,2,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Modern,,Luxury,,
179,429,,,,,thanks for the insight yeah i am planning to get a dj36 once i turn thirty as a mark of milestone still away to go as i am saving up the cash for one i just want to have something that is special to me  and thanks for sharing your cartier that piece looks really unique how do you like it compared to your rolex ,1,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Elegant,,Success,,
181,438,,,,,i wear it mostly on the black leather strap these days but it is an outstanding watch really outstanding in terms of what you get for the money easily on par with the rdj santos is around dollar1 5k cheaper  santos is the trendier watch it has been hyped in enthusiast circles for the past 2 years and i get many compliments on it from non watch people it also makes more of a statement than a non fluted rdj in my opinion funnily enough people do not perceive it as an expensive watch the same way they perceive a rolex which i see as a good thing  in terms of build quality it is really hard comparing them to each other both have 100m wr the santos offers better magnetic protection but the rolex has the easylink clasp the rolex has by far the better movement but the finishing on the santos is more intricate and finely executed than the rdj in this regard it shows that cartier is a jeweler with a ton of experience the santos also has the more interesting history first pilots watch and first mens wristwatch kind of hard to beat that looks wise i think i may slightly prefer the look of the rdj on the bracelet vs the santos however the santos comes with the amazing quick switch system which means i can change bracelets straps within 10s and no tools used giving me almost 2 watches in 1 and the santos looks  on a black alligator strap which allows me to use it as a proper dress watch ,1,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Elegant,,Style,,
182,439,,,,,this is interesting from what i gathered 904l steel has better corrosion resistance in specific circumstances which where no reasonable person would place his skin at but then i do not have proper education i believe 904l steel was picked because it feels heavier more solid and it polished well i do enjoy posts like these that calls out rolex is marketing instead of worshipping the brand as if it is the second coming of slice bread does 904l steel scratch easier in comparison with the regular stainless steel used by other brands the exact number escapes me ,2,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Stable,,Luxury,,
183,440,,,,,the datejust is not the entry level especially if you get the white gold fluted bezel depending on your style age the jubilee bracelet adds class but the oyster bracelet is modern do not worry you are not at the low end i find that most people recognize the rolex but could not tell the difference or care to between white gold and steel for the money tudor with in house movement is a fine timepiece ,1,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Elegant,,Luxury,,
184,443,,,,, positively spectacular that looks pretty fine i never that part of the history of cartier until now thanks for sharing would not surprise me if people praise the rolex higher than it given the robust marketing campaign of rolex at least it works and makes people like me wanting to purchase one ,1,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Elegant,,Excitement,,
185,446,,,,,i wanted to get a rolex datejust with the fluted bezel which comes in white gold i have always liked the jubilee bracelet better would something like this go well with casual clothes tho i have seen many people wear them with different things i usually wear maybe jeans with the adidas stan smiths and a polo or maybe just a hoodie i feel like it would go well but then again i am a noob i feel like golden is more classy,-1,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Elegant,,Style,,
186,447,,,,,i do not have much experience with online sales tbh i did recently buy from the watchbox and had a good experience and i think bob is watches is fairly popular for rolex but i am sure there are plenty of good options out there ,2,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Modern,,Trust,,

225,537,,,,,yes they are all slaved to the hour hand until they are set and then some of them are not anymore on some of these cheaper watches based on the 2813 which this one likely is the 24 hour hand can indeed be set by turning the crown counter to the date adjust rotation when the crown is pulled to the date set position we have had people on here who have had their watches for years without realizing that the gmt hand could be set it is not always the case of course but often enough that it is worth checking so yes looking at it it is indeed slaved to the 12 hour hand because that is how they come from the factory but if op gives it a twist he might be surprised ,1,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Dynamic,,Balance,,

248,572,,,,,w2c  seller orologio price dollar68 shipping 8 10 days i can not remember with this one description so i have put this one through the ringer so much so that i have outgrown it and it does not even fit my wrist anymore lol i have also lost the links so that is helpful but regardless this watch looks fantastic in person and if you can get past a few flaws which if you are buying in this price range you will have to then it is a pretty decent shitter mechanically the 2813 shitter movement is still chugging along and i have not had any problems there the rehaut looks thick but at least it is somewhat properly aligned with the crown but its a trade off because the etched rolex crown on the crystal is slightly misaligned as you can see from the pictures the bracelet on this is surprisingly not as bad as some that i have seen and the finish is decent for the most part aside from the scratches present from daily wear i personally really enjoy the look of a milgauss this is obviously a low tier version but there are many out there far worse for the price i have gotten my fill of it and have been able to enjoy it but since it is too small and i have lost the links i will be giving it away to a friend at this point the seller tossed in the rolex screwdriver to remove the links and did so for free upon request all in all it could be better but nothing is perfect at this price point i have never had a call out and people are more intrigued by it than anything its one of those low key rolex models that people do not see very often the lightning bolt looking orange seconds hand sweeping across the blue face really does something for it aesthetically debating getting the black one hope this helps somebody have a great sunday you guys cheers ,8,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Elegant,,Style,,

253,579,,,,,great post i think the milgauss are kinda an acquired taste they have definitely grown on me i like the version you have and the white face completely agree with you about a low key model so it flies under the radar a little guys can scrutinize subs and batmans and pepsis all day i have got a couple of watches for orologio in the cart already had another person say that that shop and jason007 pretty much have the same stuff but you can buy from orologuo for a little less money now trying to find good noob or clean sub with a little better movement than the 2813 without breaking the bank ,4,POSITIVE,related to rolex review,Dynamic,,Style,,
