54,262,,,,, u evilish i am laughing at the review in a good way just checking that you may not know most tomato and bbq sauces are vegan friendly if you are after more vegan friendly food to try i can recommend nearly any meat free chicken from coles herb and sons and the italian style plant based burgers from woolies also the woolies plant based mince is a great contender to the real thing even in consistency to me both are close enough to the real thing that i can not tell the difference at the very least i am glad there is more options coming up good on you for giving them a go ,1,POSITIVE,related to 7-eleven review,Friendly,,Excitement,,

63,281,,,,,the rebel whopper it is decent it is quite smokey and a little bit too soft and not chunky enough to be a meat burger but i really enjoy it i do not think i would ever mistake it for even reasonably okay meat but i think it is a really good way to dabble in meat replacements as a non vegan or a pretty good replacement if you are vegan veggo and forgotten the finer details of what meat tastes like ,6,POSITIVE,related to 7-eleven review,Dynamic,,Excitement,,

73,302,,,,,100percent i am not a vegetarian but i do not understand the desire to have vegetarian foods replicate meat it is perfectly fine for it to be it is own form of food i will extend that to things like vegan cheese and all the rest why what is the point if you want to have something that is cheese like but is not made from animal products why not do it embrace it and give it it is own identity instead of pretending it is normal if you are going to be vegan be proud of it not apologetic ,2,POSITIVE,related to 7-eleven review,Modern,,Freedom,,

85,371,,,,,i initially started coming to rantgrumps just so i could make minor complaints without getting bombed with do not like do not watch style nonsense i have never been very down on either of the grumps as people and honestly i do not even particularly think the show has gotten worse but with an genuinely open mind i decided to open up this thread and see if maybe i was missing something i mean if they are demonstrably horrible people then i guess i want to know about that well i am still unmoved every single item in the list is a complete stretch for all the word count in this post it all just adds up to a big pile of nothing zero plus zero plus zero is still zero no matter how many you string together look if you are looking for a hero to look up as an intellectual powerhouse or as a role model for how to live your life arin and danny are not that neither are 99percent of people they are funny and they are probably mostly nice people most of the items in this list more or less just amount to gasp arin and danny have personality flaws and are not perfect i will take them mostly in order but i will regroup them by theme  sr pelo drama god damn it ross badgegate arin flexing on twitter i am sorry the truth has upset you all of these are just arin is well intentioned but oversensitive absolutely none of this is any reason to think someone is a bad person arin seems like kind of a prickly person who sometimes takes things personally when he should not in every single one of these instances he actually has a point he just probably needed to chill out about it a little i actually totally see where he is coming from on the paper mario thing but clearly in context he should have known that the person who danny was talking about was just trying to be helpful the last one is just danny saying something stupid when he had his back against a wall the comment he was responding do was confrontational and he did not handle it very gracefully big deal he deleted it later which shows he at least has some awareness it was not very graceful and even if he had not deleted it whatever gimme a break here fake sjw persona game gyaru first of all when you say fake you just mean maybe arin has not thought this shit through and is reacting more emotionally and due to cultural pressure than because he is really mulled over all the issues here and come to his own conclusions but it is not like this is some machiavellian plan to convince the world he is woke like one day we are going to uncover leaked e mails where he is like can you believe these fools honestly believe i care about racism in mulan muahahahah  i find sjws annoying too but i am not about to call someone a bad person just because they are trying to be against racism and sexism and sometimes overthink things or have knee jerk reactions yeah like i said he does not seem like exactly an intellectual he would make a poor host of a philosophy podcast but he is not that he is a let is player and even if he did run a philosophy podcast this would still just make it a bad podcast it would not make him a bad person ghoul grumps 2018 i do not even what is the accusation here even arin does not want to do something and maybe he kinda made up excuses for not doing it when really he just did not wanna i mean okay or maybe they were not even excuses maybe he was just being honest because i do not see anything in that ten second clip of danny saying they would probably have time that contradicts that  soviet jump game dr cecil advertising this is the only thing here that i think approaches being an actual controversy but i still thought it was dumb as it was unfolding and still think it is mostly dumb now look people viral marketing is a thing when blair witch came out in the 90s they set up a fake website to pretend it was a true story are the blair witch creators all horrible people or can people just have fun with their marketing sometimes the emotional manipulation angle because people who had shitty families tried to relate to arin not liking his fictional uncle is a huge stretch there was no way arin could have predicted that reaction i agree that when people asked him directly if it was real or otherwise clearly revealed that they believed the story he should have at least responded to them and confirmed it was not real but i really just can not hate a person because they do something which is a very common way in the modern world to run a fun original marketing campaign  in the episode titled tricked into playing scary 90s fps game google autocompleted some search terms it goes by fast but it shows the history of porn websites the two that stand out are scared virgin gives up and a russian doujin where one of the tags is gang rape that is funny it is probably real and not a joke since it would be a little blue for a background gg joke worst case scenario someone at game grumps maybe arin is into some hardcore fetishes no big deal i looked up the scared virgin video by the way and in spite of the title it is a super inoffensive professionally filmed porn video of two people having vanilla consensual sex  at the time of writing this ubisoft has been under fire for several weeks for abuse sexism and racism that has resulted in the firing of several executives and the canadian ceo even stepped down more links one two three so ubisoft might not be something you want your name attached to at this current moment in time yesterday game grumps released a sponsored video for the new assassin is creed  yeah i can see why you used the hedging language might not be something you want your name attached to because this is a serious stretch  behind the scenes multiple people have bad stories about arin and this person believes them as they have seen the evidence arin is old friends feel like he is corrupt and that is his not the super kind person he says he is you can find someone out there who has not very nice things to say about anyone on the planet like i said above yeah arin seems a little hypersensitive and maybe a little childish i can imagine he is had fallings out with people over the years  secondhand smoke  arin is wrong about something what a piece of shit  smut grumps okay so he does not want suzy being drawn as porn or also likely maybe suzy did not want to be drawn that way and asked him to say something honestly i side more with him than with the author playing the victim by basically saying next time i will draw naked pictures of whoever i want whether they like it or not i support anyone is right to draw whatever they like but if it is porn of someone and the person asks you not to put it online it is at minimum the gentlemanly thing to do to comply  jonben t ramsey look you can not write a whole section on how arin is an asshole for being an sjw and then try to cancel someone for making an off color joke i was almost ready to be shocked by this until i looked it up and realized this case is from 1996 i thought it must have been something that was in the news when she made the instagram post look maybe it was in poor taste but i just can not give you this as a reason to hate someone come the fuck on  brent seems like kind of an asshole  jon is departure the community self labeled all this stuff conspiracy grumps for years for good reason and in the worst case what exactly is the problem here arin and jon had a falling out and kept quiet about it because it is their own private business  crikeydave dan harmon unless you have been living under a rock you have probably unknowingly collaborated with someone who is done terrible things at some point as for not taking the videos down honestly i am uncomfortable when channels do that and i do not know if i would do it myself an allegation is not proof what do we have a court system for if we as a society are going to instantly exile someone the moment anyone accuses them of anything if i ran a channel i would feel bad about immediately taking down a video like that without knowing for sure if the allegations were true and you say it took them 3 years to take it down as if every morning they woke up and re made the decision to not take them down they probably just put it on the not sure decide later pile initially and then forgot about it ,8,POSITIVE,related to 7-eleven
