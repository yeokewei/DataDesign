102,132,481,,,,,tldr snapdragon 8g3 is the first mobile soc based off armv9 2 64 bit only it still uses tsmc is n4p node like the 8 g1 and 8g2 besides using arm is brand new core architecture x4 a720 a520 it also now uses a 1 5 2 core configuration instead of the 8g2 is 1 4 3 or the more traditional 1 3 4 in the 8 g1 arm is new cortex x4 big core boasts some very decent improvements in st performance 20percent over the previous x3 in the likes of the snapdragon 8g2 however power consumption has also increased accordingly so st efficiency is not noticeably improved this is mostly fine considering the big core is generally leveraged to handle short and bursty workloads in order to make the phone feel snappy and fast still noticeably behind apple is a16 a17 pro in terms of st performance efficiency though the a720 medium core and a520 small core are mostly incremental upgrades both in terms of performance and efficiency over their predecessors a720 does get a pretty sweet efficiency improvement in floating point compute but nothing crazy the swapping of yet another small core for a medium core results in some very nice mt performance improvements now putting the snapdragon 8g3 pretty much ahead of the a17 pro is perf w in gb 5 and matching it in gb 6 qualcomm has officially catched up to apple in mt performance and efficiency it does remain slightly less efficient at lower power levels though apparently this chipset is capable of partially turning off its l3 cache and slc to save power but we still do not know much about how that would work and whether it requires software based scheduling or not the gpu is yet again a noticeable upgrade over the sd 8g2 and seems to mostly come from scaling up the compute like 8g2 did over 8 g1 8g2 was already on top of the competition when it came to gpu so this upgrade pretty much puts 8g3 in a class of its own when it comes to both performance and efficiency on the gpu side it completely overshadows every other smartphone chipset and even seems to match the performance a radeon 780m gtx 1050ti with an overclock overall 8g3 is a very solid upgrade over the 8g2 which was already a beast of an soc none of the performance or efficiency improvements are groundbreaking by any means but they are definitely great 8g3 vs 8g2 is a jump pretty much equivalent to 8g2 vs 8 g1 both in terms of cpu and gpu performance efficiency this really puts to shame google is tensor g3 which is barely a performance efficiency improvement over the notoriously bad tensor g2 samsung foundries at it again the amount of competition qualcomm is putting up with apple is really exciting to see ,65,POSITIVE,related to xiaomi review ,Dynamic,,Power,,

104,134,499,,,,,their little cores are fairly huge and still significan notly lead on perf watt compared to everyone else and at much higher performance this remains a key advantage for them if you profile what it is doing even intense things like games try to keep mostly on the little cores and send things to the big cores in blips so this saves on soc power ,21,POSITIVE,related to xiaomi review ,Powerful,,Power,,

221,263,1288,xiaomi,xiaomi 13t unprofessional review,hello so i recently upgraded to 13t from mi10t and i have been using it for about a week now and here are the things that i experienced first off i think this is not a big deal to anyone but it is indeed refreshing to have amoled instead of ips lcd the display is spectacular i have low expectations lol but the colors are so vibrant and i love it second the refresh rate recommends me using the default one which is the adaptive refresh rate where it changes depending on how you are using the device which i think is battery consuming on default the phone is displaying up to 144hz something but there is the custom option where you can choose to have either 60hz or 144hz which sucks so i stuck with default the dynamic one third battery life i was actually alarmed at first when i literally used it after getting it out of the box on how fast the battery drains though i had not optimized it yet but dang those fancy things drain the battery so much the always on display which is cool but unfortunately eats up the battery the refresh rate dynamic one and it is extreme brightness under auto brightness i do not want to disable anything because i have this thought that i upgraded to this one because of these features so turning them off would be useless that is on me  fourth it is smooth as for most part i have the 12 256 variant with expandable ram i forgot how much i did not expand it because i have not tried doing much tasks at once so it is a win for me fifth dolby atmos i like listening to music or streaming and dolby atmos changed the game the sounds became clear like you can each instrument being used in a music lastly idk if it is a me problem a phone problem or a wifi problem but a few hours ago was the first i experienced that weird thing where my phone randomly disconnects from the wifi i was not pressing anything nor turning off my wifi on my phone it just randomly happens is it a phone problem also it is still on miui global 14 0 5 and android 13 edit forgot to add the camera not a big camera enthusiast but i am a big fan of amazing photos the quality is crisp and amazing video can capture 4k with 30

261,313,1531,xiaomi,xiaomi 11t pro personal review after 10 months a great phone held off by poor optimization,i used to own a redmi note 8 pro it was a great phone but after 3 years i started to feel the need for a worthy upgrade with a budget of 400 euros i conducted some research and stumbled upon the xiaomi 11t pro it had everything i needed a powerful cpu a smooth and bright amoled screen with nice features such as hdr 10 support a big battery with super fast charging a competent camera system and an overall fantastic specsheet no other phone offered more at that price at the time of my research i have used it for 10 months and i feel like i wanted to share my experience with you  design  the overall aestetichs are a bit generic since it is very similar to many other xiaomi models but personally i find it quite elegant build quality is really solid both the screen and the back are covered in gorilla glass victus which gives it some really good protection the side rails are made in sturdy feeling alluminum with a grippy matte surface i am not sure if that means it is anodyzed and the top side of the phone features a flat glass surface which houses the top speaker and an ir

light to make full advantage of all the pixels and in some situations you might get noise videos on the main sensor are really good and it can record up to 8k ai but it is completely unstabilized so i usually go with 4k which gives you eis but i still really wish it had ois it can also record in hdr10 and i have tested it it appears like it makes colors a bit less vibrant than the default mode and goes for a more cinematic look which is nice for some uses but it certainly is a niche feature since recording in this mode might give you some compatibility issues if you are trying to share your video on social media platforms the 8mp uw is also pretty good it does not feel like a downgrade when switching from the main sensor and the images it takes are still pretty crisp it performs decently in low light when using night mode but it is not great in more challenging conditions for example when the sun is in the background it can only record in 1080p the 5mp macro really impressed me this is possibly one of the very few phones to have an actually good macro camera it can focus from really up close and altough 5mp is not a high resolution details are much better than all the other 2mp macro cameras found in many other phones i was impressed by the results you can get with some editing as mentioned before resolution is not very high and you will only get good results in daylight but this is a step above many phones here is a post i have made with some macro footage  the selfie camera is just average and that is true for the majority of xiaomi is models  speakers the dual speaker

personal review interesting and feel free to ask any question ,34,xiaomi 11t pro personal review after 10 months a great phone held off by poor optimization. i used to own a redmi note 8 pro it was a great phone but after 3 years i started to feel the need for a worthy upgrade with a budget of 400 euros i conducted some research and stumbled upon the xiaomi 11t pro it had everything i needed a powerful cpu a smooth and bright amoled screen with nice features such as hdr 10 support a big battery with super fast charging a competent camera system and an overall fantastic specsheet no other phone offered more at that price at the time of my research i have used it for 10 months and i feel like i wanted to share my experience with you  design  the overall aestetichs are a bit generic since it is very similar to many other xiaomi models but personally i find it quite elegant build quality is really solid both the screen and the back are covered in gorilla glass victus which gives it some really good protection the side rails are made in sturdy feeling alluminum with a grippy matte surface i am not sure if that means it is anodyzed and the top side of the phone features a flat glass surface which houses the top speaker and an ir blaster along with a harman kardon label etched under the glass which i find to be quite a cool detail the back panel houses the three cameras and the bump is quite evident the glass on the back has a brushed alluminum look it attracts a lot of fingerprints and it is slippery unfortunately there is only a ip53 rating but i think there is still a
