ACURA MDX,"Reaching the 4th generation, the MDX became the Acura’s flagship model. The most stylish and performance-oriented SUV in their history, the MDX was built on a completely new platform. The exterior design suffered lots of changes over the years and seems that Acura learned exactly what to do to turn heads. With a bold and aggressive look, the MDX a low wide stance and the radical design transformation included a longer hood and a sleek cabin. New LED highlits, daytime running lights and LED stoplights were part of the new package, as well as tiny foglamps. The diamond-shaped grille emphasized the sporty-luxurious nature of the MDX. For the new MDX, Acura improved the steering with the introduction of the EPS (Electric Power Steering) for increased steering assist. The system offered a precise, smooth and almost instantaneous steering response. Extremely versatile, the MDX offered seating for 7 under different captain chair/bench configuration. The third row was improved with additional headroom and legroom, while with the new sunroof, the 3rd row offered a light and spacious feeling. The traditional cluster gauges were replaced by a 12.3-inch driver’s meter. The new MDX featured the Acura Precision Cockpit, meaning that the MDX went all-digital removing the traditional gauges. A new engine was introduced with the MDX, a 3.5-liter V6 powerplant that developed 290 hp.  The unit was paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission, with a smooth gearbox that offered a wider gear ratio change.",ACURA,"{  ""car-model"": ""Acura MDX"", ""year"": ""4th generation"", ""size"": ""low, wide stance"", ""overall-design"": [""bold"", ""aggressive"", ""stylish"", ""performance-oriented"", ""radical""], ""design-elements"": { ""windshield"": [""sleek cabin""], ""grille"": [""diamond-shaped"", ""sporty-luxurious""], ""hood"": [""longer""], ""headlights"": [""New LED highlits""], ""bumper"": [""tiny foglamps""], ""wheel"": [], ""doors"": [], ""roof"": [""new sunroof""], ""diffusor"": [], ""spoiler"": [], ""exhaust"": [] } }"
ACURA RDX,"Acura introduced a facelift for the third generation of the RDX in 2021 as a model 2022, and it made it more dynamic than before. After more than half a million units sold between 2006 and 2021, the carmaker decided to give the RDX a bump to boost its sales, even though it was only two-year-old. While some changes added visual updates, there were others that improved the car’s handling. The RDX was the most agile SUV in the carmaker’s stable, and it tried to match its performance with an adequate design. Its pentagonal grille featured thinner chromed surroundings and an option for LED fog lights. The car featured round exhausts at the back for the A-Spec model, while the rest of the range received rectangular ones. The carmaker installed 19,” or 20” light-alloy wheels with five, ten, or 15 spoke design. For the interior, the most important changes were barely visible, but they included additional paddings on the ceiling, dashboard, and firewall. Thus, the cabin was quieter than before, adding more comfort for passengers’ ears. The rear doors also received sound-deadening materials and acoustic glass. Under the hood, the carmaker opted for the same 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, but with a cold-idle speed lowered at 950 rpm instead of 1,100 rpm as before. In addition, a retuned adaptive suspension system included a four-setting switch that allowed the car better handling depending on the driver’s needs and road conditions.",ACURA,"{  ""car-model"": ""RDX"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""dynamic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""pentagonal"", ""thinner"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""19-inch"", ""20-inch"", ""light-alloy"", ""five-spoke"", ""ten-spoke"", ""15-spoke""],    ""doors"": [""rear""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""round"", ""rectangular""]  }}"
ACURA TLX,"No more drama and no more facelifted version for the Acura TLX since the Japanese premium car-maker brought a new sport-sedan in 2020. Acura introduced the first generation of the TLX was in 2014, and it was based on the same platform as the Honda Accord. The design elements were completely different, but they used the same engines. The second generation started from a blank sheet of paper, with a new platform, The Acura TLX featured an angular design, with headlights that mimicked an angry samurai's eyes. With a pentagonal shaped grille and other air-intakes in the apron, the TLX looked aggressive. Sharp lines were designed on the sides and on the rear panel. The 2021 model was wider and longer than its predecessor. The headlights and taillights featured LED lamps. Inside, due to its longer wheelbase by 3.7"" (94 mm), the TLX offered more legroom for the rear passengers. The middle seat was cramped due to the big center tunnel since it was available with an all-wheel-drive system as well. Acura fitted the front seats with up to 16-way adjustments to increase the front occupant's comfort. A new infotainment unit was developed, and it was Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatible. For the drivetrain, the TLX was offered in various trim level. 2021 marked the return of the Type S version, which featured all-wheel-drive and adaptive damper settings. There were four engines available, and all of them were mated to automatic transmissions with 8, 9, or ten gears, depending on the engine.",ACURA,"{  ""car-model"": ""Acura TLX"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""wider and longer"",  ""overall-design"": [""angular"", ""aggressive"", ""sharp lines""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""pentagonal shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""mimicked angry samurai's eyes"", ""LED lamps""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
ACURA ILX,"The facelifted version of the ILX brought a sportier vibe with its new grille, taillights and a lower diffuser with an exposed exhaust. The wheels design was also upgraded, sporting 17-inch alloys or the 18-inch wheels available with the A-spec trim level. The exterior color palette got refreshed and 5 new colors were added: Platinum White Pearl, Majestic Black Pearl, Performance Red Pearl, Canyon Bronze Metallic1 and A-Spec-exclusive Apex Blue Pearl. New colors for the interior were also added and for the A-Spec, the standard colors were Ebony and Red. The ILX was powered by a 2.4-liter engine with 201 hp and 180 lb-ft of torque. The engine was mated to the only available transmission, an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic. The ILX was available with 7 different packages and lots of new features. The standard ILX sported 17-inch wheels, a sunroof, keyless entry, automatic LED lights, automatic climate control, heated front seats, heated side mirrors, Bluetooth connection with media streaming, a rear-view camera, active sound cancellation, etc. The Acura Watch package included more safety features such as lane-keep assist, lane-departure warning and collision mitigation braking. The Premium package added a more performant sound system, leather upholstery, a blind spot monitoring system and a 7-inch touchscreen. The Technology Plus featured a bigger touchscreen and a 10-speaker ELS audio system. The top range was the A-Spec trim level that could only be added to the Premium or the Technology Plus packages and sported 18-inch alloys along with sport seats, fog lights, a rear spoiler and aluminum sport pedals. Safety-wise, the car received a 5-star rating from the NHTSA at the crash testing.",ACURA,"{  ""car-model"": ""ILX"",  ""year"": ""facelifted version"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""sportier"", ""refreshed"", ""upgraded""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""new""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""automatic LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""17-inch"", ""18-inch""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""lower""],    ""spoiler"": [""rear""],    ""exhaust"": [""exposed""]  }}"
ACURA RLX,"In 2017, Acura introduced the facelifted version of the RLX on the North American market, improving the Japanese automaker's flagship. The RLX took the flagship from the previous RL and Legend lineups left. The Legend was a very appreciated vehicle worldwide, whether it sported the Honda or the Acura badge. Moreover, the RLX was sold as Honda Legend in Japan. Meanwhile, technology evolved, and the Japanese carmaker improved its skills in creating hybrid sports vehicles, such as the NSX. As a result, some of the ideas met on the 2018 model-year RLX were carried over from that car. Up front, the RLX sported the new design language made by Acura and seen on the MDX model. Its grille featured a 3D pattern with lines and dots that converged to the center towards the Acura chromed badge. A chromed trim surrounded it, and, in addition, more chromed elements were added to the lower bumper around the side scoops. The diamond-inspired look of the headlights featured LED lamps with adaptive lighting. From its profile, the RLX looked more like a sports sedan than a regular, mid-size one. In addition, the carmaker added a few more chromed trims at the back around the side exhausts and on the trunk's lid. Inside, the carmaker listened to the critics who said that the interior was not as luxurious or didn't provide such a premium feel as some of its competitors. Thus, Acura introduced a higher quality leather upholstery, new wood trims, and seats. Under the hood, Acura offered a choice of two drivetrains. The base version featured a 3.5-liter V6 that sent the power to the front wheels via a ten-speed automatic. At the same time, the top model received a 377 hp (382 PS) hybrid powerplant that sent its torque in all corners via a seven-speed automatic.",ACURA,"{  ""car-model"": ""RLX"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""facelifted"", ""improved"", ""flagship"", ""sports sedan""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""3D pattern"", ""lines"", ""dots"", ""chromed trim""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""diamond-inspired"", ""LED lamps"", ""adaptive lighting""],    ""bumper"": [""lower bumper"", ""side scoops""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""side exhausts""]  }}"
ACURA ZDX,"Acura made a surprising move in 2023 when it introduced the ZDX as its first full-electric SUV. Usually, automakers started with sedans and evolved later with SUVs. But the Japanese premium brand took a different approach and made the ZDX its forerunner in the electric car revolution. Honda made its first full-electric vehicle, the E, in 2020. It was not a huge success, but the automaker learned what customers want from an electron-powered vehicle. So, three years later, it brought another EV. Only this time, it was not sold under Honda's badge but on Acura's logo. Moreover, creating an entirely new platform specifically designed for EVs paved the way for other such vehicles built and sold by both brands. Acura introduced the Precision EV Concept at the 2022 Monterey Car Week, and many people thought that it was just another show car with no real future. Yet, Acura proved them wrong, and one year later, it unveiled the production version of that SUV under the ZDX nameplate. Acura's design studio from California designed the vehicle and carefully incorporated the brand's specific details onto the car. As a result, the front fascia featured the same pentagonal-shaped grille, although it was mostly blocked since electric vehicles didn't need wide cooling areas. That was flanked by LED headlights with a shape that resembled the ones from other Acura products, such as the Integra Type S. On the outer sides of the lower front bumper, the design team created scoops that created a sporty image for the SUV. Several silver trims adorned the front fascia and continued on the sides, on the vehicle's skirts. The greenhouse looked different than other Acura products since it featured a free-floating design emphasized by the chromed trim that surrounded the upper side of the windows' area and was sloped down on the C-pillars. Since Acura was mostly a premium yet sporty brand, the designers penned a raked-forward tailgate adorned by a roof spoiler at the back. The car's interior was up to Acura's standards, boasting a high level of technology, refinement, and comfort. In front of the driver, the automaker installed an 11"" digital instrument cluster, while atop the center stack mounted an additional 11.3"" touchscreen for the infotainment system. The car had integrated Google Maps, and it could display it on either screen. Moreover, it could suggest routes based on the charging stations available on the routes and even precondition the battery pack to speed up charging sessions. Since the vehicle was so silent, the automaker considered installing an 18-speaker Bang&Olufsen audio system that provided a surround sound experience. The front bucket seats offered enough side bolstering and were separated by a tall center console, which hosted two storage areas and a pair of cup holders. Acura offered the ZDX with two available powertrains: a two-wheel-drive version with one motor for the rear axle and an all-wheel-drive one with motors on both ends of the SUV. The former was estimated to cover 325 miles (523 km) on a single charge.",ACURA,"{  ""car-model"": ""ZDX"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""sporty"", ""electric""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""pentagonal-shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""resembling Integra Type S""],    ""bumper"": [""sporty""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""raked-forward"", ""with spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
ACURA NSX,"The Japanese automaker didn't want to rush things before introducing a new generation for the beloved NSX nameplate, but when it did, it was, again, a revolutionary vehicle. Unlike its famous predecessor, the 2016 NSX was not designed and conceived as a supercar-beater but more of a GT with a sportscar appearance. Depending on the market, Honda sold it under the Acura or the Honda badge, even though the main difference between them was the speedometer marked in kilometers per hour or miles per hour, respectively. But, since both versions sported a digital display, it was just a matter of software setting. Like its predecessor, the 2016 NSX was a mid-engined car with a short nose. The styling, on the other hand, was completely different. Its angular front fascia sported slim LED headlights and a pentagonal-shaped grille flanked by broad side scoops. From its profile, the greenhouse sported an arched roofline that sloped down to the back of the vehicle, covering the engine compartment. In front of the rear wheel arches, the automaker installed the air intakes needed to cool the engine and feed it with air. Finally, at the back, Honda's design team installed LED taillights linked with a red strip. Despite the sporty exterior look, the cabin was luxurious. Even though it featured high-bolstered seats, these provided both comfort and side support. Between the car's occupants, the automaker installed a tall center console that hosted the buttons for the gearbox. There wasn't any shift lever or gear selector. Fronting the driver was a TFT that showed the speedometer in digits inside the round tachometer. But the real magic of the car happened under its skin, where a pair of electric motors drove the front wheels while a third motor helped the turbocharged V6 placed behind the cabin. Thus, the NSX proved to be not just fast but also fuel efficient.",ACURA,"{  ""car-model"": ""NSX"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""mid-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""revolutionary"", ""sportscar appearance"", ""angular front fascia"", ""arched roofline"", ""luxurious cabin""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""angular""],    ""grille"": [""pentagonal-shaped""],    ""hood"": [""short""],    ""headlights"": [""slim"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""arched""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
ACURA Integra Sedan,"The Integra Type S was already a well-known nameplate in the car-enthusiasts community, especially among Honda and Acura aficionados, and was revived in the mid-Spring of 2023. Honda has used the Integra moniker on its own-badged products since 1985 on the Quint Integra model that was sold in Japan and later in the U.S. and Europe. But starting with the fourth generation, this nameplate was canceled from Acura's lineup, being replaced by the RSX. Come 2022, the premium Japanese brand brought it back and, in 2023, unveiled the Type S version that targeted the young generation. It was a sporty vehicle that could also provide enough comfort and space to be considered a family car. Even though it wasn't the first four-door Integra, its sports-oriented designation was more obvious on the Type S version. The front fascia kept the angular styling from the rest of the Integra lineup but with a different bumper. That featured larger side scoops that flanked the apron fitted with a broad grille and a lip spoiler at the bottom. In addition, the main pentagonal grille was adorned with the Type S logo. Moreover, the hood was fitted with a vent. Finally, the automaker installed the three-exhaust system at the back, centrally mounted, like in the Civic Type R with which the Integra Type S shared its platform. Inside, the automaker installed a similar-looking cabin as in the rest of the Integra, bar the six-speed manual that replaced the selector for the CVT. Moreover, the front seats' headrests were adorned with the TypeS badge embroidered. But the most significant upgrade was on the drivetrain, which received the K20C turbocharged inline-four as the Civic Type R. It sent its power to the front wheels via a limited-slip differential. Unlike the Type R, which focused on performance, the Type S was designed mostly for street use, hence the adaptive suspension that allowed for a more comfortable ride than its Honda-labeled sibling.",ACURA,"{  ""car-model"": ""Integra Type S"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""four-door"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""angular"", ""premium"", ""youthful"", ""family-friendly""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""pentagonal""],    ""hood"": [""vented""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""angular"", ""with side scoops""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""lip""],    ""exhaust"": [""three-exhaust system""]  }}"
ALFA ROMEO Giulia,"Alfa Romeo took the sports compact premium sedans by storm in 2015 when it introduced the Giulia, a car that took competitors by surprise and even made it across the ocean to the U.S. shores. After failing to satisfy American customers back in the 90s, Alfa Romeo had to take a step back and focus on its European products. But when the new generation of the Giulia came on the market, it was time to cross the Atlantic ocean and roll its wheels onto American soil in 2015. But fast forward another seven years, and the Giulia received a new upgrade. At the front, the ""Trilobo"" grille received a refresh, and the center triangle got a slimmer chromed trim. Also, it was shorter than the previous one, while the lower lobes were wider. Furthermore, the LED headlights sported angular-looking LED daytime running lights. At the back, the full LED taillights looked similar in shape but with a sharper lighting pattern. Last but not least, the Italian automaker included new light alloy wheels on the options list. Inside, the most striking update was seen inside the instrument cluster, where a 12.3"" TFT screen accessed all the vehicle information and parameters. In addition, the carmaker offered customization with three different layouts. Another unusual feature of the Giulia was the introduction of an NFT technology that could be included in the vehicle. This feature could keep track of vehicle's data and store it online using blockchain technology. Under the skin, Alfa Romeo introduced a new 160 PS turbo-diesel version as a rear-wheel drive only affair, complementing the 210 PS turbo-diesel and the 280 PS turbocharged gasoline engine lineup.",ALFA ROMEO,"{  ""car-model"": ""Giulia"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""sports compact premium sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed front grille"", ""angular LED headlights"", ""slimmer chromed trim"", ""wider lower lobes"", ""sharp LED taillights"", ""new light alloy wheels"", ""12.3\"" TFT instrument cluster"", ""customizable layouts"", ""NFT technology for data tracking""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""refreshed"", ""slimmer"", ""wider""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angular"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""new light alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
ALFA ROMEO Stelvio,"Sharing its platform with the Alfa Romeo Giulia, the Stelvio also received an update for 2022 and got an update on the design and the drivetrain. The Italian automaker introduced the Stelvio crossover in 2017. The name comes from a famous Italian mountain pass where the winding road took the drivers across the mountain. And it's pretty spectacular! Maybe less spectacular was the upgraded version, which was noticeable but not that obvious. At the front, the vehicle received an improved front fascia that revealed a change in the ""Trilobo"" grille. That's how the Italians named the vertical triangle, pointed down, and the lower side scoops. In addition, there was a slimmer chromed trim on the triangle than on its predecessor, while the side air intakes were wider. Also, the headlights went through a change with the three LED daytime running lights that resembled the 1989 Alfa Romeo SZ Zagato. However, the profile had little to no differences, apart from new optional light-alloy wheels compared to its predecessor. At the back, the taillights got a sharper LED pattern. Inside, everything resembled a Giulia, from the steering wheel with a push-button to start the engine to the gear selector for the automatic transmission. Yet, the dashboard was different but, like the Giulia, featured a 12.3"" TFT screen for the instrument panel with three different layouts: Evolved, Relax, and Heritage. The high-bolstered front seats were unusual for a crossover, but they fitted the Stelvio very well. Underneath the hood, Alfa Romeo introduced a new 160 PS (158 HP) turbo-diesel that sent its power to the rear wheels only, while the other two versions of 280 PS (276 HP) and the 210 PS (207 HP) powerplants sent their oomph in all corners. The most potent version was a turbocharged gasoline unit, while the other was a turbo-diesel.",ALFA ROMEO,"{  ""car-model"": ""Stelvio"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""updated"", ""improved"", ""spectacular"", ""slimmer"", ""sharper""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""Trilobo"", ""vertical triangle"", ""pointed down"", ""lower side scoops""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED daytime running lights"", ""resembling 1989 Alfa Romeo SZ Zagato""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""new optional light-alloy wheels""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
ALFA ROMEO Giulietta,"After six years on the market, the Giulietta was refreshed in 2016. It took some design cues from its bigger sibling Giulia and introduced new engines to match the refreshed look. The Giulietta name wasn't new in the Alfa Romeo family. The first model that with that name was released in 1954 and it was offered as a family sedan, a coupe, and a roadster. In 1977, the Giulietta name was revealed again on a small executive four-door vehicle and it was produced until 1985. The third time when Alfa Romeo used the name was in 2010, with the launch of the 5-door hatchback. This time, with a front-wheel-drive. The facelift adopted some styling cues from the Giulietta, which was the Alfa Romeo paradigm. It was enhanced and took a few exterior style elements, such as the honeycomb grille, the front bumper, and a refreshed logo. The darkened headlights amplified the sporty look of the car. Inside, the Giulietta's design wasn't as attractive as the exterior. It featured the same look for the dashboard and the instrument cluster looked good. A new Uconnect infotainment unit was fitted with a 5” or 5.6” touchscreen in the middle of the dashboard. It featured internet and Bluetooth connectivity. A live navigation system was available as an option. For the engine bay, the 2016 Giulietta received a new 1.6 jTDM diesel engine mated to a TCT (dual-clutch) gearbox. For the entire range, Giulietta was fitted as standard with a 6-speed manual and only some of the engines were available with the automated transmission.",ALFA ROMEO,"{  ""car-model"": ""Giulietta"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""sporty"", ""attractive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""honeycomb""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""darkened""],    ""bumper"": [""front""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
ALFA ROMEO 4C,"Designed as a contender against Porsche Cayman and Lotus Elise, the 4C opened a new chapter for the Italian automaker who dared to attack a segment dedicated to motorsports enthusiasts in a mid-engined sports car. The 4C was one of the most audacious projects made by Alfa Romeo after the world financial crisis from 2008-2010. It represented the company’s ambition to get back on its feet not just fast but in style as well. While it wasn’t a true supercar, the 4C was that kind of two-seater made mostly for track, but also good enough to travel with it from home to the event and back. In addition, by sharing most of its major parts with other Alfa Romeo products, the 4C managed to keep its price low enough to afford the carmaker to make a profit from it. Unfortunately for the carmaker, it was not as successful as expected, but it deserved a big credit for being the first Alfa Romeo to enter the U.S. market after the 1995 Alfa Romeo 164. Built on top of a carbon fiber tub made by the Italians from Adler Plastic, the 4C featured a light construction that barely tipped the scale with its 1,973 lbs. (895 kg) dry weight. For the U.S. models, in order to get specific requirements, the automaker had to put in more reinforcements, which added another 342 lbs. (155 kg.). The front of the vehicle resembled the Giulietta hatchback, and the tri-lobo front grille featured wider lower air intakes included in the bumper. From its profile, the 4C showed a distinct bodywork with a short greenhouse and wide air scoops placed behind the cabin. The wider rear fenders created a muscular look for the vehicle, while the sloped rear end included a generously sized windscreen. Finally, at the back, the automaker added two round taillights and a pair of side-mounted pipes underneath the bumper. The interior was cramped, with just enough room for two occupants separated by a low center tunnel. Here, Alfa Romeo installed the buttons for the gearbox, the handbrake, and two cupholders. Behind them, the 4C also featured a small storage compartment. It was the only one in the cabin since it didn’t have a glovebox. Behind the thick, flat-bottom steering wheel, the automaker installed two paddles that allowed the driver to manually shift gears. Behind the cabin, Alfa Romeo installed a turbocharged, inline-four engine. It was similar to the one placed under the hood of the Giulia GV, but the engine block was made from aluminum. Thanks to the improved cooling system, the revised electronics, and a better turbocharger, the 4C provided 240 ponies (237 HP) to thrill its owners. Power went to the rear wheels via a six-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox. Later, in 2015, the Italian automaker introduced the open-top version of the 4C.",ALFA ROMEO,"{  ""car-model"": ""4C"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""muscular"", ""sporty"", ""distinct"", ""cramped""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""generously sized""],    ""grille"": [""tri-lobo""],    ""hood"": [""short""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""included wider lower air intakes""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""side-mounted pipes""]  }}"
ALFA ROMEO 4C Spider,"The Italian carmaker returned to the US market with the completely new Afla Romeo 4C Spider in 2015. The mid-engine sports car was built in Modena where the engineers used special manufacturing techniques that would normally apply for exotic sports cars. The 4C had a carbon-fiber tub and many aluminum components to ensure a reduced weights of around 1133 kg. The engine mounted on the 4C was a 1.7-liter 4-cylinder that was able to produce 237 hp and 258 pound-feet on torque. For the brakes, Alfa chose a premium package to make sure that car would stop as fast as it went. The 2-passenger sport coupe was available with a base and a Launch Edition version. The standard equipment features 17-inch alloys for the front and 18-inch at the back. LED taillights, keyless entry, power side mirrors, air-conditioning, Bluetooth phone and media streaming and a 4-speaker sound system with an USB port and an AUX jack were modern features that made the 4C a good daily car as well. Different packages were available to get a more attractive exterior design with body-colored rear spoiler and sati-finish exterior mirrors. Leather could also be added on the instrument cluster and on the door panels. To raise comfort, the Convenience package would add cruise control, rear parking sensors and a better audio system. Getting closer to the 4C’s true spirit, the Track package added a carbon-fibre instrument panel and exterior mirrors, as well as a stiffer suspension designed for track. The safety features on the 4C included antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control, hill-start assist and both front and side airbags, plus a driver-side knee airbag.",ALFA ROMEO,"{  ""car-model"": ""Alfa Romeo 4C Spider"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""2-passenger"",  ""overall-design"": [""exotic"", ""sporty"", ""modern"", ""attractive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sleek""],    ""grille"": [""stylish""],    ""hood"": [""lightweight""],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""wheel"": [""17-inch front"", ""18-inch rear""],    ""doors"": [""power side mirrors""],    ""roof"": [""carbon-fiber""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""body-colored rear""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
ALFA ROMEO Giulia Veloce,"The Alfa Romeo Giulia marked the return of the famous Italian brand to the rear-wheel-drive architecture, which it lost it in the late '80s when the last Alfetta GT rolled out of the assembly line. After the Alfa Romeo 156 and 159, it was hard to imagine a replacement for the latter, which looked modern even after a decade when it was launched on the market. But the Italians dared to do something even bolder. They moved the traction to the rear wheels and entered the competition against the German premium brands with a very spirited Alfa Romeo. Among other versions, the Veloce was built to balance the performance/economy ratio. The Giulia came with wide headlights, sharp on the inside and extended over the fenders. A raked windscreen was installed for aerodynamic purposes. The cabin was moved backward, to enhance the image of a front-engine with a rear-wheel-drive car and to get a better weight distribution. The sleek profile sent the Giulia directly into the sport-sedan segment. Inside, the Giulia Veloce (speed) was fitted as standard with a 6.5” infotainment display, placed next to the instrument cluster for easier reading. The dashboard was not as conservative as other cars on the market. The bucket-seats in the front suggested that the Veloce version will live up to its name. The Veloce was available with either a 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline unit or a 2.2-liter turbocharged diesel. Both were mated to a standard 8-speed automatic transmission. The base model was offered with rear-wheel-drive, but an option for all-wheel-drive was available.",ALFA ROMEO,"{  ""car-model"": ""Alfa Romeo Giulia"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""sporty"", ""modern"", ""bold"", ""spirited""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""wide"", ""sharp""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
ALFA ROMEO Stelvio Quadrifoglio,"It was the fastest SUV on the Nurburgring with a lap-time of 7 minutes, 51.7 seconds. It was faster than many other sports cars. Alfa Romeo was back on track with the introduction of the beautiful Alfa Romeo Stelvio. It was named after the Stelvio Pass, from the Italian Alps, between Italy and Switzerland, and evoked its ability to climb the highest roads and still be sporty as an Alfa. The Italians built the Stelvio on the same platform as the Giulia, which also established a class's lap record on the Nurburgring. Centro de Stile Alfa Romeo made the design by a team led by Alessandro Maccoli. They imagined a shape that would be recognized as an Alfa Romeo due to its specific front end but still looks like an SUV. Its sharp, angry-looking headlights and the deep, big ""shield"" in the middle of the grille expressed power and performance. On the hood, the car featured exhaust vents for the engine. Its fluid side profile with sculptured door panels inspired a fast vehicle. In the back, four exhausts confirmed that it wasn't just a regular SUV. Inside, Alfa Romeo designers placed a binocular-shaped instrument cluster with the tachometer and speedometer's needles starting from a low (6 o' clock) position. The carmaker installed a TFT display for various information from the on-board computer between the two large dials. Unlike other versions of the Stelvio, the Quadrifoglio featured carbon-fiber trims on the dashboard, center stack, door panels, and center console. Under the beautiful SUV, bodywork laid a carefully engineered drivetrain powered by a 2.9-liter, twin-turbo engine made by Ferrari. The 50-50 weight distribution and the adaptive dampers contributed to the car's performance.",ALFA ROMEO,"{  ""car-model"": ""Alfa Romeo Stelvio"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""fast"", ""sharp"", ""fluid"", ""sculptured"", ""beautiful""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""specific"", ""deep"", ""big""],    ""hood"": [""exhaust vents""],    ""headlights"": [""sharp"", ""angry-looking""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""four""]  }}"
ALFA ROMEO Giulia GTA,"Back to the origins for its 110th birthday. The first time we saw the Giulia GTA nameplate was on a car released in 1965. It had a 1.6L engine and was manufactured in two different versions, for street and race. The latest GTA is the most powerful road car Alfa Romeo has produced so far, to be made in 500 units only. Although it might look like a typical Alfa Giulia, with its aggressive-looking front section, that's definitely not the case. The main focus was the car's weight, which is 100 kilos lighter than the Quadrifoglio – which means the beautiful 2020 model weighs around 1,422 kilos. To reach this reduced weight, the interior door handles were replaced by fabric door pulls, plus the hood, front and rear fenders, front bumper – they are all made of carbon fiber. The interior has a touch of the racing world. There are no door panels and no rear seats on the racier GTAm – they were ditched and replaced by a roll cage. The powerful engine is a 2.9 V6 Bi-Turbo which is made entirely of aluminum. It delivers 510HP in the standard configuration and the 540HP version for the Giulia GTAm. For an amazing sound and performance, the manufacturer managed to include an Akrapovic exhaust system. Alfa didn't announce the price at the car's launch. The full package will also include a helmet in a Giulia GTA livery and a full Alpinestars racing suit. While this car is fun on the track, it is also 100% road legal. Doesn't it look like the sexiest car of 2020?",ALFA ROMEO,"{  ""car-model"": ""Giulia GTA"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""1,422 kilos"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive-looking"", ""lightweight"", ""racing-inspired"", ""powerful"", ""sexy""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""carbon fiber""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""carbon fiber""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""fabric door pulls""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""Akrapovic""]  }}"
ALFA ROMEO Giulia Quadrifoglio,"Alfa Romeo made a surprising comeback on the sports sedan market when it introduced the Giulia lineup in 2016, mainly pitted against the likes of the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, and Audi's A4. But the Italian automaker had another ace up its sleeves: its cooperation with Ferrari. Thus, Alfa Romeo developed the beefed-up Quadrifoglio version thanks to the prancing-horse brand. This was not a regular sedan built to do school runs and weekly shopping. It was a high-performance sedan that could threaten the domination of other sports versions provided by the competition. The Quadrifoglio nameplate (four-cloves) was related to the carmaker's history, and it was used only on top-of-the-range versions of its vehicles. And this 2016 Giulia QV confirmed that one more time. The Italian automaker tried to make a statement with this unique version. As a result, it created a distinct front fascia from the rest of the Giulia's siblings. The car's aggressive look was emphasized by the lower bumper, which incorporated an apron with a broad, split opening. In addition, the mesh grille that covered it had a chicken-wire look. Alfa Romeo installed extracting vents behind the wheel wells on the front fenders and triangular white stickers adorned with the four-clove badge. At the back, the automaker added a carbon-fiber spoiler on the short deck, while four exhausts flanked the rear diffuser at the bottom of the bumper. Inside, the tall sports seats with integrated headrests confirmed the car's sporty designation. The black interior was garnished with Alcantara and red contrast stitching. Most of the dashboard remained the same as the rest of the Giulia range, although there were few carbon-fiber trims that adorned the cabin and suggesting that it was not a common version of the car. Powering this new Italian four-door sports sedan was a 2.9-liter V6 that produced over 500 ponies thanks to a pair of turbochargers. Customers could get the car with either a six-speed manual or an eight-speed automatic.",ALFA ROMEO,"{  ""car-model"": ""Giulia"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""sports sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""distinct front fascia"", ""aggressive look"", ""carbon-fiber spoiler"", ""four exhausts"", ""tall sports seats""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""mesh grille with chicken-wire look""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""lower bumper with split opening""],    ""wheel"": [""extracting vents behind wheel wells""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""rear diffuser""],    ""spoiler"": [""carbon-fiber spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": [""four exhausts""]  }}"
ALFA ROMEO Tonale,"Alfa Romeo introduced a new compact SUV at the beginning of 2022, creating a smaller brother for the Stelvio, which was already on the market for a few years. Named Tonale, the new vehicle shared some core-DNA design cues from its bigger sibling. Still, it focused on customers looking for a compact-sized car. Thus, it became the smallest vehicle in Alfa Romeo's lineup and marks a more aggressive approach to its electrification program. Its exterior design kept a similar three-headlamp design into each headlight, and the tall Alfa-shield was placed in the middle of the front fascia. A broad air intake in the apron complemented the cooling for the internal combustion engine and the vehicle's electric motor and battery pack. At the back, some might remember the former Alfa Romeo Brera in terms of design language, but with different sizes. The arched hatchback styling and the taillights were more of a modern interpretation of the 2000's Brera's look. However, the overall length of the Tonale placed it at the bottom of the Alfa's lineup. The interior was focused mainly on driving experience, with a tall center console that separated the front occupants. Even though it boasted a two-gauges instrument cluster, it's a TFT display. It was complemented on the center stack by another 10.25"" touchscreen that featured Amazon Alexa, with an option for a 12.3"" display. Based on the same platform as the Jeep Compass, the Tonale offered a choice of diesel and hybrid engines with front or all-wheel drive. In addition, all versions featured automatic transmissions. Unfortunately, the turbodiesel powerplant was not available for U.S. customers.",ALFA ROMEO,"{  ""car-model"": ""Tonale"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""modern"", ""compact-sized""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""tall Alfa-shield""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""three-headlamp design""],    ""bumper"": [""broad air intake""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [],    ""taillights"": [""modern interpretation of Brera's look""],    ""interior"": [""driving-focused"", ""tall center console"", ""two-gauges instrument cluster"", ""10.25\"" touchscreen""]  }}"
ALPINE A110S,"Unlike its sibling, the A110 GT, the S version was made for those who asked for more, and Alpine was eager to provide them a provocative sports car. With a rich motorsport history behind it, the Alpine brand was revived by Renault in 2017 and carried over many of its ancestors' attributes. Designed with performance in mind, the A110 S features a similar bodywork with the A110 GT. It sported the same four-headlights layout with round light circles. Its pinned-out nose sported the characteristic center rib that crossed the trunk's lid from bumper to windshield. In the apron, the carmaker placed a broad black grille flanked by a pair of scoops that channeled the air to the sides of the vehicle. Thus, they reduced the drag coefficient. The S badges that adorned the side sills and in the car's rear promised a sporty experience. The carmaker also installed a functional wing at the back of the vehicle, creating 81 kilos (179 lbs) downforce for high-speed cornering situations. However, even though it had a mid-mounted engine, it didn't have side scoops as other carmakers preferred. Inside, a pair of sport bucket seats with integrated headrests and high bolstering featured the Alpine badge embroidered on the front of the seatbacks. The carmaker placed an aluminum strip on the dashboard that crossed the panel from side to side, while atop the center stack, it placed the infotainment display. As an option, the Microfiber Pack and Racing Seats added more flair to the interior. Behind the cockpit, the carmaker placed the same 1.8-liter turbocharged engine beefed up to 300 hp (304 ps) paired with a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox. Its 44:56 weight distribution allowed a predictive, oversteered car behavior.",ALPINE,"{  ""car-model"": ""A110 S"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""provocative sports car"", ""performance-oriented""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""pinned-out nose"", ""center rib""],    ""grille"": [""broad black grille""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""four-headlights layout"", ""round light circles""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""functional wing""],    ""exhaust"": [],  }}"
ALPINE A110,"Alpine created a track-focused version for its nimble A110 following a simple yet effective recipe and created a car that could tackle many supercars on a tight track. Renault was known for creating mass-market vehicles and also some of the best European hot hatches, such as the Clio Renault Sport and the Megane Renault Sport. But in its portfolio, it also had the Alpine brand that it bought in 1973, a small car manufacturer that stunned the world with its victories in rallies. But fast forward to 2017, and the Alpine badge was brought onto the world's automotive stage with a new product: the A110. But for some people, that was not enough. So Alpine pushed harder, and in 2023 it introduced the R version of them. Featuring a 32 kg (70 lbs) lighter construction than its A110 S sibling, the R version confirmed that ""light"" was not enough for those who wanted to go faster around a track. In addition, along with the weight-reduction program, the car received a new look. At the front, the carbon-fiber hood sported vents and air intakes that enhanced the car's aerodynamics. In addition, a carbon-fiber lip was mounted at the bottom of the spoiler. To further enhance the downforce, the A110 R featured a swan-neck wing on the trunk and a new diffuser under the rear bumper. Last but not least, the car looked sportier thanks to its black greenhouse and carbon-fiber wheels. Inside, the A110 R featured a race-inspired cabin fitted with a pair of carbon-fiber sports seats and a six-point harness. But still, on the center stack, it left the touchscreen for the infotainment system. The dashboard covered in Alcantara prevented window glare, helping the driver choose the right line around corners. The car's underpinnings were also improved by a 10% stiffer suspension on both axles and adjustable shocks that could lower the car's ground clearance by 10 mm (0.4"").",ALPINE,"{  ""car-model"": ""A110 R"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""track-focused"", ""nimble"", ""lightweight"", ""aerodynamic"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""carbon-fiber"", ""vented""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""carbon-fiber""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""black""],    ""diffusor"": [""new""],    ""spoiler"": [""swan-neck""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
ARIEL Atom,"While the Atom started as an ultra-light open roadster fit for two and powered by a naturally-aspirated four-banger, the 2011 Atom V8 was a different kind of animal. In 2007, the Atom was powered by a humble, naturally-aspirated inline-four, then customers asked for more power. Then it the Atom was fitted with a Honda Civic engine that boosted its power to 300 horses thanks to a supercharger. This time, the customers were pleased. But something was missing from that supercharged engine: a V-8 sound. That came in 2011 in a 25 units limited production run and a price tag that could match a Porsche Turbo or a Ferrari 458. The Ariel V8 sported a new wing in the back that pushed the back of the roadster harder to the ground, increasing the traction. The carmaker placed two squared wide air-intakes for the engine on the sides, which differentiated the V8 from its inline-four siblings. The Ariel Atom V8 was that little something that made a difference. Something like a meal with or without salt and pepper. It started as a one-off vehicle, an experiment when the factory installed a rev-happy 2.4-liter V-8 at the back of an Atom chassis. In the end, the carmaker rounded up the engine to a three-liter displacement capable of doing 10,000 rpm and squeezed 500 ponies out of the naturally aspirated V-8. The engineers paired it with a six-speed sequential gearbox, which featured a clutch that wasn't needed while driving it hard, neither for the upshifts or the downshifts. Thanks to that combo drivetrain, the Atom was capable of matching a Bugatti Veyron Supersport in a 0 to 62 mph (0-100 kph) run.",ARIEL,"{  ""car-model"": ""Atom"",  ""year"": ""2011"",  ""size"": ""ultra-light"",  ""overall-design"": [""open roadster"", ""limited production"", ""wing in the back""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""new wing in the back""],    ""exhaust"": [""V-8 sound""]  }}"
ARIEL Nomad,"The same company that brought the super-light frame and engine Atom brought the nimble and off-road capable Nomad on the market in 2015. And it had more than the Atom. The Nomad was built for off-road. But not just any off-road trips since it didn't feature an all-wheel-drive system. It was a light buggy with a rear-wheel-drive with a windshield. That was the main advantage over an Atom. But they forgot to install a wiper on it. At least one. From the outside, the roll-cage structure was the vehicle itself. The entire construction of welded and joined steel-bars formed a structure that allowed two passengers, two suspension systems, an engine, and a gearbox. That was it. To make it legal, the car-maker installed rounded headlights and turn-signals and wheel fenders mounted on the suspension struts. It would be hard to call the seating area as an interior since it was in the open air. No doors or side windows. The exposed cockpit was protected from the front wind by a curved windshield made from a high-strength material to not crack at the first rock. The race-bucket seats were fitted with race harnesses. In front of the driver, there was a minimalist instrument panel and the ignition key. In the back, the Nomad received a K24 Honda naturally aspirated engine that was tuned to produce over 230 hp. The car could have been ordered with dedicated off-road tires or all-terrain tires, which were better on the regular streets.",ARIEL,"{  ""car-model"": ""Nomad"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""light buggy"",  ""overall-design"": [""nimble"", ""off-road capable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""curved"", ""high-strength""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""rounded""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""fenders""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
ARTEGA Scalo,"After financial troubles, the Artega brand was back at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2015 and presented its new creation: the Scalo. Named after a former glorious racing horse, the Scalo was based entirely on the Artega GT chassis left after the customers withdrew their orders. In 2006, Artega said that it would build 500 units yearly, producing just 153 units. With so many parts in the storage, the new owner tried to make use of them. It invested in a new drivetrain and unveiled the Scalo. Since the Scalo's bodywork was carried over from the GT model, they looked very similar. It even sported the air-intakes on the rear fenders, which were needed for the internal combustion engine. An electric vehicle does need some cooling, but not that much. The clear-lens headlights were slightly enhanced at the front, but they still resembled the one from a Porsche Cayman. Inside, the car featured the same dashboard, which looked very similar to a Volkswagen panel. Before closing the company when it filed for bankruptcy, its former owner already had enough spare parts for more vehicles, and that included some Audi seats converted and adapted to the Artega's design. The Scalo featured a pair of electric motors that powered the rear wheels. Its total output reached 300 hp. Artega found a very interesting solution for the battery system. Apart from the lithium-ion packs, it featured supercapacitors that provided instant power after a braking period, such as when it pushed out from a tight corner. The car's range could get up to 402 km (250 miles).",ARTEGA,"{  ""car-model"": ""Scalo"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""similar to Artega GT"", ""clear-lens headlights"", ""Volkswagen-like dashboard""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""clear-lens""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
ASTON MARTIN V12 Vantage,"Aston Martin prepared a final edition for the V12 Vantage. It was a loud and impressive farewell from the astonishing British supercar. The Vantage name was not new in the Aston Martin stable. However, it was associated with a V8 powerplant most of the time. Yet, in 2021, the carmaker confirmed that it will produce an exclusive final stint for the V12 version. With numerous aerodynamic enhancements that increased the aerodynamic loads up to 204 kg (450 lbs) at 200 mph (322 kph), the Aston Martin V12 Vantage was a striking supercar beefed-up with all the tricks in the book to make the big vehicle not only fast but also behave excellently at higher speeds. Ever since 2007, when the carmaker introduced the idea, brand's fans have been excited. But to do that, the final edition V12 Vantage had to be light. Thus, carbon-fiber materials were extensively used on the hood, front bumper, front fenders, and side sills. In addition, the integrated diffuser and the rear wing were made out of the same lightweight material. Even the battery was a lighter one. Inside, the car sported a similar layout with the rest of the Vantage range but enhanced with the Sport Plus Seats covered in semi-aniline leather. The Aston Martin badge was quilted and perforated as standard. For the technical department, Aston Martin didn't spare anything. From CCB discs (Carbo-Ceramic Brakes) to the wider track and stiffer spring rates. Last but not least, the twin-turbo V12 powerplant sent its massive power to the rear wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission and a mechanical Limited Slip Differential. Unfortunately, production was limited to only 333 units.",ASTON MARTIN,"{  ""car-model"": ""V12 Vantage"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""big"",  ""overall-design"": [""loud"", ""impressive"", ""striking"", ""light""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""carbon-fiber""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""carbon-fiber""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""integrated"", ""carbon-fiber""],    ""spoiler"": [""rear wing"", ""carbon-fiber""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
ASTON MARTIN V8 Vantage,"Limited to 200 units produced, the 2019 Aston Martin Vantage AMR was launched just a day before the penultimate round of the FIA Endurance Championship, the birthplace of the Vantage AMR. Aston Martin had a long motorsport history before launching the Vantage AMR. It wasn't the only AMR ever built by the British car manufacturer. Previously, it built the four-door Rapide and the previous Vantage in 2017, and also the DB11. Unlike those, the 2019 Vantage AMR was available exclusively with a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine provided by Mercedes-AMG mated to a 7-speed manual gearbox. On the outside, the look was enhanced with the addition of carbon fiber, which could be found on the front spoiler, the side exhaust vents on the front fenders, and the side sills. A carbon-fiber roof and mirror cases were noticeable, and, in the rear, a newly designed bumper that integrated the rear diffuser was also made out of carbon-fiber completing the overall look. A quad exhaust was present, instead of the regular, dual type. Inside, the carbon-fiber fever was noticed on more elements from the dashboard to the center console. Apart from that, the interior was enhanced with the extensive use of the Alcantara. But the designers could have used an aluminum gear-lever knob instead of a plastic one. The AMR didn't forget about modern technologies such as an infotainment unit, or air-conditioning. By using a manual transmission, a mechanical differential, and the extensive use of the carbon-fiber, the Vantage AMR saved about 200 kg (440 lbs) of weight. It also lightens up the braking system by using carbon ceramic brakes a lighter, 20” wheels. To help the drivers with the manual transmission, the AMR does the rev-match with up-shifting and downshifting.",ASTON MARTIN,"{  ""car-model"": ""2019 Aston Martin Vantage AMR"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""Limited production"", ""Enhanced with carbon fiber"", ""Quad exhaust""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""Carbon-fiber rear bumper with integrated diffuser""],    ""wheel"": [""Lighter 20” wheels""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""Carbon-fiber roof""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""Quad exhaust""],  }}"
ASTON MARTIN DBS,"Aston Martin said farewell to its mighty flagship lineup DBS in 2023 after it introduced the final version, named DBS770 Ultimate, which was available in a coupe and a convertible shape. The British automaker produced 300 units of this magnificent coupe, and the sales started long before the car was publicly announced. Compared to many other special editions, this DBS770 Ultimate didn't just provide a few new lines on the hood and new upholstery inside the cabin. Instead, it was a refreshed vehicle that included upgrades in all areas, including under the hood. On the outside, the DBS770 featured a new front bumper fitted with a broad air intake in the middle and a pair of lower-mounted scoops to cool the brakes. In addition, the hood featured a more aggressive vent that helped cool the mighty twin-turbo V12 that powered the car. On the sides, the Ultimate received a set of 21"" alloy wheels available in three finishes: Satin Silver, Sating Black, and Sating Black with Diamond Turned. Aston Martin also worked its magic on the car's interior and installed standard Sports Plus Seats wrapped in semi-aniline leather and Alcantara. These were stitched in a quilted pattern. As an option, the automaker offered a set of performance seats that were more useful for those who wanted to take the car to the track and unleash its full potential. Another visual upgrade was offered on the gearshift paddles, which were made from carbon fiber. Last but not least, a laser-etched DBS770 Ultimate logo was imprinted on the center armrest. Under the hood, the car was fitted with the same 5.2-liter V12 twin-turbocharged that was already known from its previous versions.

ASTON MARTIN DB12 Volante,"After creating the first so-called super-tourer, Aston Martin came up with the drop-top version traditionally named ""Volante."" The British car manufacturer didn't want to just cut the roof off and call it a day. It went even further and refined the entire experience of driving a grand tourer with supercar abilities and created a luxurious, British-style, two-door vehicle that could go blistering fast and challenge supercars on a track or on a winding road. But, unlike those go-fast vehicles, the Aston Martin DB12 Volante was able to pamper its users with second-to-none cabins and comfortable driving experiences at any speed. The British automaker was blooming, and its cars became more appealing after years of Ford's dominance. It could finally choose the engines and transmissions it wanted, not the same powerplants as in a Crown Victoria with some gimmicks added on top. But, most importantly, designers could create gorgeous vehicles without using Ford Focus blinkers or sharing the same parts bins as mundane cars. As a result, the DB12 Volante boasted a front fascia dominated by the massive wide grille that resembled the same shell shape as the former DB2 or other famous Aston Martin cars. Despite the general trend of creating slim headlights, the British designer Marek Reichman followed the same design language of Aston Martin cars and created swept-back headlamps with rounded edges. On the sides, he made the extracting vents for the front wheel arches on the upper side of the fenders, thus incorporating them into the car's overall design language. Like the coupe, the convertible version of the DB12 featured a raked windscreen extended almost above the middle section of the front seats. The rear fenders were curved and featured wide shoulders over the wheels. Finally, at the back, the short deck covered a trunk large enough to fit two persons' luggage for a weekend and, under the rear bumper, two wide oval exhausts poked through, being underlined by the massive diffuser. To keep the tradition alive, Aston Martin ditched the idea of installing a retractable metallic roof and placed a three-layer rag top that muted most of the ambiance sounds. Inside, Aston Martin created a combination of leather, aluminum, real wood, and touchscreens, creating a luxurious ambiance. To keep the grand tourer attribute alive, the automaker kept the four-seat solution, even though the rear ones were more suitable for small-sized dogs or some bags. Nevertheless, those seats were treated with the same respect, covered in leather, and featured elegant hand-stitching elements. Under the hood, the AMG-sourced twin-turbo V8 pumped out a healthy dose of power. Even if the world was dominated by electrified vehicles, Aston Martin offered its customers a super-tourer without any electrification help. As a result, the spark-ignited powerplant offered 671 HP (680 PS) mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. It is worth mentioning that it was a traditional torque-converter type, not a dual-clutch one. Even though these types of gearboxes provided smoother gear changes, essential for a luxurious grand tourer such as the DB12, with or without a fixed roof on top.",ASTON MARTIN,"{  ""car-model"": ""DB12 Volante"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""two-door"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""British-style"", ""blistering fast"", ""gorgeous"", ""grand tourer""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""wide""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back"", ""rounded edges""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""front wheel arches""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""three-layer rag top""],    ""diffusor"": [""massive""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""wide oval""]  }}"
ASTON MARTIN V12 Vantage S Roadster,"The 2014 Aston Martin Vantage S Roadster came one year after the Vantage S Coupe. It was the fast version of a GT, a true contender for Ferrari. The Vantage S Roadster was the most powerful and the fastest roadster ever produced by Aston Martin. It followed the path of the Vantage S, using the same engine and gearbox, but with an open-top, few pounds extra and unlimited headroom. The exterior look featured long air vents on the hood, as a statement of extra cooling needed for the big, powerful engine under the hood. The large, typical Aston Martin grille looked more like an open mouth with the black mesh on it. The carbon fiber elements on the bodywork only made the car look meaner, even though the brand itself was an elegant, yet sporty, one. The interior was a combination of luxury and sports cars. The sport bucket seats covered in leather with contrast stitches gave a special sense of luxury. On the center console, in the middle of it, there was the key slot where the key-fob had to be inserted. Since the Vantage S Roadster featured the same seven-speed automated gearbox, there were only few buttons to control it and two large paddle-shifters behind the steering wheel to use it properly. On the center console, between the seats, there was the ""sport"" button which adjusted the settings for the engine, suspension, gearbox, and steering. At the end of the day, the Aston Martin Vantage S Roadster had more in common with a true sports car than with an open-top Grand Tourer.",ASTON MARTIN,"{  ""car-model"": ""Aston Martin Vantage S Roadster"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": ""Roadster"",  ""overall-design"": [""Fast"", ""Powerful"", ""Elegant"", ""Sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""Large"", ""Open-mouthed"", ""Black mesh""],    ""hood"": [""Long air vents""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
ASTON MARTIN DB11,"Aston Martin introduced a refreshed version of the DB11 in the form of the DB11 AMR, which offered higher performance and a specific look. AMR is for Aston Martin, like the M is for BMW or AMG for Mercedes-Benz. These three letters stood for Aston Martin Racing, and it was the carmaker's department that handled all the racing vehicles and tuned them to win trophies in various racing events or prove that its cars were race-worthy. The AMR version of the DB11 was the last to receive an upgrade for its V12 engine and some other suspension components that transformed the sleek GT into a race-ready vehicle. For starters, the car received new and V-shaped LED daytime running lights inside the headlights. The lime-green brake calipers and the line surrounding the vehicle at the bottom made it look better from its sides. All 100 units sported a gloss-black roof. In the back, the smoked taillights completed the aggressive package. Inside, the carmaker added satin dark chrome accents for the gear selector and satin carbon-fiber trims. Its sports-bucket seats featured a lime-green line that resembled the British carmaker's colors on its race cars. On their headrests, Aston Martin embroidered the AMR lettering. The most significant changes were under the skin. Its thicker anti-roll bar stiffened bushings for the rear axle, and the 30hp added to the engine made the car better fitted for a race-track. Other than that, it remained the same supple GT that could provide a long and comfortable ride.",ASTON MARTIN,"{  ""car-model"": ""DB11 AMR"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""sleek"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""specific look"", ""aggressive"", ""race-ready""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""V-shaped LED daytime running lights""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""gloss-black""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [],    ""taillights"": [""smoked""],    ""interior"": [""satin dark chrome accents"", ""satin carbon-fiber trims"", ""lime-green line on sports-bucket seats"", ""AMR embroidered headrests""],    ""suspension"": [""thicker anti-roll bar"", ""stiffened bushings for rear axle""],    ""engine"": [""30hp added""]  }}"
ASTON MARTIN DB12,"In Aston Martin's more than a century of existence, there hasn't been a more famous model family than the iconic DB. For 75 years, the grand tourer went through ups and downs, from featuring in the iconic ""James Bond"" series to struggling in the market because of the British automaker's financial challenges. The new DB12 comes as a history-packed vehicle but adjusted to the luxury and performance that define sports cars these days. Having an impressive 0-60 mph time of 3.5 seconds and a top speed of 202 mph (325 kph), the Aston Martin DB12 fully expresses the power of its 4.0-liter Twin-Turbo V8 engine with the help of an 8-speed automatic transmission. To increase power, the diameter of the turbochargers was enlarged, and the cooling system was upgraded and redesigned to ensure the good functioning of the powertrain. For the power to be useful, Aston Martin developed a precise Electronic Power Assisted Steering (EPAS) system and an Electronic Rear Differential (E-Diff) capable of locking or unlocking in a matter of milliseconds. The new standard 21-inch forged alloy wheels have been well-researched and developed, receiving a 17 lbs (7.7 kg) weight reduction from the previous model's 20-inch wheels. Weight saving in the wheel zone is further extended by the Carbon Ceramic Brakes (CCB), which offer an almost 60 lbs (27 kg) weight cut beside the increased braking performance and capability of performing just as well when the temperatures rise to the highest levels. Complementing the wheels, the new grand tourer comes equipped with Michelin Pilot Sport 5 S tires that are developed to fulfill Aston Martins's engineer's requirements in terms of comfort and performance. For example, the polyurethane foam inserts beneath the ""AML"" marked carcass reduce the vibration and noise transmitted to the vehicle's interior for a smoother and more comfortable driving experience. From a performance perspective, the tires were engineered to suit in the best way possible the new DB12, offering excellent traction and stability in both wet and dry conditions. The redesigned front end showcases a more prominent and reshaped radiator opening, accompanied by a modified splitter. Enhancing these changes are the new LED headlights, which beautifully frame the front of the vehicle. The car's exterior is designed to simultaneously have a bulkier and refined look, providing a sportier aspect and a broader stance that can underline the ""Super Tourer"" identity, as Aston Martin calls it. Quality is the word that best describes the model's interior, combining luxurious jewelry elements with top-class materials, such as distinctive fine leather, manufactured in the British archipelago. Practicality-wise, the interior combines superior materials with updated technology to offer a unique driving experience. A surround Bowers & Wilkins audio system accompanies Aston Martin's first in-house infotainment system. Adding physical switches, such as the one used to navigate through the GT, Sport, and Sport+ modes, creates a better connection between the driver and the vehicle.",ASTON MARTIN,"{  ""car-model"": ""DB12"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""grand tourer"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxury"", ""performance"", ""powerful"", ""refined"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""prominent"", ""reshaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""21-inch"", ""forged alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
ASTON MARTIN Vantage GT8,"Aston Martin had the race in its DNA and after the 1959 win at the 24h from LeMans and numerous wins in GT3 and GT4 categories, it offered special models for the racing enthusiasts. In 2016, it launched the lightest Aston Martin Vantage ever. The British brand tried to keep a balance between sport and elegance. Unlike the Ferrari or Lamborghini, it steered toward comfort, and, somehow, their performance models were not over their competition. In 2016, the company management decided to build a car that should provide more grunt. And that was the Aston Martin Vantage GT8. The carbon fiber details on the front bumper, the special details on the grille, and the front spoiler enhanced the car's aggressive look. Even the wheels with a central log nut were there to show that the car meant business. Inside, there was a combination of carbon-fiber, Alcantara, and leather. Instead of rear seats it featured a roll-cage. The car was far from a daily driver or from any other GT car ever made by Aston Martin. It was simply, a track-day car that could have been registered just to take the driver from home to the track and back. The racing-bucket seats were embroiled with the GT8 logo. Under the hood there was a 4.7-liter V8 engine, handcrafted and signed by an engineer. The standard transmission was a six-speed manual, but a 7-speed dual-clutch was available as an option. Of course, it featured paddle shifters behind the wheel. The sport suspension and the sticky Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires were part of the package.",ASTON MARTIN,"{  ""car-model"": ""Aston Martin Vantage GT8"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""lightest"",  ""overall-design"": [""sport"", ""elegance"", ""aggressive"", ""track-day""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""special""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""carbon fiber"", ""aggressive""],    ""wheel"": [""central log nut""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""front""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
ASTON MARTIN V8 Vantage S Roadster,"The 2011 model year Aston Martin Vantage S was the open-top version of the Vantage S coupe model. It was an updated version of the 2005 Vantage Roadster. In 2007, a group of companies led by David Richards from the race-engineering Prodrive company bought the Aston Martin from Ford, while the American giant kept a share in the stakes. The new owner started to improve the vehicles and the S versions for the Vantage and Vantage roadster started to take shape. In 2011, Aston Martin revealed the new V8 Vantage S versions. Only a trained eye or a professional would find the differences between the 2005 and the 2011 model. Mainly, the front grille had six horizontal slats on the Vantage S and eight on the regular Vantage. New wheel design was introduced and some carbon-fiber elements on the front apron were added to the vehicle. The inside was reworked and a new infotainment unit replaced the older one, which was a carry-over from Volvo. The buttons layout on the center console was also affected, and the bottom knobs were moved upward, to add comfort and usability. Under the skin there were major improvements. The 2005 Vantage was introduced with a 4.3-liter engine, which was replaced in 2010 with a 4.7-liter unit that offered 420 hp. The 2011 model S offered 10 more hp over the previous year. It was mated to a single-clutch Graziano automated gearbox that sent the power via a limited-slip differential to the rear wheels.",ASTON MARTIN,"{  ""car-model"": ""Aston Martin Vantage S"",  ""year"": ""2011"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""six horizontal slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""new design""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
ASTON MARTIN DB11 Volante,"After successfully launched the DB11, Aston Martin prepared an upgrade for the car, offering more headroom in the DB11 Volante. The open-top version of the DB11 just made the British GT car better. Since the carmaker didn't want to make the Volante a track weapon, it tried to make it comfortable and luxurious. It had to show its owner's value, and that's what the 2018 DB11 Volante did. Aston Martin started the research for the open-top version at the same time as with the DB11 Coupe. Thus, it could make a car just slightly heavier than its fixed-roof sibling. The specific, shell-like grille on the front was a trademark for the British manufacturer. The headlights, instead, were different than what Aston Martin used to do before. A double-curved line and swept-back lenses enhanced the dynamic shape of the car. With the top down, only the A-pillars raised above the car's beltline. The vehicle needed just 14 seconds to open and 16 seconds to close the roof at speeds of up to 50 kph (31 mph). With the DB11 range, the British carmaker said goodbye to Ford's older buttons and stacks. The DB11 Volante featured a new design for the center stack, which sported an infotainment screen on its upper side. A touch pad, somehow similar to the one found in some Mercedes-Benz vehicles, appeared on the center console. A large, centrally mounted tachometer with a digital display in the middle for the speedometer took the older analog dials' place on the instrument cluster. Two additional screens flanked the center dial. The DB11 Volante was available with a 4.0-liter V-8 engine developed by Mercedes-AMG. Aston Martin paired it with an eight-speed automatic transmission.",ASTON MARTIN,"{  ""car-model"": ""DB11 Volante"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""open-top"",  ""overall-design"": [""comfortable"", ""luxurious"", ""dynamic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""shell-like""],    ""grille"": [""specific""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""double-curved"", ""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""quick-opening"", ""quick-closing""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [],  }}"
ASTON MARTIN DBX,"After cutting a deal with Mercedes-AMG, the British brand Aston Martin managed to revive its lineup and created the most powerful SUV from the market in 2022: the DBX707. Sure, the traditional supplier for the James Bond movie franchise was mostly known for its GT vehicles and sports cars and less for SUVs. Yet, since these vehicles were in high demand, Aston Martin introduced the DBX in 2020. Then, two years later, it brought the DBX707 version, which was the most powerful SUV on the market. When compared with its less-powerful sibling, the regular DBX, the 2022 upgraded version features some exterior differences. At the front, it features a bigger grille than its stablemate and a different bumper design with a wider lip for an improved aerodynamic load on the front axle. Aston Martin installed standard 22” alloys with a 23” set as an option. The side sills were also redesigned to reduce the ground effect on the vehicle while moving at high speeds. But the most evident changes are on the back, where the carmaker installed a wider roof spoiler enhanced by a carbon fiber lip. The bumper is offered with a wider lip available in carbon fiber trim. If all of these might get unnoticed, then the four pipes poking through the bumper were not. Inside, the most important upgrade was for the sport bucket seats with the Aston Martin logo embroidered on the headrests. But unfortunately, it featured a two-generation old infotainment system carried over from Mercedes-Benz. On the tech side, apart from the 707 hp V8 under the hood, the car got standard carbon-ceramic brakes with larger rotors than its sibling. Also, the 9-speed automatic gearbox was similar to the one found in the AMG GT, with a wet-disc clutch system instead of a torque converter as the regular DBX.",ASTON MARTIN,"{  ""car-model"": ""DBX707"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""powerful"", ""revived"", ""exterior differences"", ""improved aerodynamic load"", ""redesigned side sills"", ""wider roof spoiler"", ""carbon fiber trim"", ""four pipes poking through"", ""sport bucket seats"", ""carbon-ceramic brakes"", ""9-speed automatic gearbox""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""bigger""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""different design"", ""wider lip"", ""carbon fiber trim""],    ""wheel"": [""standard 22” alloys"", ""optional 23” set""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""wider spoiler"", ""carbon fiber lip""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""wider"", ""carbon fiber lip""],    ""exhaust"": [""four pipes""]  }}"
ASTON MARTIN V12 Zagato,"The 2012 Aston Martin Zagato was a derived model of the Aston Martin Vanquish V12 but slightly reshaped. Only 101 vehicles were made and they've sold them all before the production ended. After Aston Martin split from the Ford Motor Company, the new management started to make cars differently and, also, started to bring more smiles to its employee's faces. For starters, they went for endurance races with almost stock vehicles and one of the drivers was the CEO. Things got even better when they started to win races or, at least, win their class. The Zagato model was based on the Vanquish, but with aluminum body panels that were reshaped. On the roof, a pair of bubbles appeared like in the old-days race cars. The profile of the vehicle was completely different, with an aircraft-inspired cockpit. In the back, a big wing was installed on top of the trunk. Some said that the car resembled a Nissan GT-R, but since the aerodynamic was the same for everyone, the results could have been similar. Inside, there was a race-inspired cockpit, but with the usual amenities expected from an Aston Martin with suede, leather, carbon fiber and aluminum. It still kept some stocks from Ford, but it got rid of the robotized gearbox that brought a lot of troubles to the Aston Martin Vanquish. The engine was the same 5.9-liter V12, 510 hp from the Aston Martin DBS.",ASTON MARTIN,"{  ""car-model"": ""Aston Martin Zagato"",  ""year"": ""2012"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""Derived model of Vanquish"", ""Reshaped aluminum body panels"", ""Aircraft-inspired cockpit"", ""Race-inspired cockpit with amenities"", ""Big wing on top of trunk""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""Pair of bubbles""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""Big wing on top of trunk""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
ASTON MARTIN Rapide AMR,"2019 was a busy year for Aston Martin. After they showed their pace in racing, they entered the market with some new limited edition models such as the Rapide AMR. This limited edition Rapide was shown at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2019. AMR stands for Aston Martin Racing and their win at the 2016 edition of the  24h of Le Mans grew their wings even more. They showed a concept-car previewing the model at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show, and the limited production series version looks almost the same. It is powered by the same 6.0-liter V12 engine and the car promises to look and act like a direct successor with four doors of the Aston Martin DB11 AMR. The maximum power is 603 HP and a massive torque of 630 Nm (464.6 lb-ft), which is enough to launch the car from 0 to 60 MPH in 4.2 seconds (0-100 kph in 4.4s). Stopping help comes from carbon-ceramic brakes, which are offered as standard with a 400 mm diameter on the front and 360 mm in the rear. The interior is filled with luxury items, in the Aston Martin way. The stitches are matching the exterior color, either in AMR Lime or Galena Silver. The center console is made from carbon fiber and the seats are covered in Alcantara. As an option, the Rapide AMR can be ordered with a One 77 steering wheel. Starting price-tag is $240,000 in the U.S. or GBP 194,950 in the UK.",ASTON MARTIN,"{  ""car-model"": ""Rapide AMR"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
ASTON MARTIN V8 Vantage S,"Aston Martin took the 2005 V8 Vantage, tore it apart, and built it back and, when it did that, it left some parts outside then added a few more. The British carmaker didn't want to make a V8 Vantage to beat a Porsche 911 Turbo on the track. Aston Martin didn't even try to put it in the same league with the German supercar. It just made a better V8 and added an S behind the name. While the small carmaker didn't have enough money to develop a new car, it kept refreshing and improving the old ones, and it did that with incredible success. Thanks to the car's exterior designed by Henrik Fisker, it was a great shape to start from. There was a new lower front bumper at the front, which included larger air intakes to feed the engine and the front brakes. The splitter was tuned together with the lip-spoiler from the back to create a balanced downforce. Inside, the Vantage S was a mix between a luxurious GT and a race-car with its optional carbon-fiber and Kevlar composite seats with high bolstering provided better side support during high-speed cornering, and they were 17 kg (37.5 lbs) lighter than the standard seats. On the luxury side, its hand-stitched leather-clad door-cards and center console offered an exclusive ambiance. Aston Martin installed the same 4.7-liter V-8 from the standard V8 Vantage and gave it ten hp more. But that wasn't all. The new seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox offered a new experience, being both fast and comfortable. Another essential upgrade was for the exhaust system. Aston Martin hired a person to tune the exhaust until it provided a particular tune, much more pleasant to hear than any other flat-six on the planet.",ASTON MARTIN,"{  ""car-model"": ""V8 Vantage S"",  ""year"": ""2005"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""great shape"", ""balanced downforce"", ""luxurious GT"", ""race-car""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""lower front bumper"", ""larger air intakes""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""lip-spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": [""tuned exhaust""]  }}"
ASTON MARTIN Rapide E,"For some reason, Aston Martin chose to show its Rapide E in Shanghai, at the 2019 Auto Show held there. Also, they announced that they will build only 155 units of the model and the owners will be very proud of their cars. The Aston Martin Rapide E is the first electric vehicle from the British luxury brand. It is powered by a pair of electric motors installed in the rear, with a total power output of 610 HP and a truck-like torque of 950 Nm (700.7 lb-ft). The power is sent to the rear wheels via a limited-slip differential. The battery pack has 65 kWh and is installed where the 6.0-liter V12 engine and gearbox from the gasoline-powered Rapide used to sit. With all these, the four-door electric supercar is able to reach 60 MPH (97 kph) in under 4 seconds. The total range of the vehicle is 200 miles (321 km) and the charging capacity is 185 miles range/hour if plugged into a 400 V – 50 kW charger. Inside, the instrument cluster is filled with a 10” LCD, which shows all the important data for the vehicle. The Rapide E is also the most digitalized Aston Martin ever.

ASTON MARTIN Valhalla,"Aston Martin used all of its expertise and its Formula 1 drivers to develop their ultimate hypercar, the Valhalla. The British carmaker learned its lessons when it worked on the Valkyrie supercar and applied it to the Valhalla, but it was an important difference between those two models. While the Valkyrie was a track-focused vehicle, the Valhalla had to cope well with the tracks and the regular roads. They created the vehicle around a carbon-fiber tub with a mid-mounted engine. That led to a narrow and short front area, a greenhouse with a massive curved windscreen, and a carbon-fiber roof. Behind it, a snorkel-like air-intake allowed the air to get into the twin-turbo powerplant mounted behind the cabin. A carbon-fiber dual-wing that ensured up to 600 kg (1,322 lbs) of downforce onto the rear axle at the back. Aston Martin created a minimalistic interior with a pair of sport bucket seats crafted in carbon fiber and thin padding. Between them, the center console hosted the buttons for the gearbox. In addition, the British carmaker installed a digital instrument panel in front of the driver and a squared-looking steering wheel. The 4.0-liter V8 power plant featured a flat crankshaft for a better engine balance. The engineers paired it to an eight-speed automatic (dual-clutch) transmission. Worth mentioning that all eight gears were for forwarding. For reversing the car, Aston Martin employed the electric motor. The all-wheel-drive system featured an electric motor at the front and another one for the rear axle, which worked together with the 750 hp twin-turbocharged engine.",ASTON MARTIN,"{  ""car-model"": ""Valhalla"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""Ultimate hypercar"", ""Track-focused"", ""Minimalistic interior""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""Massive curved windscreen""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""Narrow and short front area""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""Carbon-fiber roof""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""Carbon-fiber dual-wing""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
ASTON MARTIN V12 Speedster,"Gone are the days when “wind in hair” was an idiom exclusively used for convertibles. But for the 2020 Aston Martin V12 Speedster the correct expression would be “wind in your face”. The almost one million USD supercar doesn't have any windshield or roof or side windows. Only some bodywork and some wind-deflectors. That's it! For some, it will look like a rocket on the road. The new V12 Speedster recalls past glories from Aston Martin's history. In 1959, Aston Martin took the first prize in the 24h of Le Mans race with the DBR1/1, with Sir Stirling Moss at the wheel. That particular model was an inspiration for the V12 Speedster from 2020. The car should have been shown at the 2020 Geneva Motor Show, but since it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 flu, it was only shown online. The long hood covers the 5.2 liter twin-turbo engine, which produces 700 hp and 753 Nm (555 lb-ft) of torque. Transmission is to the rear wheels via an 8-speed ZF automatic gearbox. Performance numbers are according to the brand's reputation. The 0 to 100 kph (0-62 mph) sprint is done in 3.5 seconds, while the top speed is electronically limited to 300 kph (186 mph).

ASTON MARTIN Vantage Roadster,"Aston Martin is a famous producer of low-volume and high-performance sports car that was founded in 1913 by Robert Bamford and Lionel Martin. In 2018, Aston released its least expensive model, the Aston Martin Vantage. The Vantage was in direct competition with the Porsche 911, Jaguar F-type and Audi R8. The sport car runs on a 4.0-liter, twin turbo V8 delivering 505 lb-ft of torque. The Aston Martin Vantage Volante is the convertible version of the coupe, released a couple of years after. It has the same AMG-based engine, producing 503 hp. The car rocketed from 0 to 60 mph in 3.6 and its top speed was 190 mph. The cabrio Vantage is was also known for its folding roof which was the quickest to pack and unpack, in only 13.5 seconds. It can also be operated at speeds up to 50 km/h. Talking about the roadster’s design, the biggest difference between the coupe and the cabrio is the front grille, which was previously used on older models, Aston calling it the “vane” grille. Of course, the B and C pillars have disappeared, while the A-pillar and the windshield are raked more toward the back. The rear of the cabrio remained pretty much identical to the coupe. Inside the cabin, while the two-seat layout and the dashboard remained the same as in the coupe, everything else was redesigned to make it look more modern.",ASTON MARTIN,"{  ""car-model"": ""Aston Martin Vantage"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""low-volume, high-performance sports car"",  ""overall-design"": [""modern"", ""sleek"", ""aggressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked"", ""towards the back""],    ""grille"": [""vane grille""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""folding"", ""quick"", ""13.5 seconds""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
AUDI Q8,"Audi introduced the Q8 SUV Coupe in its lineup in 2018, and five years later, in the fall of 2023, the German automaker launched the refreshed version of this vehicle. The Q8 was the first vehicle developed under a new head of the design department, Marc Lichte, and he was the one who created the brand's new design language. That worked well for a while, but by 2023, customers needed something fresh without spoiling the look of the vehicles. So, there were several exterior changes for the updated Q8, some minor interior upgrades, and improved drivetrains. On the outside, the automaker offered the wide single-frame octagonal grille with an option of piano-black color on it, apart from the silver or chromed ones available for several trim levels. Furthermore, the trims that visually connected the main grille with the headlights sported matching colors, emphasizing Audi's new headlamps on the 2023 Q8. While the entire range got full-LED headlights, the automaker offered an option for Matrix LED ones. From its profile, the largest SUV Coupe in Audi's lineup kept the same design. However, the automaker offered an option for black trims around the windows instead of chromed ones. The automaker offered the Q8 with wide light alloy wheels ranging between 21 inches and 23 inches for a better exterior look. Finally, at the back, the raked-forward tailgate featured a roof spoiler on its upper side. Another significant change for the taillights, which were upgraded from the formerly used LEDs to OLEDs. Inside, there were just minor changes to the overall look of the dashboard. Audi didn't even bother to offer a new design for the steering wheel since customers loved the existing one. Like the 2018 model year, the 2023 featured a pair of high-bolstered seats at the front and a bench seat profiled for two for the rear passengers. But still, it installed three seat belts there. Thanks to the 40/20/40 flat-folding mechanism of the rear seats' seatbacks, owners could expand the trunk space, which was slightly smaller than on its Q7 sibling. There was one noticeable improvement in the infotainment system. Audi added a few third-party apps for the MMI unit, including Spotify and Amazon Music. Under the hood, Audi carried over the engines from the 2018 model year but improved the eight-speed automatic gearboxes. As a result, despite offering the same power as the non-facelifted version, the 2023 Audi Q8 managed to get better acceleration times. In addition, the integrated belt-driven starter-generator helped the vehicle lower its emissions. The car could shut off its engine at lower speeds, such as when approaching a stop light, and then instantly restart it when the driver pressed the accelerator.",AUDI,"{  ""car-model"": ""Q8"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""largest SUV Coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""wide single-frame octagonal grille"", ""matching colored trims"", ""wide light alloy wheels"", ""raked-forward tailgate with roof spoiler"", ""upgraded taillights""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wide"", ""octagonal"", ""piano-black"", ""silver"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""full-LED"", ""Matrix LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""wide"", ""light alloy"", ""21-23 inches""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""raked-forward"", ""spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
AUDI SQ8,"Audi refreshed the Q8 lineup in 2023 after five years on the market, and, along with it, it added some changes to the sportiest version of it, the SQ8. The German automaker introduced the refreshed version of the SQ8 four years after the nameplate's unveiling in 2019. It was the most powerful version of Audi's largest SUV Coupe. It tried to express its performance in many exterior and interior details, which customers appreciated. As a result, with the 2023 facelift, the four-rings brand emphasized the vehicle's sporty character with sharper lines and upgraded interior elements. On the other hand, the drivetrain options didn't go through a major upgrade. For the exterior, Audi focused on details. The front fascia featured the same single-frame grille that was commonly used by the entire family. But the SQ version sported a satin-silver rim around it and visually connected the main grille with the headlights. It looked like it supported them. On the lower part of the bumper, the car sported wide and tall side scoops adorned with similarly-looking trims. These air intakes were not just decorations since they grabbed and conducted airflow to the front rotors to cool them. The new headlights featured daytime running lights at their upper section, right underneath the hood's line, thus creating the image of a wider vehicle. From its profile, the Q8 wore 21” wheels with 285/45 tires in all corners. As an option, the automaker offered customers a set of 22"" or 23"" wheels. At the back of the car sported a new diffuser under the bumper flanked by fully functional quad-exhausts. The new OLED taillights were connected via a light strip that crossed the raked-forward tailgate. Inside, Audi installed standard sports seats for the driver and side passenger with high-bolstered sides for better support during high-speed cornering maneuvers. Like its predecessor, it featured the Audi Virtual Cockpit display fronting the driver. The LCD could've been customized so the driver could display the navigation there, for instance. In addition, Audi's MMI infotainment unit was incorporated into the dashboard and featured third-party apps such as Spotify or Amazon Music. Additionally, on the lower side of the center stack, the automaker installed a second touchscreen for the HVAC controls. In the back, the carmaker placed the same leather-wrapped 40/20/40 split-folding bench suitable for three passengers, although it was profiled for two, and the transmission tunnel limited the legroom for the middle-seated occupant. Under the hood, Audi deleted the option for the turbo diesel powerplant that was available on the non-facelifted version. It left customers just the option of a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 gasoline unit that produced the same power as before. Still, thanks to the new belt-driven starter generator and improved transmission, the 2023 SQ8 was slightly faster than its predecessor in the 0 to 60 MPH (0-97 kph) sprint but had the same capped top speed of 155 MPH (250 kph).",AUDI,"{  ""car-model"": ""Q8"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""largest"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""sporty"", ""sharp lines"", ""upgraded interior""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""single-frame"", ""satin-silver rim""],    ""hood"": [""wider""],    ""headlights"": [""new"", ""daytime running lights""],    ""bumper"": [""wide"", ""tall side scoops""],    ""wheel"": [""21-inch"", ""285/45 tires""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""new""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""quad-exhausts""]  }}"
AUDI S8,"Apart from the luxurious limousine, Audi provided also an S-treatment for its flagship sedan model. The carmaker aimed it directly at the Mercedes-AMG S-Class. Unlike its main competitor, the S8 was available either with a standard or a long wheelbase. That made it a mix of performance and luxury. And it showed both in every detail. When Audi refreshed the fourth generation of the A8 in 2021, it didn't abandon the S8 model. The 2021 version sported a piano-black front fascia with a fish-net-like grille. It was a bold move in times when everyone else used hexagonal, honeycomb-style elements. Also, it used the same shiny dark areas for the side scoops and the lower part of the front bumper. In addition, the car's designers added carbon-fiber-looking caps for the rearview mirrors, enhancing the sporty image. A discreet lip-spoiler adorned the trunk lid at the back, while on the lower side, the four oval exhausts sported a chromed finish flanking the center diffuser. While the regular A8 was focused more on the rear-seat passengers, the S8 was centered around the driver's needs. Sure, the seats were also comfortable, but their higher bolstering areas provided more lateral support. Like its non-S sibling, the car featured digital displays on the center stack and a TFT Audi Virtual Cockpit for the instrument panel. The latter could be configured according to the driver's needs and preferences. Under the hood, Audi installed a twin-turbo V8 helped by an ISG (integrated starter-generator) to reduce the turbo-lag. Moreover, its standard all-wheel-drive and adaptive suspension helped the vehicle during hard acceleration and on high-speed cornering.",AUDI,"{  ""car-model"": ""S8"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""flagship sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""performance"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""piano-black"", ""fish-net-like""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""shiny dark areas""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""center diffuser""],    ""spoiler"": [""discreet lip-spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": [""four oval exhausts with chromed finish""]  }}"
AUDI R8,"Audi tried the RWD supercar market in 2018 when it launched the R8 RWS, which stood for Rear-Wheel Series. Even though the carmaker was mostly known for its quattro systems, which sent the power in all corners of a car, it knew that supercars' drivers were very comfortable with rear-wheel drive vehicles, so it did it. The experiment was successful, and the carmaker continued that by adding the R8 RWD in 2019 and the Performance version in 2021. From the outside, the car looked very similar to the rest of the R8 range. While the front bumper and general shape of the car were the same, there were a few details different, such as the mate-black singleframe grille, body-colored side air intakes from the rear quarter panels, or the carbon-fiber door-mirror caps. Last but not least, the RWD Performance version received a specific set of light-alloy wheels to lower the unsprung masses. Inside, a large, sharply contoured arch ran around the driver's area, creating a ""monoposto,"" racing atmosphere. In front of the driver, a 12.3-inch display was filled the floating-design instrument cluster. Unlike the rest of the R8 range, the Performance version offered a steering wheel with four control satellites to control the Audi drive select, the start-button, to activate the performance mode, and control the Audi virtual cockpit screen respectively. Since it was a performance-oriented supercar, it received a new powerplant enhanced by 30 hp when compared to the rest of the range from the same 5.7-liter V10. It was paired as standard with a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox that sent the power to the rear wheels via a mechanical locking differential.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""R8"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""similar to R8 range"", ""specific set of light-alloy wheels"", ""sharp contoured arch"", ""floating-design instrument cluster"", ""performance-oriented""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""mate-black singleframe""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""front bumper same"", ""body-colored side air intakes"", ""carbon-fiber door-mirror caps""],    ""wheel"": [""specific set of light-alloy wheels""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""new powerplant enhanced""]  }}```"
AUDI A3 Sportback,"The third generation for Audi's compact vehicle was launched under the sad auspice of the canceled 2020 Geneva Motor Show. But the car was launched anyway and Audi moved on. The new design lines maybe will catch on, but some details are strange looking to say at least. From the get-go, there are only three engines available: a 1.5-liter TFSi unit with 150 hp and a 2.0-liter TDI engine with two outputs, a 110 hp and a 150 hp, respectively. The standard gearbox is a six-speed manual, but a 7-speed DSG is offered as an option. The exterior look makes a bold statement, with some design cues around the front fog lights looking like horseshoes. The headlights are Matrix-LED depending on options or trim level, and the daytime running lights are arranged into a 3 by 5 pattern, for an easier recognition of the car. The length of the car has grown only by 3 cm (1.2 in) from the previous generation, to a total of 4.34 m (14.2 ft). Unlike the first generation, which had a rear independent suspension, the latest A3 has a semi-rigid axle for the engines under 150 hp. For the other ones, it has a 4-link independent system, which ads more comfort and better handling. The starting price for the 2020 Audi A3 Sportback is EUR 28.900 for the gasoline version with manual transmission in Germany.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Audi A3 Sportback"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""Compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""Bold exterior look"", ""Striking design lines""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""Distinctive front fog lights resembling horseshoes""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""Matrix-LED headlights"", ""Daytime running lights arranged in 3 by 5 pattern""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
AUDI A3 Sedan,"The Audi’s 4-door smallest car released by 2020 was the Audi A3. The dimensions of the A3 were changed for more sportiness and space and it was longer than the hatchback version with 15cm. The seats inside the A3 were positioned lower to offer more headroom and side room. The trunk of the A3 had a decent capacity of 425 liters. Talking about the design, the 2020 A3 look elegant and aggressive at the same time. The front was equipped with a large single frame open honeycomb grille in gloss black finish that was not only for design purposes but was also functional with flaps that went on and off. The headlights of the 2020 A3 were full LED and had digital daytime running lights, an innovation for Audi. Looking to the side of the car, starting with the central pillar, the roofline was lowered towards the back, a design that made the A3 look more like a 4-door coupe. In the back, a dissimulated aileron was integrated into the trunk lid. The taillights had vertical and horizontal stripes, strategically placed to emphasise the width of the car. Inside the cabin of the A3 we found a digital instrument cluster as standard, and users could additionally opt for the Audi Virtual Cockpit that brought a bigger 12.3-inch display. Audi started to focus more on the driver and designed the central display differently for the A3, as it was inclined to the driver.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Audi A3"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""elegant"", ""aggressive"", ""sporty"", ""spacious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""angled""],    ""grille"": [""large"", ""honeycomb"", ""gloss black""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""full LED"", ""digital daytime running""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""4-door""],    ""roof"": [""lowered"", ""coupe-like""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""integrated"", ""dissimulated""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
AUDI SQ2,"Audi introduced the Q2 in 2016 as a premium subcompact crossover. Two years later, it introduced the top-version, the SQ2, which was refreshed in 2020. While it wasn't the inventor of the permanent all-wheel-drive systems for street vehicles, Audi got the credits for popularizing it worldwide with the Quattro introduction. The MQB platform was the base for the SQ2 and many other vehicles from the Volkswagen Group. The German carmaker improved the vehicle to offer supercar performance in a small crossover package. The 2020 SQ2 featured standard LED headlights, while the Matrix-Led were available as an option. A redesigned front fascia with a black single-frame grille, side scoops, and lower-grille made the car looks more aggressive, especially due to the angular lines. From the sides, the aluminum-look door mirrors enhanced the sporty presence. Under the rear bumper, the carmaker installed four exhausts and a black fake-splitter. Audi offered dark colors for the 2020 SQ2, and it offered four packages for the upholstery and colors. Customers could choose between the standard leather upholstery, Nappa, or microfiber. The latter replaced the Alcantara materials. Inside the instrument cluster, Audi installed the Virtual Cockpit TFT display. Its sporty character was also noticed on the shape of the bucket-seats shapes, which received high bolstering. Under the hood, Audi installed the 2.0-liter TFSI engine, which was already known on other vehicles based on the MQB platform. It offered enough power to rocket the small crossover to 100 kph (62 mph) from standing still in under 5 seconds.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""SQ2"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""subcompact"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""sporty"", ""angular"", ""premium"", ""compact""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black"", ""single-frame""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""Matrix-Led""],    ""bumper"": [""redesigned"", ""aggressive"", ""lower-grille""],    ""wheel"": [""aluminum-look""],    ""doors"": [""sporty""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""black"", ""fake-splitter""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""four"", ""under rear bumper""]  }}```"
AUDI S3 Sportback,"A new generation of the Audi A3 was unveiled online in 2020 during the pandemic. But the show had to go on, and the compact premium German car had to be changed. The first generation of the A3 was unveiled in 1996, and it was an inspired decision. The customers who were looking for a premium car but small enough to fit in city traffic finally had an option. The BMW 1 Series and the Mercedes-Benz A-Class hatchback were released later. From the outside, the 2020 A3 looked surprising with its muscular stance. The lower side of the car was wider with flared front and rear wheel arches. At the front, the grille was wider and smaller than the one installed on the previous generation. The fake air-intakes on the lower apron were smaller. In the back, Audi installed the biggest roof-spoiler on an A3. On the lower side, the car-maker decided to get rid of the fake exhausts and the pipes were completely hidden under the car. Inside, the A3 took its inspiration from the Lamborghini Urus, with its vents surrounding the driver. A 10” TFT display was installed for the instrument cluster, with an option for a 12” panel on upper trim levels. Another 10” display was mounted on the center stack for the infotainment system, and under it, it featured the HVAC controls. From the technical point of view, Audi offered a choice of diesel, gasoline, and hybrid versions. The front independent suspension was standard for the entire range. In the back, only the versions with over 150 hp would benefit from the independent suspension while the less-powered ones had to stick with a twisting-beam system.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Audi A3"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""muscular stance"", ""wider lower side""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wider"", ""smaller""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""smaller fake air-intakes""],    ""wheel"": [""flared front and rear wheel arches""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""biggest roof-spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [""hidden exhausts""],    ""spoiler"": [""biggest roof-spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": [""hidden under the car""]  }}```"
AUDI Q5,"Audi introduced the second generation of the compact-size SUV Q5 in 2017, and three years later, it brought the facelifted version, enhanced for the Euro 6d standards. The German car-maker introduced the Q5 in 2008 as a compact luxury cross-over vehicle. It was in the middle of the world economic crisis, and that affected its sales. The customers appreciated the product, and slowly but surely, its sales started to grow. By 2017 it was already obsolete despite the 2012 facelift, so it had to be replaced. Between 2017 and 2020, new rules and regulations regarding the emissions and safety features forced the car-company to introduce a new version. At the same time, the design team worked together with the engineering department and restyled the car. The car's front featured a new, octagonal, single-frame grille with vertical chromed bars for the Advance trim level and honeycomb pattern for the S-Line. The license plate was placed on the bottom of the new grille. On the lower side of the apron, the design team installed taller side intakes in front of the wheels and placed the fog lights there. In the back, Audi offered OLED taillights as an option, while the standard was the regular LEDs. Inside, the dashboard offered a new look with a trim inlay that separated the lower part to the upper one. The new MMI (Multi-Media Interface) featured a free-standing look touch-screen on the center stack's top, and the rotary knob control used on its predecessor was deleted. Since there was more room on the center console, the gear selector knob was wider. The technical department had to work extra hours to bring a new engine lineup. At the time of its launch, there was only a 2.0-liter turbodiesel engine available.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Q5"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxury"", ""cross-over"", ""facelifted"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""octagonal"", ""single-frame"", ""chromed"", ""honeycomb""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""OLED"", ""regular LEDs""],    ""bumper"": [""taller side intakes""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""turbodiesel""]  }}```"
AUDI RS 3 Sedan,"Audi dropped the cover for the RS3 Sedan in July 2021 and it was fast enough to put some supercars to shame and threaten other performance vehicles of its days. The German carmaker already had vast experience in producing powerful, agile vehicles. It was the first carmaker to provide a powerful version for a sporty, compact-segment, premium car in the form of the S3 back in 1999. But, while its ancestor provided just 210 horses, the 2021 version came with almost twice as that. With a look that resembled those from renderings and mad tuners around the world, the S3 Sedan was a clear sign of revolution for Audi's compact sedan. At the front, its broad and black singleframe grille abandoned the small hexagonal design of former models and sported wider oval-shaped adornments. Its Matrix-LED headlights wore a new pattern for the daytime running lights. From its sides, the wheel arches were wider than on the regular A3 Sedan, and its sculptured door panels completed the side image. Unlike any other S-line package, the RS3 featured body-colored A-pillars and black door mirrors. At the back, a discrete lip spoiler adorned the trunk lid, while on the lower side of the bumper, the design team installed a diffuser flanked by a pair of oval exhausts. Inside, the sport bucket seats provided high bolstered areas needed to keep their occupants in place while hard-cornering. In front of the driver, Audi installed a fully digital display in the instrument cluster and a second display for the MMI (multi-media information) infotainment system. The rear bench was profiled for two but featured three headrests. Under the skin, Audi installed a 2.5-liter inline-five engine that provided 400 hp sent in all corners via a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox via a Haldex all-wheel-drive system.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""RS3 Sedan"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""powerful"", ""agile"", ""revolutionary"", ""sporty"", ""sculptured""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""black"", ""singleframe"", ""oval-shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""Matrix-LED"", ""new pattern""],    ""bumper"": [""diffuser"", ""discrete"", ""flanked"", ""oval""],    ""wheel"": [""wider wheel arches""],    ""doors"": [""sculptured door panels"", ""body-colored A-pillars"", ""black door mirrors""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""flanked""],    ""spoiler"": [""discrete lip""],    ""exhaust"": [""oval""]  }}```"
AUDI S5 Cabriolet,"In late 2016, Audi introduced the S5 Coupe and Cabriolet on the market, and by 2020 it was time to be refreshed and pass a new set of emission regulations. While its coupe brother was the main attraction for petrolheads who were captured by the car's performances, the convertible version was more of an open-top grand tourer. But despite its rag-top, it wasn't exactly the comfortable vehicle that a GT vehicle should be. Due to its stiffened suspension compared to the rest of the A5 convertible versions, it was more rigid, but it also featured more luxurious items. The S5 came equipped with full-LED headlights fitted as standard and a new, single-frame grille design for the facelifted version. It resembled the honeycomb grille from the mighty Audi Sport Quattro from 1984. Unlike its famous ancestor, the 2020 model didn't feature four rectangular headlamps, but only two wider ones. They were available with Matrix-LED or laser to enhance the view on the road. Its canvas-roof was completely retractable at the touch of a button and could disappear in under 18 seconds while driving it at speeds of up to 31 mph (50 kph). Audi enhanced the S5's cabin with a new MIB3 unit. The infotainment system featured a large, 10.1"" touch-screen display. The German carmaker claimed that the new unit's reaction time was ten times faster than the outgoing MIB2 device, which was already known for its responsiveness. The system allowed voice commands. The 2020 S5 Cabriolet was fitted with a 3.0-liter V6 TFSI unit. Due to the turbocharged direct fuel-injection system, the engine offered 349 hp. It was mated to an eight-speed Tiptronic gearbox and sent the power in all four corners.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""S5"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""rigid"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sleek"", ""angled""],    ""grille"": [""single-frame"", ""honeycomb""],    ""hood"": [""N/A""],    ""headlights"": [""full-LED"", ""wider"", ""Matrix-LED"", ""laser""],    ""bumper"": [""N/A""],    ""wheel"": [""N/A""],    ""doors"": [""N/A""],    ""roof"": [""canvas"", ""retractable""],    ""diffusor"": [""N/A""],    ""spoiler"": [""N/A""],    ""exhaust"": [""turbocharged"", ""direct fuel-injection""]  }}```"
AUDI S3 Sedan,"Before changing the generation, Audi did the last improvement for the third generation of its compact-sized sedan and brought the S3 Sedan to the market. Even though the A3 range was already old on the market, as a last push for the sedan version, the German car-maker made the last move with the introduction of the S3 sedan, a car that could serve as a family vehicle and as a sporty sedan as well. The beauty of the 2020 S3 sedan was the fact that it was a true factory sleeper. Unlike the RS3 sedan, it didn't feature the same flamboyant aerodynamic elements that could make it stand apart from the crowd. Though, some details could attract the eyes with the sportier front bumper and the bigger, 18” light-alloy wheels. In the back, under the specific apron design, there was four exhaust that could tell the difference between a regular A3 and the S3. Inside, the S3 came fitted as standard with the Audi Virtual Cockpit, which replaced the analog dials with a TFT display. In the middle of the dashboard, over the center stack, a retractable screen for the infotainment system was installed. It was a very elegant solution, but the system didn't feature a touch-screen monitor. The S3 featured a twin-turbo gasoline engine with direct fuel injection. It offered 310 hp and it was mated to a standard 6-speed manual. Power went in all four corners. As an option, the S3 was fitted with a 7-Speed S-Tronic (automatic, dual-clutch) gearbox.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""S3 Sedan"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""elegant"", ""sporty"", ""sleeper""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""sportier""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""sportier"", ""front""],    ""wheel"": [""bigger"", ""18-inch"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""four""]  }}```"
AUDI SQ5,"Based on the regular Audi Q5, the SQ version was the most powerful version for the German compact SUV on the market. The compact-SUV premium segment evolved, and customers started to ask more from their vehicles. Soon, the manufacturers began to give them what they wanted. Mercedes-Benz introduced an AMG version for the GLC, BMW brought the X3M40d, Jaguar came up with the F-Pace R, and Audi put the S before the Q. Unlike its main rivals, Audi was the only one to offer the sportiest version of its compact SUV only with a diesel engine. From the outside, the SQ5 looked almost like a regular Q5 with an S-Line package. There was a different front bumper with larger air intakes and big side-scoops. The ""singleframe"" design concept brought a massive grille at the front covering almost the entire area between the hood and the lower side of the bumper. Like any other S version, it featured silver casings for the door-mirrors. At the back, the designers installed four chromed oval exhausts. For the interior, Audi already offered various trim-packages for the Q5, but the SQ5 was fitted with more standard features. The bucket-seats with high bolstering provided comfort and side-support for fast cornering. Like its siblings, it featured the Audi Virtual Cockpit TFT display in the instrument cluster and the big infotainment unit placed on top of the dashboard. The flat-bottom steering wheel was enhanced with the SQ5 badge on it. An aluminum-look trim on the center console and door panels improved the sporty look of the interior. Under the hood, Audi installed a 3.0 V6 diesel engine. Apart from the turbocharger, the carmaker installed an electric-powered compressor (EPC), which builds pressure faster with an electric, 48v, motor.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Audi SQ5"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""premium"", ""compact"", ""powerful""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""front""],    ""hood"": [""different""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""front"", ""large"", ""air intakes""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""silver casings""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""chromed oval""],    ""interior"": [""bucket-seats"", ""Audi Virtual Cockpit"", ""infotainment unit"", ""flat-bottom steering wheel"", ""aluminum-look trim""]  }}```"
AUDI S5 Sportback,"Audi introduced the revised second generation of the A5 Sportback in 2020, during the world pandemic. Along with the rest of the range, the S5 was enhanced as well. Ever since the introduction of the Audi A5, the S version captured the attention of petrolheads around the world. Its four-door coupe silhouette, the sloped shaped, and the performances were significant acquisition arguments. The S5 was more than a car for five; it was a sports car for a family. The 2020 version of the S5 came equipped with full-LED headlights fitted as standard and new, single-frame grille design. It resembled the honeycomb grille from the mighty Audi Sport Quattro from 1984. Unlike its famous ancestor, the 2020 model didn't feature four rectangular headlamps, but only two wider ones. They were available with Matrix-LED or laser to enhance the view on the road. The sloped roofline remained the same, and so it was the tailgate with the retractable wing. In the back, under the bumper, the oval quad exhaust offered a sporty sound. The interior was upgraded as well. A large, 10.1"" touch-screen display was used for the new MIB3 infotainment system. Audi claimed that the new unit's reaction time was ten times faster than the outgoing MIB2 device, which was already known for its responsiveness. The system allowed voice commands. The 2020 S5 was fitted with a 3.0-liter V6 TFSI unit. Due to the turbocharged direct fuel-injection system, the engine offered 349 hp. It was mated to an eight-speed Tiptronic gearbox and sent the power in all four corners.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""A5 Sportback"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""four-door coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""sloped shape"", ""sporty"", ""family-friendly""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""single-frame"", ""resembling honeycomb grille""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""full-LED"", ""wider"", ""Matrix-LED or laser""],    ""bumper"": [""oval quad exhaust"", ""sporty""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""retractable wing""],    ""exhaust"": [""quad""]  }}```"
AUDI Q2,"Based on the MQB platform developed by the Volkswagen group for most of its cars, the Q2 was a subcompact crossover. It was not available in the U.S. or Canada. Audi made a good name for itself when it started to build the Q7. The luxurious, big, SUV, was a hit and it encouraged its management to offer SUVs in more sizes. The Q5 and Q3 were well received by the market as well. Their smaller brother, Q2, was launched in 2016 and refreshed in 2020. The angular lines of the Q2 were amplified by the new LED headlights fitted as standard. There was an option for Matrix LED. The big, black, grille in the front combined with the black scoops in the apron made a powerful statement of the car. In the back, the D-pillars were black as well, creating the sensation of a floating roofline. The taillights were modified as well and fitted with LED. Inside, there was a new design language for the gear-stick, the air-vents, or the gear-selector for the S-Tronic transmission. The upholstery was completely changed with microfiber “Dinamica” instead of Alcantara. Audi offered eight packages for the interior, from a basic to a luxurious or sporty one. The trunk was kept at the same value with up to 1050 liters (37.1 cu-ft) of space with the rear seats folded or 405 liters (14.3 cu-ft) with seats in normal position. The Q2 was offered with a choice of diesel and gasoline engines, all turbocharged. In order to minimize the diesel emissions, the TDI models featured two SCR catalytic converter systems. The Q2 was available with front or all-wheel-drive systems, with a choice of 6-speed manual or 7-Speed S-Tronic (dual-clutch) automatic gearbox.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Q2"",  ""year"": ""2016, 2020"",  ""size"": ""subcompact crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""angular lines"", ""luxurious"", ""big"", ""powerful"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""big"", ""black""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""angular""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""floating""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
AUDI TT RS Coupe,"The top of the range version of the third-generation Audi TT was facelifted in 2019, most of the improvement revolving around the design of the model, with most of the technical bits being left alone. Both the front and the rear ends have been redesigned, albeit in the subtle Audi way of changing things without starting from a clean sheet. At the front, the quattro logo now has a matt titanium-look and sits in the lower section of the grille, which is gloss black and surrounded by the hallmark matt black Singleframe. The side intakes found on its predecessor have been enlarged and are each divided by vertical strips that make car appear even wider. The front spoiler blade has the same color as the rest of the body but can be optionally painted in a matt aluminum look, glass black or even carbon. The standard LED headlights have been revised as well, while the optional matrix LED lights are even more responsive. The rear gets optional matrix OLED taillights, which have a distinctive 3d design and can put on a spectacular show every time the car is turned on. Most of the interior has been left alone, although Audi did specify the car with an improved RS package as an option. Among various exterior enhancements, the package adds red or blue highlights to the air vents, seat belts and the floor mats, while an extended version of the package also comes with contrasting design elements on the seats and center console.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Audi TT"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""subtle"", ""wide"", ""responsive"", ""distinctive"", ""enhanced""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""gloss black"", ""matt titanium-look"", ""hallmark matt black Singleframe""],    ""hood"": [""front spoiler blade""],    ""headlights"": [""standard LED"", ""optional matrix LED"", ""optional matrix OLED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
AUDI Q7,"The biggest Audi SUV has received a facelift at the end of 2019 and some improvements were long-awaited by the four-silver-rings fans. At first look, it finally received the octagon front-grill, which is already present on the Q8 and on most of the other Audi modern models. On the front bumper there is a new blade, which accentuates the sporty look of the massive SUV. The 19” wheels are standard on the Q7 or 20” for the most powerful version, SQ7. The engines received a well awaited mild-hybrid version. This means that a new starter-generator driven by belt will help lower the fuel consumption with 0.7 l/100 km. Due to this new 48V mild-hybrid system, the start-stop function can work bellow 22 kph (13.6 mph). The most powerful version is the SQ7, which offers 435 HP. There is also a gasoline-hybrid version with a 3.0-liter V6 engine under the hood. This one has 340 HP and the electric system promises to offer a 43 km (26.7 miles) all-electric range. Inside the cabin, the occupants should expect nothing than luxury and hi-tech. The new infotainment system allows multiple phone connections, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Of course, there are no dials on the instrument cluster. Only a big 12.3” LCD display, called Audi Virtual Cockpit and an optional head-up display.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Audi Q7"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""massive"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""modern"", ""luxurious"", ""hi-tech""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""octagon""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""new blade"", ""sporty""],    ""wheel"": [""19-inch standard"", ""20-inch powerful""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
AUDI RS5 Sportback,"Despite all-new generation of the Audi RS5 Sportback being unveiled in 2018, Audi thought that it would be a good idea to refresh the  entire RS5 model lineup just a year and a half later. The early mid-cycle facelift is a minor one regarding the car's overall design and technical areas, with Ingolstadt choosing to simply refine the model's design language and bring it more in line with its more expensive Audi Sport stablemates. The revamp also came at the right time to mark the quattro brand's 25th anniversary, and the model was unveiled alongside its two-door brother, the Audi RS5 Coupe. Design wise, it's difficult to pinpoint all the modifications, but almost every single exterior detail has been refreshed in one way or another. The large Singleframe grille is now even wider and looks flatter, while the non-functional vents above it hark back to the original Audi Sport quattro, which pretty much started the Audi Sport lineage. The facelifted RS5 Sportback has 40 mm (1.6 in) wider wheel arches, while the optional matrix LED headlights with laser light technology now feature darkened bezels. The model's side sills and faux aerodynamic diffuser in the rear bumper have also been redesigned and can be further customized with gloss black, matte aluminum or even carbon fiber styling packages. Powering the car is the same 2.9-liter, twin-turbocharged V6 with 450 horsepower and 600 Nm (442.5 lb-ft) of torque on tap, sent to all four wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Audi RS5 Sportback"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""wider wheel arches"",  ""overall-design"": [""refined"", ""sporty"", ""sophisticated""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wider"", ""flatter""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""matrix LED"", ""darkened bezels""],    ""bumper"": [""faux aerodynamic diffuser"", ""redesigned""],    ""wheel"": [""wide""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""faux aerodynamic""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
AUDI A4 Avant,"In 2019, Audi introduced a second facelift for the fifth generation of its premium medium-segment contender, the A4. It was an unusual move for the German automaker, which previously used to refresh its models only once during their models' lifetimes. For the 2020 model year, Audi offered the A4 as a sedan, a crossover (A4 Allroad), and a station wagon that the carmaker traditionally named Avant. Along with the updated version, the automaker also improved the infotainment system, drivetrain, and the overall vehicle's design. From the outside, the 2020 A4 Avant featured a front fascia fitted with standard LED headlights that incorporated six distinct blocks with LEDs for the daytime running lights system. Another signature design element for the entire brand was the singleframe design of the grille, which, for this refreshed version of the A4, was wider and flatter and sported a honeycomb mesh design. In addition, Audi used the same pattern applied to the side scoops for the S-Line versions of the A4 Avant. As a result, the entire vehicle looked wider from the front, even though it kept the non-facelifted model's dimensions. In addition, the lower bumper featured a much sportier design, with enlarged side scoops that cooled the front brakes. From its profile, the station wagon's shape remained unchanged, but the automaker added more options for the alloy wheels. Finally, at the back, the raked-forward tailgate was available with a power-lifting feature. Lower, under the bumper, the automaker installed a diffuser flanked by wide, rectangular, fake exhausts. Inside, the most significant upgrade was the touchscreen for the new MMI (Audi's infotainment system), which sat on top of the dashboard and tilted toward the driver. Its high-resolution TFT display provided acoustic feedback and had an increased resolution compared to the screen offered on the previous versions of the A4 (factory code-name 8W). Moreover, thanks to the new system, the automaker could delete the controls from the center console. Customers could order the car with a choice of three instrument clusters: a part-analog/part digital panel, the Audi virtual cockpit, and a head-up display. In the back, the split-folding bench seat offered enough room for three adults and could expand the trunk from 495 liters (17.5 cu-ft) to 1495 liters (52.8 cu-ft). But the most significant change happened under the car's skin, where Audi implemented the mild-hybrid technology on selected engine versions. As a result, those versions boasted lower emission levels. Depending on the engine and options, customers could get a seven-speed S-Tronic (dual-clutch) gearbox, an eight-speed automatic, or a six-speed manual with either front or all-wheel drive (quattro). Outside Europe, for selected markets, Audi also offered the A4 with the S-flavored version named S4, powered by a turbocharged gasoline V6 engine that produced 354 PS (349 HP).",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""A4 Avant"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""medium"",  ""overall-design"": [""wider"", ""sporty"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""refined""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wider"", ""flatter"", ""honeycomb mesh""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""distinct blocks"", ""daytime running lights""],    ""bumper"": [""sportier"", ""enlarged side scoops""],    ""wheel"": [""alloy"", ""varied options""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""flanked"", ""wide"", ""rectangular""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""fake"", ""wide"", ""rectangular""]  }}```"
AUDI A5 Sportback,"Audi unveiled a mid-life cycle refreshed version for the A5 lineup, upgrading the multi-media system, the car's look, and the powertrains. The German carmaker introduced the second generation of the A5 Sportback in late 2016. Usually, the refreshed version should have come in late 2020, but Audi rushed a little and unveiled it in 2019. Behind that rush was a reason: the introduction of stricter Euro 6d emission standards in Europe, which forced more carmakers to adapt their vehicles. Audi didn't just update the powertrains. It also asked the design department to work harder and do some visual modifications. Thus, the front grille received a new honeycomb mesh grille instead of the slatted one from the 2016 model. The carmaker added a set of aerodynamically profiled side-sills from its sides, while in the back, it installed wide trapezoidal tailpipes, which made the car look wider. Inside, the most significant difference was for the MMI (multi-media-infotainment) system. The new 10.1"" touch-screen display made the formerly used rotary knob useless, and Audi removed it from the center console. With help from new technologies, the driver could use the car without having a physical key. It used its Android phone as a key to unlock and start the vehicle. The connectivity features offered new options for live-traffic information. Under the hood, the A5 Sportback upgraded the engines with a new mild-hybrid system which lowered the fuel consumption and cut down emissions. A belt-driven starter generator helped the start-stop system.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""A5 Sportback"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""aerodynamic"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""stylish""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""honeycomb"", ""mesh""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""wide"", ""trapezoidal""]  }}```"
AUDI SQ7,"Audi took its biggest, heaviest, diesel engine and installed it into its biggest, heaviest SUV. This is how SQ7 was born and the result is not bad at all. It is tasty and wanted in the U.S. Installing a V8 turbodiesel into an SUV it is not the weirdest idea. But when everybody downsizes their engines, Audi just brought the big, truck size, 4.0-liter TDI engine. And just to be sure that they will rock the world around the vehicle, they installed a complex feeding system with two turbochargers and one electric compressor. The power output is 435 hp while the torque is also in truck-zone with 900 Nm (663.8 lb-ft). Thanks to an 8-speed torque-converter automatic transmission, the big 2395 kg (5280 lbs) SUV can accelerate from standstill to 100 kph (62 mph) in 4.8 seconds. The maximum speed is limited to 250 kph (155 mph). From the outside, SQ7 TDI can be distinguished from the other Q7 range thanks to the special front look Two huge air-inlets are placed left and right of the octagon black with six vertical chromed stripes grille. In the rear, four oval-shaped exhaust pipes can be noticed underneath the bumper. Inside, the luxury and sportive look is at home. Bucket-seats in front and a slightly formed rear bench are good for a comfortable ride. But in case of a rush, the passengers in the back will need to hold tight. Boot capacity is 803 liters (28.3 cu ft) for the 5 seat variants and 705 liters (24.8 cu-ft) for the 7 seater version.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""SQ7"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""big, heavy"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxury"", ""sportive"", ""tasty"", ""wanted"", ""complex""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""octagon"", ""black"", ""chromed"", ""special""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""rear"", ""four oval-shaped""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""four oval-shaped""]  }}```"
AUDI Allroad,"Audi launched the first generation of the A6 allroad quattro nameplate in 1989, and exactly two decades after the introduction of this model, it unveiled the fourth iteration of it in 2019. When Audi launched the first generation of the A6 allroad quattro, it was a daring move. Nobody could really know if a station wagon with air suspension would meet customers' needs. But they loved it. The car drove well on regular roads and could tackle some unpaved ones. Moreover, it proved very effective in snow-covered areas thanks to the higher ground clearance combined with the all-wheel-drive system. Then Audi was convinced that it was on the right path and continued producing the A6 allroad for every other generation of its mid-size sedan. Audi made the A6 allroad quattro as a version of the regular Audi A6 Avant. It was only available as a station wagon and shared many parts with its street-oriented sibling. Still, it had some unique details that made it stand apart from the rest of its A6 stablemates. At the front, the single-frame grille featured a satin-chromed surrounding, while the lower dam was adorned by a light-gray trim that mimicked an underbody shield. Still, the automaker kept the massive side scoops that cooled the front brakes, carried over from the rest of the A6 range. From its profile, like its predecessors, the 2019 A6 allroad featured gray, unpainted plastic trims around the wheel arches continued on the sides with silver-painted skirts. The back of the vehicle looked like most of the A6 Avant range, bar the light-gray trims underneath the bumper. Inside, Audi offered the A6 allroad quattro available in just three colors: black, beige, and brown. Its part-leather part-cloth upholstery was standard, while a full-leather interior was on the options list. Unlike its sedan and station wagon siblings, this crossover version of the A6 featured wood or aluminum trims. Fronting the driver was a digital instrument cluster named Audi Virtual Cockpit, which consisted of a screen where the rev counter and the speedometer flanked a center area where drivers could display the map from the navigation system or other data gathered from the onboard computer. Besides the upholstery, all seats were similar to those installed in the regular A6 Avant, featuring a split-folding bench seat in the back that could enlarge the trunk area. The German automaker offered this version of the A6 fitted with a range of three V6 diesel engines paired with eight-speed automatic transmissions. A hybrid version was also on the list. Power went in all corners via a Torsen center differential. But the most essential part of the vehicle was its air suspension, which could raise the vehicle up to 45 millimeters (1.8"") from its standard 139 mm (5.8"") ground clearance.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""A6 allroad quattro"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""daring"", ""effective"", ""unique"", ""crossover"", ""versatile""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""satin-chromed"", ""single-frame""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""light-gray trims""],    ""wheel"": [""gray plastic trims"", ""silver-painted skirts""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""hybrid version""]  }}```"
AUDI S4 Avant,"While Europe will receive the oil-burner S4 TDI, the rest of the world will get the delightful gasoline-powered S4. Its 3.0-liter V6 fed via two turbochargers are good for a total power output of 354 hp, only 7 more than the TDI version. Even the torque is lower at 500 Nm 368.8 lb-ft) instead of 700 Nm (516 lb-ft). But still, the gasoline-powered S4 Avant can cover the 0-100 kph (62 mph) in the same 4.9 seconds as its TDI sibling. For the transmission, Audi installed an 8-speed automatic gearbox with a torque converter that sends the power to an all-wheel drive system but more towards the rear axle. In the event of wheelspin, it redistributes the power to the wheels with the most traction. A torque vectoring system is used to improve stability, with minimum brakes. An optional rear differential is offered for a better torque distribution between rear wheels. Inside the cabin, there are two bucket seats in the front and a bench for three in the rear. Unfortunately, Audi didn't put more contoured rear seats. The S4 TFSI Avant has a 505 liters (17.8 cu ft) trunk space, enough for normal activities. Of course, the rear seats can be folded down so the maximum storage capacity will reach 1510 liters (53.3 cu ft)",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""S4 TFSI Avant"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""mid-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""aggressive""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""sporty""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual""]  }}```"
AUDI A4,"Audi introduced the fifth generation of the A4, also known as the 8W in the carmaker's terminology, in 2015, upgrading it once in 2018 and a second time for the 2020 model year. The German automaker usually didn't make that many changes over one generation of its cars. It used to perform only one facelift after four years after the initial launch. But the A4 was an exception so, unlike the 2018 update, the 2019 refresh for the 2020 model year was significant. On the front fascia was a new set of standard LED headlights with daytime running lights featuring six distinct LED blocks in each headlamp. Also, the single-frame grille was flatter and wider and with a reduced height. Thus, Audi could also redesign the lower part of the bumper, increasing the side of the lower air intake and thus reducing the drag coefficient. On the sides, the 2020 A4 sported new rear doors with a sculptured line on it that continued on the upper side of the quarter panels. Finally, at the back, there was a new taillights design, with horizontal reversing lights and an overall look that echoed the headlights. Inside, the most significant upgrade was the touchscreen for the new MMI (Audi's infotainment system), which sat on top of the dashboard, tilted toward the driver. Its high-resolution TFT display provided acoustic feedback and had an increased resolution compared to the screen offered on the previous versions of the A4 8W. Moreover, thanks to the new system, the automaker could delete the controls from the center console. Customers could order the car with a choice of three instrument clusters: a part-analog/part digital panel, the Audi virtual cockpit, and a head-up display. For the drivetrain, Audi implemented the MHEV technology on the entire A4 range, thus reducing fuel consumption. Depending on the engine and options, customers could get a seven-speed S-Tronic (dual-clutch) gearbox, an eight-speed automatic, or a six-speed manual with either front or all-wheel drive (quattro).",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""A4"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""flatter"", ""wider"", ""sculptured"", ""horizontal"", ""reduced""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""flatter"", ""wider"", ""reduced""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""distinct"", ""new""],    ""bumper"": [""reduced"", ""increasing"", ""new""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""new"", ""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
AUDI S4,"The world is turning against diesel engines but Audi insists that turbodiesels are not dead. Their best statement is the latest Audi S4, which is based on the A4 range. It is the most powerful version of the diesel engine installed into an A4. The engine is a highly tuned 3.0-liter V6, which can be found also on the big SUV Q7. Due to a twin-turbo and an electric supercharger, the powerplant develops 347 hp and 700 Nm (516.3 lb-ft) of torque. The engine is helped lowering its emissions due to a mild-hybrid system with 48-volts architecture. This stores energy into a floor-mounted battery and use it when needed. The start/stop function incorporates a belt-driven starter/generator. The transmission is via an 8-speed Tiptronic gearbox and sent the torque to a self-locking center differential, unlike other quattro versions from A4 which are using an electronic-controlled unit. A sport differential is available as an option. As for performances, the S4 TDI can sprint to 100 kph (62 mph) in 4.8 seconds. Inside room is enough for five people since only the front seats are bucket-type. The Audi MMI has the same large display in the middle of the dashboard. It supports Android Auto and Apple CarPlay and can be accessed either via a touch-screen.

AUDI S6 Avant,"Audi introduced the fifth generation of the A6, known as the C8 generation, in 2018 and reserved the unveiling of the S6 version for the following year, in the summer of 2019. The S-branded products were sought after by the brand’s fans since they provided more power, more performance, and sportier styling. All of them shared some particular details that made them stand apart from the rest of the lineups to which they belonged. Audi made the S6 available in two bodywork shapes: the S6 sedan and the S6 Avant, which was the carmaker’s name for station wagons. Strangely enough, the automaker chose to provide these sporty versions with completely different engines for the European market and for the North American one. While the folks from the Old Continent got a turbo diesel, U.S. customers received a turbocharged gasoline-powered V6 unit. From the outside, the S6 Avant looked very similar to the rest of the A6 range, although it sported a few unique details that made it stand apart. At the front, it featured a lower apron adorned by a splitter and a pair of wide side scoops that cooled the front brakes. The single-frame grille was silver and adorned by an S6 quattro badge. As an option, customers could order the car with a carbon fiber package that replaced the chromed elements and the silver door mirror caps with black ones. From its profile, a keen eye for detail could notice the lower ground clearance compared to the regular A6 Avant. At the back, the automaker placed a massive diffuser and a pair of dual exhausts that flanked it, although, in the diesel version, those were fake. Atop the tailgate, Audi installed a roof spoiler that allegedly made the car more planted to the road at higher speeds since it improved airflow. Inside, the automaker placed a set of sport bucket seats covered in leather and sporting the S6 logos on their tall seatbacks with integrated headrests. Fronting the driver was a flat-bottom steering wheel adorned with the same logo and the Audi Virtual Cockpit display for the instrument cluster. In addition, a second wide touchscreen filled the middle of the center stack. The center console that separated the front occupants housed the gear selector, two cup holders, and a few buttons, including the one for adjusting the sound system’s volume. In the back, it was the same bench seat as in the regular A6 Avant, although covered in leather and sporting a unique, diamond-shaped pattern. Under the hood, Europeans got a mild-hybrid system powered by a 3.0-liter turbo diesel that was helped by an electric compressor to achieve a maximum output of 349 PS (344 hp) and an excellent torque of 700 Nm (516 lb-ft.) that was sent in all corners via an eight-speed automatic transmission. Customers outside Europe were granted a twin-turbo 2.9-liter gasoline V6 engine that developed 450 PS (444 hp) and 600 Nm (443 lb-ft.) of torque. This version could rocket the massive station wagon from naught to 60 miles per hour (0-97 kph) in 4.4 seconds.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Audi S6"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""massive station wagon"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""unique"", ""planted"", ""wide"", ""massive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""silver"", ""single-frame""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""lower apron"", ""wide side scoops""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""roof spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [""massive"", ""carbon fiber option""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual"", ""fake in diesel version""]  }}```"
AUDI TT RS Roadster,"Just like its fixed-roof coupe brother, the most powerful version of the third-generation Audi TT Roadster was facelifted in 2019. As expected, most of the improvements were made to the design of the model, with the engine and transmission being almost identical as its predecessor. The revamped TT RS Roadster has new front and rear ends albeit in a very subtle way that needs a closer look to appreciate all the new details. At the front, the quattro logo now has a matt titanium-look and sits in the lower section of the grille, which is gloss black and surrounded by the hallmark matt black Singleframe. The side intakes found on its predecessor have been enlarged and are each divided by vertical strips that make car appear even wider. The front spoiler blade has the same color as the rest of the body but can be optionally painted in a matt aluminum look, glass black or even carbon. The standard LED headlights have been revised as well, while the optional matrix LED lights are even more responsive. The rear gets optional matrix OLED taillights, which have a distinctive 3d design and can put on a spectacular show every time the car is turned on. Most of the interior has been left alone, although Audi did specify the car with an improved RS package as an option. Among various exterior enhancements, the package adds red or blue highlights to the air vents, seat belts and the floor mats, while an extended version of the package also comes with contrasting design elements on the seats and center console.w",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Audi TT RS Roadster"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""subtle"", ""wide"", ""responsive"", ""distinctive"", ""enhanced""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""gloss black"", ""matt titanium-look"", ""hallmark matt black Singleframe""],    ""hood"": [""front spoiler blade""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""matrix LED"", ""optional matrix OLED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
AUDI S6,"When it comes to performance premium medium size vehicles, Audi is always on the podium with its very well known S6. This time, they did a different job, proposing a turbodiesel version for Europe and a gasoline one for the U.S. market. Yeah, we know the word diesels are for trucks. But trust us, you could love this kind of “truck”. Spacious inside, with a kind of mean look on the outside, the S6 is what the Germans would call an “autobahn cruiser”. The kind of vehicle that some could set the adaptive cruise control on the highway at 155 MPH (250 kph) and keep it on the left lane. The 3.0-liter V6 diesel engine is fed via a system comprising an electric supercharger and a turbocharger that boosts the maximum torque from as low as 2.500 rpm and keeps it up until 3.100 rpm. This might seem as a low torque range for a gasoline engine, but for a turbodiesel is more than enough. This flat curve torque sits at 700 Nm (516.3 lb-ft), helping the big sedan to stop the 0 to 62 mph (100 kph) timer in 5 seconds flat. To achieve this performance, Audi installed an electric supercharger that spins at around 70.000 rpm and compensates the air-flow when the turbocharger doesn't have enough air to spin. This set-up cuts the turbo-lag. Audi engineers installed the Quattro all-wheel-drive system and also an all-wheel steering system. On top of that, the suspension is enhanced with an electronic adaptive system. Last but not least, as an option, it can be fitted with a sport differential for the rear axle. For outside Europe, the S6 is offered with a twin-turbo V6-gasoline engine developing 450 HP and 600 Nm (442.5). This version is also fitted with the electric supercharger (EPC).",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""S6"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""medium"",  ""overall-design"": [""spacious"", ""mean look"", ""autobahn cruiser""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""mean""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""twin-turbo""]  }}```"
AUDI RS7 Sportback,"In late 2022, Audi unveiled the RS7 performance, the most powerful to that date version of the RS7, and besides the engine upgrades, there were also other parts that were improved. While BMW and Mercedes-AMG offered sedans for their M 5 and E63 executive sedans, Audi placed its bets on the station wagon of the A6, the RS6, and the four-door coupe RS7. The RS7 was, in fact, more of a hatchback at a larger scale. Something that neither one of Audi's direct competitors didn't have in their offers. The RS7 performance version didn't hide its power and boasted a front lower grille, side scoops, side sills, and the rear diffuser finished in matte gray. In addition, the standard 21"" alloy wheels were a statement about the car's performance. There was also a set of 22"" alloys on the options list. Thanks to their design, these wheels exposed the large brakes. In addition, Audi introduced two new colors with the performance version, the Ascari Blue and the matte Dew Silver. Inside, the carmaker offered a pair of high-bolstered bucket seats at the front and a split-folding bench in the rear. While it was possible to fit three people on the rear bench, it was profiled just for two occupants. In addition, it sported RS7 lettering embroidered on the seatbacks. At the front, the Alcantara materials were offered in a choice of three colors: gray, red, and blue. But the most significant modification was under the skin, where the 4.0-liter powerplant received a power upgrade. In addition, the carmaker installed a new, lighter center differential that could transfer the torque between the front and rear wheels faster than the regular RS7.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""RS7"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""large hatchback"",  ""overall-design"": [""powerful"", ""sleek"", ""aggressive"", ""sporty"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""front lower"", ""matte gray""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""21\"" alloy"", ""22\"" alloy"", ""exposing large brakes""],    ""doors"": [""high-bolstered bucket seats"", ""split-folding bench"", ""RS7 lettering""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""matte gray"", ""rear""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""4.0-liter powerplant"", ""power upgrade"", ""lighter center differential""]  }}```"
AUDI RS 4 Avant,"Even if the previous RS4 Avant offered the same power and torque as the 2020 model year, Audi fitted the newer version with a gasoline particulate filter and a twin-turbo V6 unit. In January 2021, all new cars had to fit in the Euro 6d norms, and that was a problem for most car-makers, especially those who had more powerful vehicles. The new standards were tighter and imposed new safety features and lower emissions. Along with the technical upgrades, Audi refreshed the exterior look of the RS4 Avant. The new headlights showed a different style, especially on their lower side. The singleframe grille design was extended to the lower part of the bumper, and a pair of air-scoops channeled the air-flow to the front discs and intercoolers. The marketing department added the option of badge deletion so that the RS4 could become a real sleeper. The interior design offered a new perspective for the driver with a new Audi Virtual Cockpit design and a new 10.1” infotainment touch-screen for the MMI system. The LED doors contour amplified the look of the black-only interior. Audi fit more safety features to the car than the Euro 6d norms requested. The powerplant was the biggest innovation. Instead of the older, 4.2-liter V8, the engineers installed a 2.9-liter V6 engine that offered 450 hp. It was paired as standard to a 9-speed automatic transmission, and, as usual, it sent the power in all corners via a Torsen center differential.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""RS4 Avant"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed exterior look"", ""new headlights style"", ""extended singleframe grille design"", ""pair of air-scoops"", ""badge deletion option"", ""amplified LED doors contour"", ""more safety features""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""extended singleframe design""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""new style""],    ""bumper"": [""lower singleframe grille design"", ""air-scoops""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""amplified LED contour""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
AUDI RS 5,"Even though an all-new generation of the Audi RS5 Coupe was unveiled in the first half of 2018, Audi thought that it would be a good idea to refresh the model just a year and a half later. The very early mid-cycle facelift is a minor one regarding the car's overall design and technical areas, with Ingolstadt preferring to simply refine the model's design language and bring it more in line with its other Audi Sport stablemates. The refresh also came at the right time to mark the quattro brand's 25th anniversary, and the car was unveiled alongside its five-door brother, the Audi RS5 Sportback. Design wise, you'd need a magnifying glass to observe all the modifications, but almost very single design motif has been revamped. The recognizable Singleframe engine grille is now wider and flatter, while the faux air vents sitting above it are inspired by the original Audi Sport quattro from 1984, the model that started the Audi Sport lineage. Wheel arches have been widened by 40 mm (1.6 in), while the optional matrix LED headlights with laser light technology now feature darkened bezels. The side sills and faux aerodynamic diffuser in the rear bumper have also been refreshed and can be further individualized with gloss black, matte aluminum or even carbon fiber styling packages. The 2.9-liter, twin-turbocharged V6 has the same output as its predecessor, with 450 horsepower and 600 Nm (442.5 lb-ft) of torque on tap sent to all four wheels.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Audi RS5 Coupe"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""refined"", ""recognizable"", ""wider"", ""flatter"", ""inspired""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wider"", ""flatter"", ""refreshed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""optional"", ""darkened"", ""matrix LED"", ""laser""],    ""bumper"": [""faux aerodynamic"", ""refreshed""],    ""wheel"": [""wider"", ""individualized""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""faux aerodynamic"", ""refreshed""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
AUDI RS6 Avant,"Audi unveiled in late 2022 its most powerful version to date, RS6, in the form of the performance version that provided more power and a specific styling. While both its main competitors, BMW and Mercedes-AMG, offered sedan versions for the 5 Series and the E-Class, Audi focused exclusively on the station wagon shape. This, in Audi's terminology, was called Avant, and their idea was to provide a vehicle good enough for a family and powerful enough to please its driver. In terms of aesthetics, the RS6 Avant performance featured some exterior parts finished in matte gray, such as the door mirrors, the front spoiler, the side scoops, the side sills, and the diffuser on the rear bumper. In addition, an option for carbon/black elements was available for the trims on the side windows. Last but not least, the four-ring Audi badge was offered either in black or chromed. The RS6 performance came fitted with standard 21"" light-alloy wheels with an option for 22"" alloys. Inside, beside the gray and red Alcantara RS design packages, the automaker offered an option for blue. Moreover, on the steering wheel, the floor mats, and the center console, the automaker added blue accents. As expected, the front sports seats featured high-bolstered areas to keep their occupants in place during hard cornering. Yet, the rear bench profiled for two sported RS logos embroidered on the seatback, with contrast stitching. But the most significant modification was under the skin, where the 4.0-liter powerplant received a power upgrade. In addition, the carmaker installed a new, lighter center differential that could transfer the torque between the front and rear wheels faster than the regular RS6 Avant.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""RS6 Avant"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""station wagon"",  ""overall-design"": [""powerful"", ""family-friendly"", ""matte gray accents"", ""option for carbon/black elements"", ""21\"" standard wheels""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""matte gray"", ""diffuser on rear bumper""],    ""wheel"": [""21\"" standard"", ""option for 22\"" alloys""],    ""doors"": [""matte gray door mirrors""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""matte gray""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
AUDI A6 Avant,"Audi unveiled the sixth generation of the A6 Avant in 2018, along with its three-box sedan brother, before the Geneva Motor Show. The A6 Avant continued the station wagon shapes for the German premium carmaker. Even though it didn't offer the biggest trunk in its segment, the car was able to carry more than enough luggage. Surprisingly, it didn't offer more storage area than its predecessor, but Audi's engineers were more focused on other areas. Its new look was aggressive for a family station wagon but preferred by the Audi customers. It sported a singleframe grille with horizontal slats and LED headlights, and daytime running lights. Its wide side-scoops from the bumper suggested that they were used to cool the front brakes. From its sides, the A6 Avant featured an extended roof slightly sloped down toward the raked-forward tailgate. In the back, the carmaker installed standard LED taillights. Its rear bumper featured two fake wide exhausts. Inside, Audi worked hard to keep up with the best in business carmakers. As usual, it offered a carefully crafted interior with high-quality materials and finishes. In front of the driver, the instrument cluster featured a 12.3"" digital display (Audi Virtual Cockpit). On the center stack, the carmaker introduced a newly developed MMI (Multi Media Interface) with an up to 10.1"" touch screen. Under the hood, the biggest surprise was the mild-hybrid version, which allowed the big vehicle to coast with the engine shut off at speeds between 55 and 160 kph (34 – 99 mph). In total, Audi offered a choice of eight engines with front or all-wheel-drive systems.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""A6 Avant"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""station wagon"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""premium"", ""extended"", ""sloped"", ""wide""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""singleframe"", ""horizontal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""wide"", ""scooped"", ""cooling""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""extended"", ""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""fake"", ""wide""]  }}```"
AUDI A6,"The midline sedan reached the 8th generation in 2018 with the launched of the new A6. The A6 was a strong rival for the Mercedes E-Class and the BMW 5-Series. The new A6 was offered in four trim levels: Premium, Sport, Premium Plus and Prestige. The sportier version of the A6 was represented by the S6. The Premium model looked good even if it was the base level, with the specific Audi aggressive front end and the sporty back with the beautifully designed taillights. From the side, the A6 looked like a larger sedan.  The base model also came with 18-inch alloy wheels. The impeccably crafted interior was equipped with nice and soft leather upholstery and it was a nice combination of sportiness and luxury. Heated seats were offered standard and offered great support and comfort for the driver and the passengers. Plenty of room was offered and the back seats were great for adults as well, with decent legroom and headroom for a comfortable long journey. The load area also offered great room for luggages. The base version included a standard sunroof. Performance wise, the A6 was available with two engines: an entry level 2.0-liter 4-cylinder turbocharged engine developing 252 hp and the more powerful 3.0 6-cylinder supercharged powerplant with 340 hp. Both engines were mated with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The A6 would have reached 100 kph in around 6.7 seconds with the 2.0-liter and around 5.1 seconds with the supercharged engine. Even with the entry level engine, the A6 offered adequate power to offer a fun, comfortable ride.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""A6"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""larger sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive front end"", ""sporty back"", ""impeccably crafted interior"", ""nice combination of sportiness and luxury""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""beautifully designed""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""18-inch alloy wheels""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""standard sunroof""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
AUDI Q3,"One of the smallest SUVs produced by Audi was redesigned in 2018 to look sportier. The redesigned headlamps, along with the large air inlets and the Audi’s new single-frame grille, defined a more masculine SUV like front-end. From the side, the Q3 looked more muscular, with the shoulder line connecting the headlights and the rear lights. The Q3 came with optional 20-inch beautiful alloy wheels. The biggest change came with the Audi’s new interior design. It was entirely made of nice and soft touch materials, with lots of customisation available throughout the trim levels available. From optional orange Alcantara accents on the door trims as well as on the dash, wood trims and aluminum door handles to standard leather seats, the new Q3 provided a unique design and offered great comfort even with the base model. Audi designed the interior to be driver oriented, with the most of the controls and the display being 10 degrees tilted towards the driver. The Q3 had keyless entry and keyless go, lots of safety features such as standard emergency braking system and automatic high beam headlights. Lane departure assist was also available. The Q3 came with an optional Bang & Olufsen Premium Sound System that used 15 speakers to provide three-dimensional audio.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Q3"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""small SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""masculine"", ""muscular"", ""driver-oriented"", ""comfortable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""large"", ""single-frame""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""redesigned""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""20-inch"", ""beautiful"", ""alloy""],    ""doors"": [""optional orange Alcantara accents"", ""wood trims"", ""aluminum door handles"", ""driver-oriented""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
AUDI A1,"Audi introduced a small-sized crossover vehicle on the market in 2019 based on the same platform as its small-sized family member, the A1. Crossovers and SUVs were selling like hotcakes, and thanks to its vast experience in the all-wheel drive sector, Audi claimed a big chunk of the market. And yet, in the premium subcompact segment, it didn't have anything to put on the table against MINI's Countryman. So, the citycarver was invented to fill that gap. Audi's design department had modified the front fascia of the citycarver compared to the one fitted on the A1. It still sported the same headlights, but the bumper was slightly altered with some additional trims on the lower side and on the side scoops that flanked the massive singleframe grille. On its profile, the raised ground clearance by almost two inches (50 mm) confirmed the crossover stance. Finally, at the back, the car had used the same taillights as the A1 but a beefier bumper adorned with black cladding. The automaker didn't think that the car's interior should differ profoundly from the one fitted in its non-crossoverized sibling, the regular A1. Thus, it installed the same Audi Virtual Cockpit with a TFT display in the instrument cluster, complemented by a 10.1"" touchscreen placed atop the center stack for the infotainment system. Yet, there were a few interior trims that were specific for this version. Powering this subcompact crossover was a 1.0-liter inline-three or a 1.5-liter inline-four powerplant, available in three power outputs. These were mated to either five or six-speed manuals or a seven-speed automatic. Yet, none of the versions was all-wheel drive.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""citycarver"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""crossover"", ""premium"", ""subcompact"", ""raised ground clearance"", ""beefier bumper""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""massive singleframe""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""same as A1""],    ""bumper"": [""slightly altered"", ""additional trims"", ""black cladding""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
AUDI R8 Spyder,"Audi introduced the Spyder version of the R8 Performance RWD in the summer of 2021 and continued the idea of offering a lighter, more affordable version of its supercar. In 2018, the German carmaker tested the market with the R8 RWS (Rear Wheel Series) version that sent the power only to the rear wheels, removing the famous quattro all-wheel drive system. The customers reacted well, and the sales figures increased. So, the four-rings brand continued the saga of RWD cars. In 2021, the carmaker introduced the R8 Performance RWD Spyder as an open-top vehicle that sat on an upgraded drivetrain, similar to the one installed on the coupe version. Like its stablemate, the Performance RWD Spyder received a few exterior upgrades. Overall, its bumper was the same, but there were a few details different, such as the mate-black singleframe grille, while on the sides, its air intakes from the rear quarter panels received a body-colored treatment. Last but not least, the RWD Performance version received a specific set of light-alloy wheels of 19"" at the front and 20"" at the rear to lower the unsprung masses. In the cockpit, a large, sharply contoured arch ran around the driver's area, creating a ""monoposto,"" racing atmosphere. In front of the driver, a 12.3-inch display was filled the floating-design instrument cluster. Unlike the rest of the R8 range, the Performance version offered a steering wheel with four control satellites to control the Audi drive select, the start-button, to activate the performance mode, and control the Audi virtual cockpit screen respectively. Since it was a performance-oriented supercar, it received a new powerplant enhanced by 30 hp when compared to the rest of the range from the same 5.7-liter V10. It was paired as standard with a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox.",AUDI,"{  ""car-model"": ""R8 Performance RWD Spyder"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""lighter"", ""affordable"", ""open-top""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""mate-black""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""same"", ""details different""],    ""wheel"": [""19-inch front"", ""20-inch rear""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
AUDI TT Roadster,"In late 2020, Audi unveiled a new version of its acclaimed compact roadster, the TTS. Since its introduction in 1998, Audi TT was one of the most praised cars from the German carmaker lineup. Its shapes, initially designed by Peter Schreyer, looked like no other compact coupe on the market. The evolution followed, and in 2020 the car reached its third generation, which was launched in 2014. Despite a world pandemic situation, Audi pushed harder and introduced the Competition Plus for the TTS range. The German carmaker installed standard LED headlights and a black Audi rings at the front. A black splitter was placed at the bottom of the apron. From its sides, the TTS Roadster Competition Plus showed the standard 20"" light-alloy 10-spoke wheels and, behind them, a set of red-painted brake calipers. Its 39 kg (86 lbs) soft top could have been open and closed in 10 seconds at speeds up to 50 kph (31 mph). In the rear, a fixed-wing on the trunk amplified the car's sportiness. Under the car, separated by a glossy black diffuser, the carmaker placed the four oval exhausts. Inside, the driver stood in front of a 12.3 virtual cockpit that replaced the analog dials as a standard feature of the car. The Nappa leather with red or blue contrast stitching enhanced the interior's look. The attention to detail was great, and the designers decided to add a stitched 12 o'clock marker red or gray on the flat-bottom steering wheel. The TTS Roadster Competition Plus featured magnetic ride control for the suspension and a Quattro all-wheel-drive system. Power came from the 2.0-liter TFSI engine pushed to provide 320 hp via a 7-speed S-Tronic gearbox (dual-clutch).",AUDI,"{  ""car-model"": ""TTS"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""acclaimed"", ""praised"", ""sporty"", ""unique""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sleek""],    ""grille"": [""black""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""black"", ""splitter""],    ""wheel"": [""20-inch"", ""10-spoke""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""soft top""],    ""diffusor"": [""glossy black""],    ""spoiler"": [""fixed-wing""],    ""exhaust"": [""oval"", ""four""]  }}"

The evolution followed, and in 2020 the car reached its third generation, which was launched in 2014. Despite a world pandemic situation, Audi pushed harder and introduced the Competition Plus for the TTS range. The German carmaker installed standard LED headlights and a black Audi rings at the front. A black splitter was placed at the bottom of the apron. From its sides, the TTS Competition Plus showed the standard 20"" light-alloy 10-spoke wheels and, behind them, a set of red-painted brake calipers. In the rear, a fixed-wing on the trunk amplified the car's sportiness. Under the car, separated by a glossy black diffuser, the carmaker placed the four oval exhausts. Inside, the driver stood in front of a 12.3 virtual cockpit that replaced the analog dials as a standard feature of the car. The Nappa leather with red or blue contrast stitching enhanced the interior's look. The attention to detail was great, and the designers decided to add a stitched 12 o'clock marker red or gray on the flat-bottom steering wheel. The TTS Competition Plus featured magnetic ride control for the suspension and a Quattro all-wheel-drive system. Power came from the 2.0-liter TFSI engine pushed to provide 320 hp via a 7-speed S-Tronic gearbox (dual-clutch).",AUDI,"{  ""car-model"": ""TTS"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""acclaimed"", ""sporty"", ""unique"", ""aggressive"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""black splitter""],    ""wheel"": [""20\"" light-alloy 10-spoke""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""glossy black""],    ""spoiler"": [""fixed-wing""],    ""exhaust"": [""four oval""]  }}"
AUDI RS 3 Sportback,"After more than 25 years since the introduction of the A3 lineup, the compact premium model evolved into a range of a few body shapes, but without dropping the original hatchback version. When Audi launched the first-generation S3 in 1999, it tried to offer something special for the hot-hatch segment, and it managed to surprise its customers with the 210 hp sporty vehicle. When those ponies were not enough anymore, the carmaker stormed the market with the 340 hp RS3 in 2010. But in 2021, Audi raised the bar furthermore with a new generation: the 400 horses RS3. Audi didn't make the RS3 to be subtle at all. It wasn't a sleeper by any means. Instead, it showed a very aggressive front fascia with a broad singleframe grille that sported an oval-shaped pattern. Its Matrix-LED headlights incorporated the daytime running lights, and a pair of huge side scoops adorned the lower part of the bumper. From its sides, the enlarged fenders, both front, and rear resembled those installed on the mighty Audi S1 from the '80s. Inside, the sport bucket seats provided high bolstered areas to keep their occupants in place while hard-cornering. In front of the driver, Audi installed a fully digital display in the instrument cluster and a second display for the MMI (multi-media information) infotainment system. The rear bench was profiled for two but featured three headrests and offered a 40/20/40 split-folding system that expanded the trunk space from a mere 283 liters (10 cu-ft) to 1,104 liters (39 cu-ft). Under the hood, the carmaker kept the inline-five turbocharged engine configuration with a unique firing order of 1-2-4-5-3. To increase the cornering speed, the RS3 sat lower by 25 mm (1”) than its A3 sibling or 10 mm (0.4”) than the S3. A seven-speed (dual-clutch) automatic transmission sent the power in all corners.",AUDI,"{  ""car-model"": ""Audi RS3"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""sporty"", ""powerful"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""singleframe"", ""oval-shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""Matrix-LED""],    ""bumper"": [""lower part adorned with huge side scoops""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
AUDI S7 Sportback,"When you are undecided if you want a sporty wagon or a sedan, you can always choose a fastback-like sedan as the Audi S7. The frame-less side-windows, the sleek sloped back and the sporty style of this body has attracted a lot of fans. It has enough room inside for five people, a big trunk and a mean aggressive look. Compared with the S6 or S6 Avant, the S7 Sportback is lowered with 10 mm (0.39 in) compared with the A7 Sportback which already sits lower than the regular A6. Even though there is enough room for five adults, S7 has the rear bench arranged as a two-seater with a center console where nobody can sit on. The center console for the driver hosts the gear-lever, which looks like a throttle from a speed-boat. All in all, the 2019 Audi S7 Sportback is a fast car with a proper fast look compared with its siblings the S6 and S6 Avant, which are better for those who wants to go unnoticed. For the U.S. market, the 2019 Audi S7 is fitted with a gasoline TFSI engine V6. Its 2.9-liter mill makes due with an electric supercharger and a turbocharger, which push the power bar up to 450 HP and 600 Nm (442.5 lb-ft) of torque.

AUDI A7,"In 2017 Audi changed the first generation of its hatchback-coupe like four-door vehicle, the A7. The second generation carried over the key elements that made the first one sell in large numbers and made some new modifications for a better look and feel of the vehicle. Audi tried to make the A7 Sportback look like an athletic sculpture with a long engine hood, long wheelbase and short overhangs. Pronounced contours emphasize the wheels and reference Audi's genes, which determine the body's proportions. The A7 is 4969mm (16.3 ft) long, 1908 mm (6.3 ft) wide and 1422 mm (4.7 ft ) high. The wheelbase is quite big, at 2926 mm (9.6 ft). Inside, there is room for four adults, and the rear headroom is enough, but not vast. The digitalization of Audi interiors started with the A8 and continued in this generation of the A7. The frameless windows were carried over and they do look great in this fastback four-door coupe look. For propulsion, the 2017 A7 uses a mild-hybrid V6 unit. Based on a 48-volt architecture, with a belt-driven starter-generator (BAS), the 3.0-liter gasoline TFSI (turbo with direct injection) engine offers 350 hp and 500 Nm (368.8 lb-ft) of torque. The power is sent to the all-wheel-drive quattro system via a 7-speed S-Tronic gearbox (Dual-clutch technology) and the performance is up to the A7's aggressive look. The 0-100 kph (0-62 mph) sprint is done in 5.4 seconds and the maximum speed is limited to 250 kph (155 mph).

AUDI A8,"Audi refreshed the fourth generation of the A8 in 2021, and there were more than just a few exterior and interior details in it. In 1994, Audi decided to attack its main competitors BMW and Mercedes-Benz, in the upper premium segment and introduced the A8. The constant evolution of the German limousine gave it a seat at the table of executive limousines. That trend continued to the fourth generation, which Audi introduced in 2017. Despite the world pandemic that shattered the world in 2020, the carmaker kept its promise and refreshed its flagship four years after the initial launch. One of the most striking features of the 2022 A8 was the front fascia. The big, hexagonal, singleframe grille featured black and piano-black fins and a chromed rim. In addition, a pair of standard Matrix-LED headlights with an option for digital-LED ensured an optimum driving light. From the sides, the 2022 A8 showed new side sills, carried over from the S8, which emphasized the car's dynamic character. Another premiere for the 2022 model year was the introduction of the S-Line package, which became available. It replaced the shiny chromed grille with a darker one and added a few other exterior details. Inside, the A8 was as comfortable as a German limousine could be. Seats with up to 18 cushions provided various massage functions. A set of 10.1 HD TVs could provide entertainment for the rear seat passengers while the discreet Matrix-LED ensured a discreet or brighter illumination. At the front, the carmaker removed any gauges with displays. The Audi Virtual Cockpit replaced the analog dials in the dashboard, while on the center stack, the infotainment display and an additional control panel with a haptic touchscreen provided further controls for the MMI, climate controls, or driving options.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""A8"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""elegant"", ""sophisticated"", ""dynamic"", ""comfortable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""big"", ""hexagonal"", ""singleframe"", ""black"", ""piano-black"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""Matrix-LED"", ""digital-LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
AUDI S5,"Sophisticated, a real head-turner with a classy-sporty design, powerful and refined are the words the describe the 2016 Audi S5. Available in coupe or a convertible body style, both versions were offered with two trim levels: Premium Plus and Prestige. While the Premium Plus offered lots of comfort equipment such as tri-zone automatic climate control, heated power front sport seats and driver memory functions, it lacked one of the most desired feature, Bluetooth audio streaming. With the S5 being around for quite some time, it still kept the Audi’s proprietary digital music interface that became a bit dated. Bluetooth audio could be added with the optional Technology package for extra cost. Other features with the base model included 18-inch alloys, xenon headlights, LED running lights and LED running stoplights, keyless entry and keyless go, driver memory functions, a premium Bang & Olufsen audio system, Bluetooth connectivity and a 6.5-inch display. Stepping up to the top-of-the-range, the Prestige trim level added adaptive headlights and included the Technology package that came with Bluetooth streaming audio, a navigation system, a larger display, front and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera and a blin-spot monitoring system. Many other features were bundled into packages such as the Driver Assistance package, the Black Optic package and the Comfort package.

AUDI S3,"In April 2016, Audi introduced the refreshed A3 lineup, and, along with the rest of the range, the German carmaker upgraded the S3 as well. Since the beginning, it was one of the hottest hot-hatches on the market, and it provided an all-wheel-drive system. Over time, while the A3 range evolved, the S3 was constantly upgraded. The third generation of the A3 was refreshed in 2016 and, two decades after the first generation. The S3 was offered in four body versions: hatchback with 3- or 5-doors, cabriolet, and sedan. A new front fascia was introduced, with a taller single-frame grille between the standard full-LED headlights. There were a pair of air-scoops to cool the brakes on the sides, and those were not only for show. The S3 showed the S-logo from the brake-calipers through the 18” light-alloy wheels with a unique design. A discrete roof-spoiler was on top of the tailgate (for the hatchback versions), and four, not so discrete, exhausts were shown under the bumper. Inside, the S3 featured S-logos on the flat-bottom steering wheel, the door-sills, seats, and gearstick. Two bucket seats in the front offered good support on the corners. Depending on the options, the instrument cluster could feature the Audi Virtual Cockpit digital display. The MMI (Multi Media Interface) infotainment unit was fitted as standard. Despite not having complaints about the 300 hp engine offered on its predecessor, the 2016 S3 offered 10 hp more. It was mated as standard with a 6-speed manual for the 3-door hatchback. In selected markets, such as the U.K., the 5-door version and the sedan came equipped with a 7-speed automatic (dual-clutch) S-Tronic gearbox.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Audi S3"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""sporty"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""taller"", ""single-frame""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""full-LED""],    ""bumper"": [""air-scoops"", ""exhausts""],    ""wheel"": [""18” light-alloy"", ""unique design""],    ""doors"": [""3- or 5-doors""],    ""roof"": [""discrete spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof-spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": [""four exhausts""]  }}```"
AUDI S3 Cabriolet,"Audi introduced a mid-life cycle refresh for the A3 range in 2016, and, along with the rest of the range, it improved the S3 as well. The convertible market was not big in 2016, but it was essential to a brand image, and Audi knew that. With its image still affected by Dieselgate, it tried to show its good side with sportier vehicles that could attract more people and distract them from the scandal. The S3 Cabriolet was a smart way to do that: it offered a good image, plenty of power, and a premium feel. Audi introduced new headlights with LED signature daytime running lights inside the MATRIX-LED headlamps along with the facelifted version. Their sharp design with angular lines stood on the sides of the massive, singleframe grille. Like any of the S-specific models, the S3 Cabriolet featured silver A-pillars and door-mirrors caps. In the back, the double, twin-exhausts with oval tips confirmed the car's special status. The carmaker installed standard 18"" light-alloy wheels, with an option for 19"". Inside, the S3 Cabriolet featured a 2+2 interior, with limited legroom for the rear passengers due to its 2.6 m (102.2"") wheelbase. The flat-bottom steering wheel sported the red and gray S-logo. Its front sport-bucket seats with high bolstering were upholstered in leather as standard, with an option for heating and ventilation. Audi installed a new infotainment unit with a 7"" screen that popped-up from the dashboard. Audi installed the same 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline engine from the rest of the S3 range under the hood. It provided plenty of power for the compact convertible, and its all-wheel-drive system was fitted as standard.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""A3 S3 Cabriolet"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""premium"", ""sharp"", ""angular"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""angular""],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""singleframe""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""sharp""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""18-inch"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [""silver A-pillars"", ""door-mirrors caps""],    ""roof"": [""convertible""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""double"", ""twin"", ""oval""]  }}```"
AUDI A4 Allroad,"After ten years of off-roading experience with the first model, Audi released the facelift version of the second generation A4 Allroad Quattro in 2019. Inheriting Audi A4 Avant's practical spirit and comfort, the car has some off-road oriented modifications that form a vehicle that performs well on and off the road. The wagon is propelled by a 2.0-liter TFSI engine paired with a seven-speed S tronic automatic transmission and provides a considerable power output while still averaging a relatively small fuel consumption. Thanks to a Quattro drive system, the power is distributed to all the wheels. Besides the widening of the track, the A4 Allroad Quattro also benefits from increased ground clearance. The raised ride height and the larger wheels make this model stand 1.4 inches (35 mm) higher than the Avant version. There is also an optional suspension with damper control managed by the Electronic Chassis Platform (ECP). Audi adjusted the exterior design to provide a more robust look to differentiate the Allroad Quattro from the Avant and highlight its off-road capabilities. These design features include the front and rear bumpers, wide wheel arch trims, and side sill, all in a color called Structured gray. Optionally, the German automaker offers them in Manhattan gray or in the body color, with silver inlays available for the sills. The underbody protection shines in silver, while the diffuser insert is finished in matte black to provide some contrast. The look is completed by the raised roof rails that provide increased practicality as they enable cargo to be loaded onto the roof. The interior design is identical to the Avant version as it can be equipped with Basic, Design Selection, and S Line package lines. Audi chose to remain with the same interior as it has increased quality and can provide enough comfort even in off-road conditions. To provide a versatile driving experience, the car lets the driver select from profiles such as Comfort, Auto, Dynamic, Efficiency, Individual, and Offroad. Choosing the Offroad profile converts all the systems to an off-road mode and combines functions like traction control, stabilization control, ABS, and hill descent control. The electrically operated tailgate is marked with an ""allroad"" logo to provide a distinctive look for the car's rear end. It reveals a trunk with a capacity of 17.5 cubic feet (495 liters). Optionally, the Audi can be equipped with sensor control, a swivel trailer hitch, a folding mat, and a load-securing kit with a rail system to increase functionality. On the road, the Audi A4 Allroad Quatro is a wagon that can offer much comfort and stability while having increased space for passengers and cargo. It can perform well off the road and is built to turn from a family car into an off-road vehicle quickly.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""A4 Allroad Quattro"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""Wagon"",  ""overall-design"": [""Practical"", ""Robust"", ""Off-road oriented"", ""Distinctive"", ""Comfortable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""Front and rear bumpers"", ""Wide wheel arch trims"", ""Side sill""],    ""wheel"": [""Larger wheels""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""Raised roof rails""],    ""diffusor"": [""Matte black diffuser insert""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
AUDI A5,"After winning the hearts of the customers in 2007 with the first generation of the A5 and after 9 years of proved success, Audi decided it was time for a new generation. The timeless design of the A5 along with the great luxury and the comfort features of an A4 made the A5 one of the user’s top choices. In the standard version, the A5 lacked a bluetooth audio connectivity and a USB port. Safety-wise, it did not offer as much as the competitors did, the coupe offering only a blind-spot monitor. While the competitor’s cars were more expensive than the luxurious 2-door car, they did offer more technology. Despite the downsides, the A5 was still an attractive car that came with a standard all-wheel-drive and a well designed suspension. Besides the coupe, Audi also released the convertible version of the A5, a car that was equipped with a power-operated soft top. The A5 was available with 2 trim levels: the Premium and the Premium Plus. The base level came with standard 188-inch alloys, automatic headlights, LED running lights, automatic wipers, heated mirrors, a tilt-only sunroof, leather upholstery and other great features. The Premium Plus added features such as auto-dimming mirrors, keyless entry and go and a high quality Bang & Olufsen 14-speaker audio system for the coupe. Users could add a sport package to the Premium Plus trim level and it consisted of front sport seats, a sport flat-bottomed steering wheel along with the Audi’s Drive Select system (calibrations for the steering, throttle and automatic transmission).",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""A5"",  ""year"": ""2007"",  ""size"": ""2-door"",  ""overall-design"": [""timeless"", ""luxurious"", ""attractive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""automatic""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""188-inch alloys""],    ""doors"": [""2-door""],    ""roof"": [""tilt-only sunroof"", ""power-operated soft top""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
AUDI A3 Cabriolet,"After three years on the market, Audi introduced a facelifted version for its compact-segment contender, the A3, and the Cabriolet version received more features. There was an increased demand for convertibles and, even though it wasn't a big market, it was essential to a brand image, especially for a premium carmaker. With its image still damaged by the Dieselgate, Audi tried to make a good impression and revived the A3 lineup introducing cleaner engines. Audi installed new LED signature daytime running lights inside the standard Xenon headlights. The Matrix LED headlamps were offered as an option for the first time in the A3 lineup. Their sharp design with angular lines stood on the sides of the massive, singleframe grille. Its body-colored door-mirrors were offered as silver on the S-line package. In the back, the twin-exhausts with round tips completed the car's premium status. Inside, the A3 Cabriolet featured a 2+2 interior, with limited legroom for the rear passengers due to its 2.6 m (102.2"") wheelbase. There was a new MMI (Multi Media Infotainment) unit with a 7"" screen that popped-up from the dashboard. Depending on the options, the A3 offered a cloth or leather-clad interior. The carmaker installed a wide choice of powertrains for the A3 Cabriolet. It started with a 116 hp 1.4-liter gasoline engine and went all the way up to a 190 hp 2.0-liter TFSI unit. Despite the Dieselgate scandal, Audi offered two turbo-diesel versions for the A3 Cabriolet.

AUDI R8 GT,"Ten years after the introduction of the original R8 GT, Audi launched a limited series of just 150 units for the 2023 Audi R8 GT, demonstrating its ability to transfer technologies from motorsports to production vehicles. The 2023 Audi R8 GT was built as a limited 333 units worldwide, but U.S. customers were granted almost half of them. It was Audi's way of saying ""thank you"" for the important sales performed on the American continent, and the car was particular indeed. For starters, it featured the mighty naturally-aspirated 5.2-liter V10 but pumped up to provide more power than the regular R8 V10. Since it was a limited-series vehicle, it boasted a few distinctive elements inspired by Audi's racing cars that shined in LMS. Thus, the carbon-fiber elements such as the front splitter, flics, side skirt covers, cW-elements on the sides of the rear bumper, and the rear diffuser adorned the car. In addition, a gooseneck-type wing at the back added more aerodynamic pressure to the rear wheels. Last but not least, the 2023 R8 GT was available in just three colors: Tango Red Metallic, Daytona Gray Metallic, and Mythos Black metallic. Inside, the cockpit featured an Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel, while the seats sported leather and Dinamica materials. In addition, the Bang & Olufsen sound system sent the sound waves through speakers installed in the seatbacks. Audi limited the interior colors to just two: red and black. At least, it placed a sequential numbering matted in carbon inlay near the gear selector. For the technical part, Audi installed many good parts in the car, such as CFRP anti-roll bars, ceramic brakes, and 20"" 10-spoke forged wheels wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""R8 GT"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""limited-series"", ""distinctive"", ""aerodynamic"", ""sporty"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""carbon-fiber"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""wheel"": [""10-spoke"", ""forged""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""carbon-fiber"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""spoiler"": [""gooseneck-type"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""exhaust"": [""powerful"", ""sporty""]  }}```"
AUDI A5 Cabriolet,"The 2012 Audi A5 Cabriolet was the open-top version of the A5 Coupe. It was unveiled at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show and it wasn't a completely new model, but a mid-life refresh. After a long time when Audi didn't offer too much for the open-top car segment, it started to recover offering more than ever: the TT Roadster, A3 Cabriolet, A5 Cabriolet, and the R8 were built for every taste and more budgets. The A5 Cabriolet, though, was the only one that featured four real seats, unlike the A3 which offered a very small room on the back seats. The refreshed design included the LED daytime running lights inside the headlights, a redesigned grille and front bumper with pronounced air inlets. On the side, it was the same vehicle, with panels from the coupe. In the rear, there was an option for new, LED light strips for the taillamps. Inside, there was a button used to adjust the optional seat heating and ventilation in three stages. The selector for the automatic transmission was redesigned. The buttons on the steering wheel were redesigned as well. All displays were illuminated in white. For thermal comfort, warm air was blown to the neck of the front occupants. Under the hood, engines were ranging from a four-pot 1.8-liter TFSI up to the 4.2-liter RS5 version. There were four TDI versions and three TFSI engines offered, mated to a manual or automatic transmission, with front or all-wheel-drive, depending on the engine.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""A5 Cabriolet"",  ""year"": ""2012"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""open-top"", ""four-seater"", ""LED lights"", ""revised interior""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""open-top""],    ""grille"": [""redesigned""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""daytime running""],    ""bumper"": [""pronounced air inlets""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""revised interior""],    ""roof"": [""open-top""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
AUDI Q8 Sportback,"Audi didn't waste its time when it introduced the 2022 Q8 and unveiled a sportier-looking version as well, named the Q8 Sportback e-tron. Apart from the SUV-shaped Q8 e-tron, the German automaker also introduced the Sportback, which was almost the same car but with a different shape. Moreover, this version targeted customers that didn't need that much trunk space and were mostly focused on the vehicle's look. Like its Q8 e-tron sibling, the Sportback featured a similar front fascia with the same signature light. Yet, the side scoops on the lower bumper were taller. But the most significant difference was on the side, where the roof sported a sloped-down shape towards the raked-forward tailgate. Moreover, the carmaker added a lip spoiler on the trunk's edge. Inside, the Q8 e-tron boasted a luxurious cabin covered with Dynamica microfiber made from recycled materials. At the front, the carmaker installed bolstered seats for the entire range, with an option for leather-wrapped sports seats. Like any other high-tech vehicle from its era, the Q8 e-tron featured a digital instrument panel. At the same time, on the center stack, the carmaker added two touch screens for the MMI infotainment system. The upper one boasted a 10.1"" diagonal, while the lower one was of 8.6-inches. But the most significant difference was for the rear seats, where the headroom was smaller than on the regular Q8 e-tron. Moreover, the Sportsback's trunk offered just 528 liters (18.6 cu-ft) of space instead of the 569 liters (20 cu-ft) provided by its sibling. In addition, the frunk added 62 liters (2.2 cu-ft) of storage. The drivetrain consisted of a dual-motor system that provided 300 kW (402 HP) and 664 Nm (490 lb-ft) of torque sent in all corners.

AUDI e-tron GT,"The electric revolution forced Audi to introduce new vehicles on the market, such as the 2021 e-tron lineup, which showed no mercy for its competitors. Porsche stunned the world with the Taycan, and Audi tried to impress it with the e-Tron SUV, but its success was smaller than expected. That didn't make them quit and tried again, in 2021, with the e-tron GT, a sports sedan that could beat most supercars at their own game, as long as the game was on a quarter-mile run or not too many laps of the infamous Nurburgring Nordschleife race-track. The e-tron GT was wider and lower than the Audi A7 and looked much better. Its headlights featured the already known Audi signature lamps and the big singleframe grille. In this case, it wasn't needed to cool the engine since there was none inside. There were only a few vents to cool the batteries. From the sides, despite the coupe-like profile, it was a four-door sedan with a very sloped rear end. In the rear, a red LED strip stretched from one side to another. It worth mentioning the standard carbon-fiber roof, which could have been traded for a panoramic glass roof. On the trunk-lid, Audi installed a pop-out spoiler that was deployed over 50 mph (80 kph). Inside, Audi installed a cockpit that resembled a race-car idea, with the driver isolated by the rest of the car with a tall center console and a tilted center stack. There were no analog dials or gauges everywhere. There was a TFT display with the Audi Virtual Cockpit in front of the driver, while on the center stack, the MMI display surrounded by a piano-black trim took center stage. Like most of the four-doors coupe on the market, Audi installed a pair of seats in the back with low-mounted seats to accommodate average-sized passengers. Audi installed a 175 kW (238 hp) electric motor on the front axle and a 320 kW (435 hp) in the back. They worked separately or combined to provide maximum traction and safety.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""e-tron GT"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""wider, lower"",  ""overall-design"": [""impressive"", ""sporty"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""aggressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""big"", ""singleframe""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""Audi signature"", ""lamps""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""four-door"", ""coupe-like""],    ""roof"": [""carbon-fiber"", ""panoramic glass""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""pop-out"", ""deployable""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
AUDI Q4 Sportback,"After two years since the unveiling of the Q4 and Q4 Sportback concept cars, Audi unveiled the production versions of its new all-electric compact SUV. While the regular Q4 was a classic-shaped SUV, the Sportback version was designed for the SUV-coupe segment. Audi addressed the car more for those searching for a different mix—a vehicle big enough for a family, with a sporty look, and low running costs. The Q4 e-tron Sportback had them all and something more. With its 86 cm (33.9"") long front overhang, the Q4 e-tron Sportback changed the way an SUV was built. The designers could make that happened since there was no need for thick and big radiators. Its front fascia featured LED or Matrix-LED headlights, depending on the options. With its sloped tailgate, the Q4 Sportback offered an incredibly low aerodynamic coefficient of just 0.26. Its sculptured side panels and big wheels increased the car's aggressive look. Inside, the carmaker made a bold move and created a unique design for the Q4, with the center stack and the infotainment screen tilted toward the driver. There were no analog dials anywhere. In the instrument cluster, Audi introduced the Virtual Cockpit, used for several years on other products. To show its commitment toward sustainable production, Audi built the front seats with recycled materials. It used about 26 1.5-liter PET bottles for each seat. In the back, the carmaker installed a 40/20/40 split-folding bench, which could increase the trunk size from 535 liters (18.9 cu-ft) to 1,460 liters (51.6 cu-ft). A Audi offered the Q4 e-tron with two battery variants and three drivetrains. For the base level, the carmaker provided a rear-wheel-drive Q35 version with a 55 kWh battery pack and the 82 kWh battery pack for the Q40 and Q50 all-wheel-drive, respectively. The rear-wheel-drive Q40 offered the highest range of up to 520 km (323.1 miles).",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Q4 e-tron Sportback"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""compact SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""classic-shaped"", ""sporty"", ""aggressive"", ""sustainable"", ""aerodynamic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""front"", ""big""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""Matrix-LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""big""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
AUDI Q4 e-tron,"With an increased demand for electric vehicles, Audi announced in 2019 the launch of the Q4 and Q4 Sportback when it unveiled the concept cars. It took another two years to introduce the production versions. While it wasn't the first electric car offered by the German carmaker, it was the first compact SUV in its lineup. The Q4 showed a new language into Audi's design language. The designers could shorten the front overhang since the car didn't need a long front area anymore due to smaller radiators. Still, they required an adequate length for the crumple zones. Its front fascia featured LED or, as an option, Matrix-LED headlights. The muscular SUV showed a cab-rearward styling with a raked windshield and a raked-forward rear windscreen. The blackened B- and C-pillars and the wide D-pillars showed a hatchback cabin design. Inside, the carmaker made a bold move and created a unique design for the Q4, with the center stack and the infotainment screen tilted toward the driver. There were no analog dials anywhere.

AUDI SQ5 Sportback,"Audi made a name for itself for its high-performance turbodiesel engines. It used them to conquer the LeMans race and proved them worthy on many street vehicles. For the 2021 model-year, the German carmaker offered the Q5 with a diesel-fueled engine that could blast to 100 kph (62 mph) in just 5.1 seconds and named it SQ5 Sportback. A 4-door SUV coupe ready to hit the roads with the same confidence as the hottest hot-hatch available to its release time, in late 2020. The SQ5 Sportback featured a sloped roof and rear window. Its shape was closer to the Porsche Cayenne Coupe than to the Audi A5 Sportback, but since both brands are in the same boat, nobody complained about that. Unlike its non-S sibling, the SQ5 Sportback featured a bigger singleframe grille at the front and silver accents on the lower splitter and side-scoops. Audi hid the exhausts under the bumper in the rear, and, thankfully, it didn't install fake chromed exhausts. Inside, the clean lines were disrupted by the infotainment screen placed on top of the center stack on the dashboard. As usual, for the SQ trim levels, there were no analog dials on the instrument cluster. The Audi Virtual Cockpit TFT display replaced those. Audi installed two profiled seats on the bench in the back, but it could accommodate three occupants. Audi SQ5 featured a lowered suspension for improved cornering speed and was fitted as standard with 20"" light-alloy wheels. A set of 21"" was available as an option. For the powertrain, the SQ5 featured a twin-turbo V6 diesel engine with the turbochargers installed between the cylinder banks.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""SQ5 Sportback"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""4-door SUV coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""high-performance"", ""sloped roof"", ""clean lines"", ""sporty"", ""aggressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""bigger"", ""singleframe""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""silver accents"", ""hidden exhausts""],    ""wheel"": [""20\"" light-alloy"", ""21\"" available""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""hidden""]  }}```"
AUDI Q5 Sportback,"Audi introduced the second generation of the compact-size SUV Q5 in 2017 on the same MLB Evo platform shared with the Porsche Macan. Three years later, the German car-maker unveiled the facelift for it. While the European customers started to move away from the MPV segment toward the SUV segment, Audi understood that it could do a lot more on the market. At first, the German car-company from Ingolstadt introduced the Q7 in 2006, and after just two years, it brought the smaller Q5, which was launched into battle in the premium segment. The 2021 model year was the facelifted version for the second generation, which brought a refreshed image and better amenities. From the outside, the 2021 Q5 featured LED headlights and, as an option, matrix-design LED technology. A pair of large air intakes flanked the Singleframe grille. On the sides, the new sills brought a roughness appearance to the compact-sized SUV. In the back, Audi introduced the OLED technology option, which could offer different light signatures for the car. Inside, Audi offered the 2021 Q5 with a standard rear bench plus, configured for a different seatback angle. It could also slide forward to increase the trunk space. The power tailgate is standard, and it could be opened with a simple foot gesture, with the car's key in the pocket. For the infotainment system, the 2021 Q5 featured the MIB3 unit. The MMI navigation was equipped with a 10.1"" touch-screen display on the center stack. The Bang & Olufsen sound system was offered as an option. Audi installed a new, 2.0-liter TFSI engine under the hood. It was helped by a mild-hybrid system and paired to a 7-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox.

AUDI e-tron,"The e-tron was the first fully electric car built by Audi. It was shown as a concept car at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show. The first cars were delivered in 2019. In the quest for green motoring, some car-makers build their electric vehicles to look like a statement. Tesla Model-X or Jaguar E-Pace were designed to look different. On the other hand, the e-tron took a different path. It was built on an existing platform in a shape that was already known for customers who didn't want to prove anything special. The front fascia of the e-tron was dominated by the big singleframe grille. Even though electric cars need cooling for the motors and the batteries, they don't need the same big radiators. But the singleframe was still in place. It was painted in titanium-gray, which became a trademark for Audi's electrified models. On the sides, the car featured an option for two slim side-arms for rear-view cameras, instead of rear-view mirrors. The e-tron was equipped with a full LED light system for headlights and taillights. Inside, the e-tron offered only seating for five. It featured only digital displays for the instrument cluster, infotainment system, and two smaller screens on the doors for the rear-view cameras. It featured Valcona leather seats and natural wood inserts in the cabin, to enhance the luxury experience. The e-tron featured two electric motors, one for the front and one for the rear axle. The 95kWh and 700 kg (1543 lbs) battery pack was placed between the axles, in the floor. It was available with either a 120 kW charging system or 150 kW, while a standard 9.6 kW AC (11 kW AC for Europe) capsule charger was provided and designed to deliver a fresh charge overnight.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""e-tron"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""mid-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""efficient""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sleek""],    ""grille"": [""big"", ""singleframe"", ""titanium-gray""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""full LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""digital displays"", ""Valcona leather"", ""natural wood inserts""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""electric""]  }}```"
AUDI SQ8 e-tron,"Whenever an S-letter preceded a nameplate on an Audi, customers knew there was something special about it, and the 2022 SQ8 e-tron was no different. Audi unveiled the Q8 e-tron lineup in late 2022, replacing the former e-tron model that has been on the market since 2018. Yet, it was more than just a rename; it was a new era that defined the future of the German premium automaker. With the SQ8 e-tron version, Audi promised its customers that the performance part won't be left behind. Sporting an aggressive stance, with a lowered bodywork than its regular Q8 e-tron sibling. Its front fascia featured the same LED signature light that emphasized the car's width. In addition, the 3D grille sported a stylized honeycomb pattern. The side scoops in the lower bumper showed the same four slats design as the DRLs from the lower side of the headlights. From its profile, the flared wheel arches, the 22"" alloy wheels, and the side skirts created an even sportier look for the German crossover. Inside, Audi used recycled materials for the seats and the Dynamica microfiber door cards, with an option for a leather-wrapped interior. Still, customers were delighted with the luxurious amenities offered by Audi, regardless of their choice. The instrument panel was a TFT display fronting the driver. At the same time, on the center stack, the carmaker added two touch-screens for the MMI infotainment system. The upper one boasted a 10.1"" diagonal, while the lower one was of 8.6-inches. Like the regular Q8 e-tron, the SQ8 e-tron featured a 40/20/40 split-folding bench in the rear for three passengers. Apart from the rear trunk, the carmaker created a storage compartment under the hood, the so-called ""frunk."" Unlike its regular Q8 e-tron siblings, the SQ8 version fitted with a three-motor setup: one at the front and two at the rear axle.

AUDI Q8 e-tron,"Unveiled in late 2022, the Q8 e-tron was the natural evolution after the e-tron model was introduced in 2018, but it was more than just a re-branding move. Audi sold more than 150,000 units of the original e-tron model, and thanks to the feedback received from its customers, it managed to create an even better vehicle: the Q8 e-tron. The standard Q8 e-tron was built as a crossover vehicle with a shape that resembled the former e-tron. Yet, at the front, a new signature light combined the DRLs inside the headlights with a new light strip placed under the hood's edge. The singleframe grille was reimagined and available in black or aluminum color. Audi placed the side scoops on the lower bumper that deflected the air on the sides. From its profile, the sculptured doors channeled the air towards the back of the vehicle to reduce the drag. Finally, an LED light stripe at the back resembled the signature lights at the front, but in red. Under the rear bumper, the carmaker installed a four-slat diffuser. Inside, the Q8 e-tron boasted a luxurious cabin covered with Dynamica microfiber made from recycled materials. At the front, the carmaker installed bolstered seats for the entire range, with an option for leather-wrapped sports seats. Like any other high-tech vehicle from its era, the Q8 e-tron featured a digital instrument panel. Atop the center stack, the carmaker added the screen for the MMI infotainment unit, and underneath it, a touchscreen for climate control and other vehicle features.

AUDI Q3 Sportback,"The first Q3 was released to the public in 2018 and since then over 1,1 million units were sold worldwide. More expensive than the Q3, the Q3 Sportback was built on the same platform as its twin brother, the Q3, however, the roofline was lowered by 3 cm and its length was increased by 1,5 cm. The exterior designed was refreshed with a new bumper, a fake rear diffuser and new exhaust. From the side, the Q3 Sportback looked a bit like the Bentley Bentayga due to the lines on the back continued to the side. The front of the coupe SUV was different as the grille was refreshed. The interior remained pretty much the one we already knew from the previous Q3 model.  The interior design of the Q3 Sportback was rather unconventional with a dashboard wrapped up in Alcantara leather, as well as the door panels. In contrast, some of the materials used look cheap for an Audi. The S-line version came with partial leather seats, aluminum trims and pedals and a new steering wheel. A large central infotainment system was available, with in-built sat-nav and other features such as Apple Car Play and Android auto.

AUDI RS Q8,"Audi introduced the most powerful version of the Q8 in 2019 at the Los Angeles Auto Show and bragged about setting a lap record around the famous Nurburgring racetrack. With an increased demand for high-performance SUVs, Audi couldn’t sit tight and hope for the best. So, after launching the Q8 as an SUV-Coupe in 2018 and offering it with an S version that raised its power up to 507 PS (500 hp), the four-rings brand shook the market in 2019 when it unveiled the 600 PS (592 hp) RS Q8, which was available exclusively powered by a turbocharged gasoline engine, unlike the S Q8 that was made in two versions: a gas-powered and a turbo-diesel. But the most important part of the RS Q8 was that, underneath its skin, the RS Q8 was a Lamborghini Urus, but with less power. Audi was no stranger to SUVs and all-wheel drive systems. It was also known for creating several other potent SUVs, so the RS Q8 wasn’t exactly a surprise for them. But the car couldn’t look just like the S Q8; it had to be meaner. As a result, it featured a much more aggressive front fascia fitted with a wide single-frame grille finished in piano black. The automaker offered the RS Q8 with standard Matrix LED headlights featuring tri-dimensional daytime running lights. Their design was mimicked on the taillights. Since the car had a wider track than the regular Q8, its stance was already more aggressive, and thanks to the adaptive air suspension, it could be lowered to decrease ground effect. From its profile, the black door mirror caps and pillars emphasized the coupe-like shape of the greenhouse. Finally, at the back, the automaker installed two wide oval exhausts on the sides that flanked a diffuser placed underneath the bumper. Inside, the automaker created a luxurious cabin with sports bucket seats at the front and a bench profiled for two in the rear. These were covered in Valcona leather with a honeycomb pattern and RS embossing on the seatbacks. The driver fronted the already-known Audi Virtual Cockpit instrument cluster that could show more info about performance, navigation, and engine parameters. In addition, the automaker installed on the center stack its top-of-the-line MMI (Man-Machine-Interface) infotainment unit. But the most significant changes compared to the rest of the Audi Q8 range happened under the skin. Audi had increased the front and rear tracks increased over the standard Q8 by 120 mm (4.7”) and 458 mm (18”), respectively. In addition, it fitted the car with wider tires and 22” light-alloy wheels. The 4.0-liter twin-turbo hot-turbocharged V8 engine produced just 50 ponies (49 hp) less than the Urus. As a result, it was just 0.1-second slower on the 0 to 60 mph (0-97 kph) run than its Italian sibling. It was the most expensive RS-badged Audi.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Audi Q8"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""SUV-Coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""wide"", ""mean""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wide"", ""piano black""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""Matrix LED"", ""tri-dimensional""],    ""bumper"": [""diffuser""],    ""wheel"": [""22” light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [""black door mirror caps""],    ""roof"": [""coupe-like shape""],    ""diffusor"": [""wide"", ""underneath the bumper""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""wide oval""]  }}```"
AUDI e-tron Sportback,"Part of a multi-billion investment into battery powered vehicles, the Audi e-tron Sportback is Ingolstadt's second electric SUV and the second production model from its continuously expanding e-tron product line. Essentially, the model is a so-called ""four-door coupe"" version of the e-tron, which is a more traditional looking electric SUV. Coincidentally, the regular e-tron is already based on a more coupe-like SUV, the Audi Q8, but the e-tron Sportback takes that coupe-look even further. While the standard e-tron goes head-to-head with the Mercedes-Benz EQC and the BMW iX3, the Audi e-tron Sportback doesn't have a direct rival and is simply a more stylish alternative to any other electric SUV. The technical bits are largely identical between the two e-trons, but there are some performance and energy advantages on the Sportback's side thanks to its more aerodynamic exterior shape. In fact, the coupe-like body shape gives it a drag coefficient of just 0.25, almost as good as an aerodynamic sedan. Apparently, the improved aero alone gives the Sportback 10 km (6.2 miles) of more range compared to the normal e-tron. The sporty SUV has a range of up to 446 kilometers (277.1 miles) in the WLTP cycle, despite taking its electric juice from an identical, 95 kWh Lithium-ion battery.",AUDI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Audi e-tron Sportback"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""four-door coupe"", ""stylish"", ""aerodynamic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""coupe-like""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
AURUS Senat,"While the bigger Senat L700 limousine was built for the presidents and country rulers, the Senat S600 was made as a regular luxury sedan. With a new luxury brand of its own, the Russian oligarchs could ditch their S-Class and Rolls-Royces and take a proud, Russian luxury sedan. The carmaker promised that it would start production in 2020 and take orders from everyone who wants to have a vehicle designed for the State Duma (Russian Parliament). But the production was delayed once again and started in 2021. Yuri Chernenko finished its design after long debates and discussions with potential customers and a 24 professional designers jury. Even though it resembled a Rolls-Royce Ghost, the inspiration design was the 1945 ZIS-110, which was in turn inspired by a Packard. Its tall grille with vertical slats and the cab-rearward design and the sloped rear window was different than any other car designed and built in Russia or, before that, in the U.S.S.R. The LED headlights and taillights were developed by the NAMI, the State Research Institute of the Russian Federation. The interior featured a blend of leather and wood-trims in an exclusive Russian design theme. Its infotainment display sat at the same level with the TFT screen installed for the instrument panel and the entire dash panel. The center console sported the gear selector and the rotary knob for the infotainment unit. Aurus offered the option for either two individual seats or a bench profiled for two in the back.

BENTLEY Bentayga Speed,"The 2020 Bentley Bentayga Speed took the crown for the world's fastest SUV from its brother Lamborghini Urus by just a half of mile speed difference (0.8 kph). The Speed version for any Bentley was the faster one. So was the Bentayga, which received few updates so it can outrun the regular version and its brothers. The Urus, the Bentayga, and the Porsche Cayenne were built on the same platform. But not all of them had a W12 engine under the hood. For starters, the Bentayga Speed had a few details when compared to the standard version. Its front bumper and apron were different. To create a sporty look, the car featured dark-tinted headlights, side sills, and a longer roof-spoiler on top of the tailgate. Under the redesigned apron, the Bentayga Speed featured an Akrapovic exhaust. The “Speed” badge was shown on the front door panels. A unique design for the 22” light-alloy wheels was adopted to fit with the sportiest version of the Bentayga. Inside, there was a mix of luxury and sportiness. It looked like a grand-tourer SUV. The center stack was the home of the infotainment system and another 26 buttons and knobs. Next to the gear selector, there were some other buttons, just in case those 26 were not enough. A carbon-fiber trim was used for the dashboard and the rear center console. Under the hood, there was an upgraded version of the twin-turbo, 6.0-liter engine. It was upgraded by 26 hp over the regular model with the same engine.",BENTLEY,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Bentley Bentayga Speed"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxury"", ""sporty"", ""grand-tourer""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""redesigned""],    ""headlights"": [""dark-tinted""],    ""bumper"": [""different"", ""redesigned""],    ""wheel"": [""22-inch light-alloy"", ""unique design""],    ""doors"": [""featured 'Speed' badge""],    ""roof"": [""longer roof-spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""longer roof-spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": [""Akrapovic""]  }}```"
BENTLEY Bentayga,"Bentley introduced the fourth version for its SUV Bentayga in 2021, the S-version, which was tuned for spirited on-road driving without giving up its off-road abilities. The Bentayga shared its platform with the Porsche Cayenne and the Audi Q7, but it was built on a higher quality level and with much more expensive materials. Still, Bentley built it in its carbon-neutral factory from Crewe, in the U.K. Visually, there were quite a few differences between the regular Bentayga and the S-version. At the front, the carmaker installed smoked headlights and gloss-black lower bumpers. The trapezoidal lower grille at the front and the side scoops were also painted in black. On the sides, the carmaker added S-badges on the front doors. A new set of unique 22” light-alloy wheels enhanced the sporty appearance of the big SUV, while at the back, the lower black edge and the black split oval exhausts completed the aggressive image of the car. Inside, there was an enhanced interior with new, higher bolsters for the bucket seats and new pads on the door cards. The three-spoke steering wheel sported red stitching and aluminum trim on the lower side. A few S-badges were placed around the cabin, in front of the passenger, and inside the instrument panel. Under the hood, the carmaker installed a 4.0-liter twin-scroll turbocharged engine paired to an eight-speed automatic gearbox. A new active suspension system reacted faster to provide better cornering abilities, which worked together with the Electronic Stability Control and the Bentley Dynamic Ride system.",BENTLEY,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Bentayga"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""big SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""aggressive"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""trapezoidal"", ""smoked"", ""gloss-black""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""smoked""],    ""bumper"": [""gloss-black"", ""lower""],    ""wheel"": [""22” light-alloy"", ""unique""],    ""doors"": [""S-badges""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""black split oval""]  }}```"
BENTLEY Flying Spur,"Bentley released the new generation of its luxurious Flying Spur sedan in 2019. The British carmaker has added a ton of new technology in it, starting from the mild-hybrid 48-volt system and going through the infotainment system. On top of that, the flying B logo raises up from underneath the hood and is illuminated. Bentley is considered one of the most luxurious driver's cars in the world. Its goal is to make a top luxury vehicle but in supercar area of performance. In order to achieve this, Bentley engineers used the new W12-engine with 6.0-liters of displacement and twin-turbos, which results in 635 hp and 900 Nm (664 lb-ft) of torque. This unit is coupled to an 8-speed dual-clutch gearbox. The result is translated into a sum of great performances: 0-60 mph in 3.7 seconds (0-100 kph in 3.8 seconds) and a top speed of 207 mph (333 kph). Inside the new Bentley Flying Spur, the customers can choose between 16 colors of leather and wood veneer to match their personality. The modern side of the vehicle can be noticed on the Bentley Rotating Display, which can show either a wooden veneer, a 12.3 touch-screen display or three elegant round analog dials. On the outside, there are more refinement touches, which will show the value of the Bentley brand and its customers. Diamond-like LED Matrix headlights, a dark front grille and 22” wheels are just a few touches of luxury for the great, 2019 Flying Spur.",BENTLEY,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Flying Spur"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""modern"", ""refined"", ""elegant"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""dark""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""diamond-like"", ""LED"", ""Matrix""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""22-inch""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BENTLEY Continental GT,"Bentley introduced the third generation of the Continental GT in 2018 with two engine choices, but the Speed version came in 2021 with more power and more technologies. After Volkswagen took-over the Bentley brand, it transformed it into the fastest luxury brand globally and took a different path than its former partner, Rolls-Royce. With the Continental GT range, Bentley conquered the personal luxury coupe market. The 2021 Continental GT Speed featured similar styling to the rest of the range. The main difference was the black mesh-grille at the front, instead of the silver-metallic one from the regular Continental GT. On the sides, the car featured unique side sills and 22"" light-alloy wheels. Last but not least, a discreet ""Speed"" badge found its place on the front fenders. Inside, the GT Speed showcased Bentley's expertise in blending luxury materials with race-inspired ones, such as leather, Alcantara, and carbon-fiber. The carmaker created a unique design for the dashboard, and, in front of the passenger, it installed a ""Speed"" badge, which matched the one from the front fenders. Apart from the 24 hp increase over the standard Continental GT, the Speed offered more performance-oriented upgrades. The carmaker installed an electronic limited-slip differential, eLSD, for the rear axle that enhanced the traction. With these improvements, the GT Speed got the same 0-100 kph (0-62 mph) time as a Lamborghini Hurracan. For cornering speed, Bentley installed an active suspension system and four-wheel steering.",BENTLEY,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Continental GT"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""luxury"", ""race-inspired"", ""discreet"", ""unique"", ""performance-oriented""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black"", ""mesh""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""22-inch"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BENTLEY Continental GTC,"The third generation of the Bentley Continental GT was launched at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show. One year later, in November, the Convertible version was shown. It might seem strange to see an open-top vehicle launched when winter was coming (along with the 8th sequel of the Game of Thrones), but it was the right moment since the waiting period between order and delivery took just about enough for the car to be ready in the spring. The 2.5-ton vehicle was based on the GT model and shared the same platform with the Porsche Panamera. Compared to the previous generation, the 2018 GTC was lighter by around 80 kg (176 lbs) and more powerful. The 6.0-liter W12 engine was offered with more power, offering 635 hp, 60 hp more than before. The torque has been increased too, from 700 Nm (516.3 lb-ft) to 900 Nm (663.8 lb-ft). As a result, the 0-100 kph (0-62 mph) sprint was obtained in 3.8 seconds, which is supercar territory. But the GTC was an open-top Granturismo, built for relaxed driving. It doesn't have a big trunk. The interior features are top quality, with beautifully crafted leather, custom stitches with designated colors. But the feature that attracts the biggest applause was the Bentley Rotating Display in the middle of the dashboard, which is like in a 007 movie when at a touch of a button a panel rotates and reveals a 12.3” touch-screen, and on the other side there are three analog dials.",BENTLEY,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Bentley Continental GT"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""2.5-ton"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""powerful"", ""sleek"", ""elegant"", ""refined""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""curved"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""grille"": [""bold"", ""iconic""],    ""hood"": [""streamlined"", ""sculpted""],    ""headlights"": [""sleek"", ""modern""],    ""bumper"": [""low-profile"", ""integrated""],    ""wheel"": [""stylish"", ""large""],    ""doors"": [""luxurious"", ""solid""],    ""roof"": [""retractable"", ""sophisticated""],    ""diffusor"": [""aerodynamic"", ""functional""],    ""spoiler"": [""subtle"", ""aesthetic""],    ""exhaust"": [""dual"", ""polished""]  }}```"
BENTLEY Mulsanne,"A perfect example of mega-luxury obtained by perfectly blending retro styling cues with modern amenities, the Bentley Mulsanne was the perfect choice for customers looking for opulence. With a hand-made interior crafted with high care and a sculpted exterior, the large sedan had very few rivals on the market, such as the Rolls Royce’s Phantom or the Mercedes’ Maybach S600. The large luxury sedan offered seating for five and was available in two trim levels, the base and the Speed. The Mulsanne in the base trim level was well equipped and included 20-inch alloys, bi-xenon headlights, heated and auto dimming mirrors, parking sensors, soft-close doors, a sunroof and an air-ride suspension. The interior was fitted with leather upholstery, wood accents, heated front seats, automatic climate control, rear window privacy screens, an 8-inch touchscreen and Bluetooth Connectivity. Moving to the Speed trim level, the Mulsanne was equipped with a more powerful engine and included 21-inch alloys, selectable drive modes and the Mulliner packaged that could also be added to the base level. The Mullinger Package included a tweaked suspension, diamond-quilted upholstery, a leather headliner and metal sports pedals. An extensive list of stand-alone options included adaptive cruise control, a heated steering wheel, a refrigerated bottle cooler, lots of exterior and interior color choices as well as a customer color palette for an extra fee.",BENTLEY,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Bentley Mulsanne"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""large luxury sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""retro styling cues"", ""modern amenities"", ""sculpted exterior"", ""hand-made interior"", ""opulence""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""retro"", ""luxurious""],    ""hood"": [""sculpted""],    ""headlights"": [""bi-xenon""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""20-inch alloys"", ""21-inch alloys""],    ""doors"": [""soft-close""],    ""roof"": [""sunroof""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BENTLEY Mulliner,"Bentley unveiled the 18-unit limited series Batur as a grand touring coupe at the 2022 Monterey Car Week, and it was the most powerful vehicle ever built by the British brand. The car manufacturer chose a different way of saying ""goodbye"" to the W12 turbocharged powerplant that moved Bentleys for about two decades. The Batur was based on the Continental GT, but it was built by the automaker's bespoke Mulliner division. The exterior kind of resembled the shapes of a Continental GT in terms of proportions, but the details made it look completely different. At the front, the V-shaped grille resembled a boat's bow, and it was flanked on the upper side by a pair of swept-back headlights. In addition, on the lower side of the bumper and on the sides, there were additional cooling areas, which were all functional. The hood, which resembled the one from the Bacalar, featured a center spine and a pair of exhaust vents placed on the front side. The Batur's profile showed a set of exhaust vents on the doors, while the greenhouse featured a sloped-down line towards the back of the coupe. Inside, Bentley not only created a luxurious, leather-clad interior, but it also added some 18-karat gold trims around the cabin, including on the drive-select dial. There were a pair of bolstered seats at the front and a bench for two in the back. Under the hood stood a hand-built, twin-turbocharged W12 engine that sent its 1,000 Nm (737 lb-ft) torque in all corners via an eight-speed automatic transmission. The drivetrain also featured all-wheel steering, torque vectoring, and a rear eLSD.",BENTLEY,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Batur"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""grand touring coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""sleek"", ""distinctive"", ""powerful"", ""elegant""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""V-shaped"", ""boat-inspired""],    ""hood"": [""center-spined"", ""vented""],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [""functional"", ""cooling areas""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""exhaust vents""],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""twin-turbocharged""]  }}```"
BMW X6 M,"BMW refreshed the X6 lineup at the beginning of 2023, and along with the rest of the range, the M Competition version received a well-deserved update. The world of performance SUVs was no longer a territory where just one or two brands dominated the market. Apart from Porsche's Cayenne and its sibling Lamborghini Urus, Aston Martin, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Cadillac joined the bandwagon. We didn't mention Ferrari since the Italian brand didn't say that the Purosangue was an SUV (although it was). So, in this small circle of powerful vehicles, the white-and-blue badged automaker from Munchen had to stay ahead of the game to attract more customers. BMW celebrated 50 years of its performance division M in 2022, and at the beginning of the following year, it introduced a facelift for the entire X6 range. And that meant some changes for the M Competition version as well. The car's exterior got new, slimmer headlights and a redesigned, broader grille that was flanked by wider air intakes to cool the brakes. In addition, the lower bumper sported a second grill with an integrated radar for adaptive cruise control, automatic braking, and other safety systems. Inside, customers were greeted by high-bolstered sports seats and a curved display on top of the dashboard. Fronting the driver was the instrument panel, while atop the center stack was the iDrive 8 infotainment touchscreen. But the most significant changes were made under the car's skin. While the ICE powerplant remained the same, the automaker added a 48V mild-hybrid system that helped the car get improved fuel efficiency. In addition, there was a new eight-speed automatic gearbox with revised gear ratios when compared to its predecessor.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""X6"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""slimmer headlights"", ""redesigned broader grille"", ""wider air intakes"", ""high-bolstered sports seats"", ""curved display""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broader"", ""redesigned""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""slimmer""],    ""bumper"": [""lower"", ""sported a second grill""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW X2,"BMW introduced the second generation of its smallest sport activity coupe (SAC) vehicle, the X2, in late 2023 for the 2024 model year, continuing the success story opened by the X2’s first generation that was unveiled in 2017. With an increased demand for small-sized, stylish crossovers suitable for urban environments, BMW considered that the X2 could be an excellent alternative. And it was for many customers. Even if it was mostly a re-shaped BMW X1 or Mini Countryman, the coupe-shaped vehicle attracted enough customers to convince the German automaker that it deserved a successor. As a result, six years after the introduction of the X2 on the market, BMW unveiled the second generation for it, a vehicle that was available with either an internal combustion engine under its hood or an all-electric drivetrain named iX2. While it still shared its underpinnings with the X1, the 2023 X2 boasted a sportier image than its sibling. The front fascia revealed a new approach for one of the brand’s most important design elements, the kidney grille. BMW dropped the idea of creating tall and narrow ones but wider ones. To further emphasize it, the automaker offered the option of an LED strip that surrounded it. On the upper sides, the designers placed the LED headlights (with an option for adaptive LED ones), while underneath, it offered an option for two bumpers, depending on the packages. The M-package boasted one with a broad center air intake flanked by functional scoops, plus a splitter for the iX35 M version. From its profile, the low greenhouse with a roofline sloped back behind the rear doors emphasized the car’s sporty look despite being a crossover. Finally, at the back, the LED taillights created the image of a wider vehicle. But it was not just an illusion since the X2’s second generation was bigger in all dimensions than its predecessor. Inside, customers could get the car with bolstered or high-bolstered front seats and a bench seat profiled for two in the back. The driver fronted a digital instrument cluster complemented by the iDrive’s infotainment system touchscreen placed atop the center stack. A tall center console separated the driver from its side passenger, creating two distinct compartments at the cabin’s front. In the back, even if the bench seat was profiled for two, it was fitted with three headrests and seat belts. Furthermore, the split-folding seatback (40/20/40) extended the 560-liter (19.8 cu-ft.) trunk space. This was one of the most significant improvements over the X2’s first generation, which suffered from a small luggage area. Right from the start, the X2 was available with a choice of diesel and gasoline engines, with front-wheel drive or all-wheel-drive, and all versions were fitted with eight-speed automatic transmissions and mild-hybrid systems that improved fuel efficiency. The range-topper version of the ICE-powered X2, the iX35M, was powered by a two-liter turbocharged gasoline unit that offered 300 PS (296 hp), while the base model featured an inline-three turbocharged with a 170 ponies (168 hp) spark-ignited powerplant.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""X2"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""small-sized, bigger in all dimensions"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""stylish"", ""crossover"", ""urban"", ""re-shaped""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wider"", ""LED-surrounded""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""adaptive LED""],    ""bumper"": [""broad center air intake"", ""functional scoops"", ""splitter""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""low greenhouse"", ""sloped roofline""],    ""roof"": [""sloped back""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW X6,"BMW introduced the first generation of the X6 in 2007, and its coupe-like shape shook the world since, after all, it was a high-rider. But despite the world financial crisis from those years, customers bought it. Thus, by 2020, the car had already reached its third generation. But the automaker had to refresh it, and in February 2023, it launched the facelifted version for it. Thus, just like its X5 sibling, the X6 featured went through some mild changes to the car's exterior, some significant upgrades on the interior, and an electrified engine range. At the front, the X6 received a new bumper that sported a broad lower grille with an angular look and was flanked by a pair of slim, vertical air inlets. In addition, the automaker installed redesigned headlights with integrated V-shaped turn-signals/daytime running lights pointing outward. At the back, the X6 showed its new LED taillights that were well extended into the tailgate. Inside, the cabin boasted sports seats fitted as standard, fronting the redesigned digital dashboard. This consisted of a 12.3"" instrument panel and a massive 14.9"" touchscreen for the iDrive 8's infotainment system. At the back, the X6 offered a 40/20/40 split-folding bench that could expand the trunk space from 580 liters (20.4 cu-ft) to 1,530 liters (54 cu-ft). Under the hood, BMW installed revised gasoline engines helped by mild-hybrid systems that helped reduce emissions. In addition, a three-liter inline-six turbo-diesel, also helped by a mild-hybrid unit, was offered depending on the market.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""X6"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""high-rider"",  ""overall-design"": [""coupe-like"", ""angular"", ""electrified"", ""refreshed"", ""mild changes""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""angular""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""redesigned"", ""slim"", ""integrated"", ""V-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [""new"", ""sporting""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW X5,"BMW introduced a facelifted version of the X5 in February 2023, bringing some exterior changes, a more significant interior upgrade, and 48V plug-in hybrid drive systems. Ever since the model's introduction on the market back in 1999, the X5 has enjoyed great success. Soon, it was the talk of the day at every automotive gathering since everyone was asking why BMW started to make SUVs. But the waiting lists for these vehicles were high. The high-rider drove like a car, provided an MPV-like interior space, and was luxurious in many ways. But fast forward to 2023, the car was already at its fourth generation's facelift, and the sales were still consistent. Yet, the automaker considered that it was time for a change. At the front, the headlights got slimmer, and the v-shaped turn signals/daytime running lights pointed outwards replaced the former hexagonal-shaped ones featured in the 2020 model year. In addition, the front bumper was changed and sported a lower U-shaped grille flanked by slim and tall vertical air inlets that channeled the air to the sides of the vehicle. At the back, the automaker installed new taillights. But it was the interior that went through a major upgrade. The instrument cluster consisted of a 12.3"" digital panel and a 14.9"" center display for the infotainment unit. Both were covered by the same curved piece of glass. In addition, the X5 also boasted the iDrive 8 operation system. BMW also installed standard sports seats for the front passengers. Previously, these were offered as an option. Last but not least, specific versions could be ordered with a third row of seats. Under the hood, the German automaker introduced a mild hybrid system for the diesel version. At the same time, BMW offered a choice of three gasoline engines that also benefited from electrification.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""X5"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""lower U-shaped"", ""slim"", ""tall"", ""vertical""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""slimmer"", ""v-shaped turn signals/daytime running lights""],    ""bumper"": [""changed"", ""sporty"", ""lower U-shaped""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW X5 M,"BMW refreshed the X5 lineup at the beginning of 2023, and along with the rest of the range, the M Competition version received a well-deserved update. While customers started to ask for more performance-oriented SUVs that were good for families but also incredibly fast on regular roads, BMW stepped ahead. Starting with the second generation of the X5 it also introduced the M version. Fast forward to the fourth generation that was launched in 2019, and the M version was more powerful than ever, especially when fitted with the Competition package. For the 2023 model year, the X5 M Competition received a new and improved front fascia fitted with slimmer headlights and a redesigned grille. This was broader and flanked by enlarged air intakes that cooled the massive front brakes. In addition, the lower bumper received a redesigned grille. The X5 M Competition boasted a luxurious cabin with leather upholstery and a hexagonal pattern on the door cards. In addition, the automaker added carbon-fiber trims on the dashboard, center stack, and center console. BMW also installed a new dashboard fitted with a curved screen that hosted the instrument panel and the iDrive 8 infotainment system. But the most significant changes were made under the car's skin.

BMW M2,"BMW introduced the second generation of the M2 nameplate in the fall of 2022, which was more than some expected. Following its predecessor recipe, the 2022 M2 featured a heart of an M3/M4 stuck in the body of the smaller, nimbler, 2-Series bodywork. Only this time, it was slightly on par in terms of performance with its bigger siblings than its predecessor. Compared with the 2015 M2, it gained 90 more ponies under the hood but was also heavier. The German carmaker extensively modified the car's exterior compared with its non-M siblings. At the front, the grille was blacked out and more angular. In addition, the front bumper featured squared side scoops and a rectangular center air intake. On the other hand, the flared fenders, both front, and rear, gave the car a muscular appearance. Finally, at the back, the automaker also appealed to the same squared design for the lower bumper and a series of angular cuts and lines, which were unusual for an M-badged Bimmer. Finally, the trunk incorporated a duck-tail that evoked the glorious E46 M3 CSL. Inside, the dashboard's design was mainly similar to the one offered as an option in the 2-Series Coupe. It sported a pair of screens covered by the same piece of glass and gave the impression of a single unit. Yet, the instrument panel was separated by the touchscreen installed atop the center stack. In addition, the performance-oriented interior was emphasized by the sports bucket seats with integrated headrests and high-bolstered areas. Under the hood, the automaker relied on the same turbocharged straight-six powerplant available for the M3 and M4. Yet, it didn't provide the same power as its bigger siblings.

BMW X7,"BMW introduced a facelifted version of its flagship SUV, the X7, in 2022 and gave it a reworked look and updated powertrains. Designed as a premium seven-seat vehicle, the biggest SUV made by the German carmaker from Munchen competed against its classic rival Mercedes-Benz GLS and, on American soil, with Cadillac Escalade. But like the three-pointed-star brand, it came with unibody construction, lowering the overall weight. The design language was similar to the one found on the 7 Series. It sported a huge kidney-grille design, which raged most of the brand's fans. Actually, only about 20% agreed with them, according to BMW, but they gave it a shot anyway. The full-LED headlights were deeply buried inside the upper side of the bumper and were complemented by daytime running lights above them, like a pair of eyebrows. Inside, BMW refreshed some of the materials and the technique used. Thus, thanks to the newly developed mats and roof, the cabin ensured superior acoustic comfort. Moreover, the carmaker offered the X7 in a six-seat configuration, with two captain seats in the middle row, while the rearmost passengers were greeted by two comfortable seats. Like its predecessor, the 2022 X7 was exclusively available as an all-wheel drive vehicle. The powertrains came from either an inline-six turbodiesel or a V8. Both versions were paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission with integrated electric assistance for the mild-hybrid system.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""X7"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""biggest SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""reworked"", ""similar to 7 Series""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""huge"", ""controversial kidney-grille design""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""full-LED"", ""deeply buried"", ""complemented by daytime running lights""],    ""bumper"": [""upper side with deeply buried headlights""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""refreshed materials for superior acoustic comfort""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW 7 Series,"BMW introduced the seventh generation of its flagship model, the 7 Series, shocking the world with its new design but pleasing everyone with the new technologies offered. After almost half of century since the launch of the 7 Series' first generation, the German carmaker introduced the seventh sequel of this lineup. It came with lots of innovations and, for the first time, a fully electric version aimed against the EQS from its traditional competitor, Mercedes-Benz. When BMW launched the 2001 model-year 7 Series, it rocked the world with its disruptive design. Most people didn't like it, but it was the best-selling 7 Series until then. Two decades later, the 2022 model year tried to walk into its ancestors' shoes and featured an intriguing design. Its front fascia sported the tallest and widest grille ever mounted on the German brand flagship model. Moreover, the LED daytime running lights were installed very high and looked like eyebrows above the LED headlights buried deep into the upper side of the bumper, flanking the massive grille. Lower, on the apron, the carmaker added another set of grilles and air-intakes. Another shocking detail was the reinterpreted design element, known as the Hofmeister kink, which sported an angular shape at the bottom of the C-pillar. Inside, the car featured a 12.3"" display behind the steering wheel and, in addition, another 14.9"" touchscreen for the infotainment system. Both of them were covered under a common glass, giving the impression of a very long, continuous display. The 2022 7 Series also featured a standard Panoramic Sky Lounge LED roof, which consisted of a single, fixed glass surface surrounded by a steel frame, covered by an electrically operated interior sliding shade. The comfort and luxury level of this new Bavarian flagship was enhanced with a plethora of options, including a 31.3"" 8K touchscreen display fitted with Amazon Fire TV. Under the hood, right from the start, the 2022 7 Series offered a choice of three engines. The base version featured a new, Miller-cycle, twin-turbo inline-six aided by a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. Next in line was the 760i version with a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8, while the most important addition was the i7 xDrive60, the first full-electric 7 Series in history.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""7 Series"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""shocking"", ""innovative"", ""intriguing"", ""luxurious"", ""disruptive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""tallest"", ""widest"", ""massive""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""buried deep""],    ""bumper"": [""angular""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""Panoramic"", ""LED""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW 3 Series Touring,"BMW refreshed the seventh generation of the 3 Series in 2022 and, besides the sedan, the station wagon was upgraded as well. In 1985, BMW introduced a station wagon version for the 3 Series, named Touring. It was a big hit for the German carmaker, especially since there were not too many choices for premium station wagons in the compact segment. The carmaker revised the car's exterior by introducing new, narrower headlights that were available with adaptive LEDs. Moreover, the car received a few options for the front bumpers, including an option for the M Sport Package and M Sport Package Pro. The latter was newly introduced for the lineup. While the aggressive design was nothing unusual for the sedan, the station wagon usually was not that daring. On the sides, the blacked-out B- and C-pillars tried in vain to resemble a shooting brake. At the back, the available diffuser completed the car's sporty look together with the roof spoiler mounted on top of the tailgate. Inside, the most significant change was on the dashboard, which featured the BMW Curved Display. In addition, the carmaker installed a 12.3"" instrument panel in front of the panel and an additional 14.9"" infotainment screen above the center stack. This came with the BMW Operating System 8. As for the trunk space, nothing changed when compared with the 2019 3 Series Touring. Under the hood, BMW installed a wide choice of engines, ranging between 148 hp (150 PS) and 369 hp (374 PS), with either four or six cylinders fed by gasoline or diesel. Moreover, a plug-in hybrid version was also available. Depending on the engine version and options, the power went to the rear or in all corners via a manual or an automatic transmission.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""3 Series"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""sporty"", ""premium""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""narrower""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""adaptive"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""front"", ""M Sport Package"", ""M Sport Package Pro"", ""aggressive""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [""available""],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW 3 Series Sedan,"After a little over three years on the market, the seventh generation of the BMW 3 Series received an update, or LCI (Life Cycle Impulse), as the carmaker named it. The 3 Series was the most successful model in BMW's history, selling over 16 million of them between 1975 and 2021 in seven generations. Moreover, between October 2018, when the seventh generation was introduced at the Paris Motor Show, and May 2022, when the car received an LCI, it was sold in over 1 million units, making it the best selling generation compared to its predecessors. Still, the German carmaker decided to keep the sales figures up and refreshed the range. With its refreshed front fascia, the 3 Series sedan looked even sportier thanks to the reshaped headlights and the enlarged ""kidney-grille"" at the front. Moreover, as an option, the carmaker added adaptive LED headlamps. Last but not least, the aggressive design could have been enhanced even more with the optional M Sport Package and M Sport Package Pro, the latter being available for the first time in the 3 Series. The interior went through a significant upgrade with the introduction of the BMW Curved Display, which featured the 12.3"" instrument panel in front of the driver and the 14.9"" infotainment screen atop the center stack. Both panels were covered by the same piece of glass, creating a flowing sensation as a unique wide display. Under the hood, BMW installed a wide choice of engines, ranging between 148 hp (150 PS) and 369 hp (374 PS), with either four or six cylinders fed by gasoline or diesel.

BMW 8 Series Convertible,"BMW refreshed the entire range of the 8-Series in 2022, and that included the open-top version as well, adding more refinement, more technology, and small design cues to the beautiful drop-top grand tourer. The first generation of the 8-Series, the E 31, was introduced by the carmaker in 1990. In its coupe version, it was an instant success despite its high price. Its only flaw was that it was not available as a convertible. Later on, after it was withdrawn from the market, the coupe version gained traction. In 2018, the carmaker decided to re-launch the respectable nameplate and give it a second chance. This time, it did all the things right. For the refreshed version, BMW applied an M aerodynamic package to the whole range. Its front bumper featured a V-shaped grille in bumper, flanked by the air-scoops that channeled the air to the front brake discs. Behind the wheel-wells, a set of extracting vents helped the vehicle decrease the drag resistance. For the roof, BMW opted for a classic fabric top. Like the non-facelifted version, the car needed just 15 seconds from the top up to top-down. Inside the cabin, there was hardly room enough for four passengers. Under the hood, surprisingly, BMW still offered a turbodiesel version for its elegant and fast grand tourer. Yet, it enhanced it with a hybrid system to get lower CO2 emissions, in line with the 2022 requirements. Power went to the rear or both axles, depending on the version.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""8-Series"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""elegant, fast grand tourer"",  ""overall-design"": [""refined"", ""technological"", ""beautiful"", ""classic"", ""elegant""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""angled""],    ""grille"": [""V-shaped""],    ""hood"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""M aerodynamic"", ""flanked by air-scoops""],    ""wheel"": [""behind the wheel-wells"", ""extracting vents""],    ""doors"": [""classic fabric top""],    ""roof"": [""classic fabric top""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""turbodiesel"", ""hybrid system""]  }}```"
BMW 8 Series Coupe,"BMW refreshed the 8 series lineup in 2022, after four years since the car's initial launch in 2018. It was a mild facelift for the car that revived a '90s nameplate in the German carmaker stable. After BMW revived the 6 series in 2003 and used that name for two generations, it continued with the 8, resembling one of the greatest GT vehicles made by the Bavarian brand. With all the dots connected, the 2022 model came as its non-facelifted version in three flavors: coupe, convertible, and gran coupe (four doors). The car came with the same elongated silhouette and a sloped roofline that emerged to the trunk lid for the coupe version. In addition, BMW offered an option for a carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) roof. A double-bubble design was also adopted, with a central indentation that crossed the car from the windscreen to the rear window. Starting with the 2022 model, all 8-Series models came fitted with an M-package, with a V-shaped center grille in the bumper flanked by two wide scoops that channeled the air to the front discs. On the sides, behind the wheel-wells, BMW installed extracting vents. The classic dashboard layout with a rectangular instrument cluster and a driver-oriented center stack featured two digital displays: a TFT for the dials and gauges and a touch-screen for the infotainment unit. The tall center console separated the front seats, creating a single-seat sensation for the driver. Under the hood, surprisingly, BMW still offered a turbodiesel version for its elegant and fast grand tourer.

BMW M8 Convertible,"Since the open-top vehicles are usually slower than their coupe siblings, most car enthusiasts prefer the latter for performance. Yet, the convertibles are somehow more attractive, and thus, there is a serious market for them, especially if they are fitted with high-power engines. The M8 Competition Convertible received a facelifted version at the beginning of 2022, along with its hard-roof versions, the Coupe, and the Gran Coupe. Yes, it couldn't match them in terms of acceleration times or hard-cornering abilities, but it had more flavor with the top down while cruising on the streets. Along with the facelifted version, it received minor exterior details. Apart from the color palette, which was enlarged, it kept the same appearance. The same bumper with black inserts and wide center grille in the lower apron dominated the front fascia, while the side scoops kept their hexagonal mesh pattern for the ducts that channeled the air to the front disc brakes. The light-alloy wheels, though, were changed with a standard 20"" set and a few options for other designs with the same size. Its M8 predecessor featured a set of 19"" as standard with an option for 20"" alloys. The cockpit went through some changes and received a 12.3"" touch screen atop the center stack. It replaced the older, 10.25"" unit from the 2018 model and also got some upgrades for the infotainment system in terms of performance. The M8 Convertible featured standard sport seats with multiple adjustments, while the carmaker offered an option for Carbon bucket seats for those who still wanted to try the car's muscles on a track. Under the hood, there were no surprises. It still had the same 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 that provided 600 PS (592 hp) for the M8 and 625 PS (616 hp) for the Competition version.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""M8 Competition Convertible"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""attractive"", ""flavorful"", ""facelifted"", ""sporty"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""open-top"", ""sleek""],    ""grille"": [""wide"", ""dominant"", ""black inserts""],    ""hood"": [""same appearance""],    ""headlights"": [""sleek""],    ""bumper"": [""same"", ""black inserts""],    ""wheel"": [""light-alloy"", ""20-inch"", ""multiple design options""],    ""doors"": [""standard""],    ""roof"": [""convertible"", ""top down""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""twin-turbo""]  }}```"
BMW M8 Coupe,"BMW introduced a facelifted version for the 8th Series' second generation in 2022, and it offered it with the M-treatment for every body shape. But the brand's purists couldn't choose anything else than the coupe version. When the first generation of the 8-Series, the E31, was unveiled, BMW's fans asked for an M-version. The carmaker worked on that, made the prototype, and then hid it into storage, where it remained forever. But with the second generation of the 8-Series, which happened in 2018, the carmaker didn't avoid the high-performance version for it and made the M8 Competition. Moreover, it offered it on all three body styles: Coupe, Convertible, and Gran Coupe. Like the rest of the facelifted range, the M8 Competition showed up with the M-specific front bumper that featured a wide air intake on the front apron, flanked by two scoops that cooled the brakes. To release the air trapped inside the wheel-well, the carmaker added an extracting vent on each side of the vehicle, on the front fenders. The hood featured two longitudinal bulges, like a warning for V-engine underneath it. Unlike the rest of the range, the M8 Competition came fitted as standard with 20"" light-alloy wheels. The interior was upgraded, and the most striking difference was for the infotainment screen, which stood atop the center stack. Unlike the non-facelifted version, it featured a standard 12.3"" display instead of the older 10.25"" units used before. The interior is upholstered in Merino leather/Alcantara as standard, with either M sport seats or M carbon bucket seats, depending on the option. Under the hood, the V8 twin-turbo powerplant delivered enough performance to chase most supercars from its era. As usual, the coupe version was a little bit quicker on the 0-62 mph (0-100 kph) run than the convertible.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""8th Series"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""facelifted"", ""high-performance"", ""M-specific"", ""wide air intake"", ""extracting vent""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""longitudinal bulges"", ""V-engine warning""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""wide air intake"", ""front apron"", ""cooling scoops""],    ""wheel"": [""20\"" light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW X1,"BMW introduced the third generation of its smallest SAV, the X1, in 2022, and it was not only the smallest but also the most affordable crossover vehicle built by the German brand. When BMW launched the first generation of the X1 in 2009, it was a daring move that proved successful. Despite its narrow interior, it was an excellent car for those who needed a small vehicle for urban driving. It was also suitable enough for long trips. Unfortunately, since it was based on a platform fitted with a longitudinal engine, it couldn't offer too much interior space. But that was changed starting with the second generation, and, in 2009, the third reiteration gained more traction on the market. For the exterior, BMW installed a pair of swept-back headlights that resembled those mounted on the 3 Series, with an option for adaptive LED headlamps. The massive front grille was not that big anymore. It looked almost normal for the car's size. The X1's profile revealed an ascending beltline that ended with the already famous ""Hofmeister Kink"" imagined back in the early 70s. Luckily, the design team created the 2022 X1 to look more like an SUV than a regular station wagon. Inside, the X1 revealed an elegant cabin with a curved display that showed the data needed by the driver fronting the steering wheel. At the same time, the infotainment unit placed atop the center stack gave the impression of a single, continuous panel. Moreover, thanks to the front-wheel-drive architecture and the transverse-mounted engine, the carmaker could offer a wider interior space. The 2022 X1 covered all the bases with either front or rear-wheel drive, with gasoline or turbo-diesel engines under the hood. In addition, all versions benefited from the 48v mild-hybrid technology.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""X1"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""swept-back headlights"", ""ascending beltline"", ""elegant cabin"", ""curved display"", ""transverse-mounted engine""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""massive front grille"", ""normal-sized grille""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back"", ""adaptive LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW 2 Series Active Tourer,"The small-segment minivan, BMW 2 Series Active Tourer, offered a roomier interior for families while keeping the manufacturer’s premium feeling. With a front fascia that revealed a broad and tall grille, the 2 Series Active Tourer tried on convincing customers that it was a bigger car. Yet, its 4.4 m (173”) length didn’t confirm that. At least, viewed in the rearview mirror, it could impress a bit. Its raked windshield and long greenhouse related to the overall vehicle’s length created somehow an SUV stance, or at least of a crossover. Viewed from its sides, it looked like someone took a 2 Series hatchback and pulled the roof upwards, lengthening the side pillars and the door panels. Inside, the carmaker installed a dashboard with clean lines, in a minimalist design concept. BMW installed a digital instrument cluster instead of the older analog ones from its predecessor. It continued the display with an additional one that sat atop the center stack, with a touch-screen unit for the infotainment system. On the center console, extended under the dashboard, the carmaker placed a storage area with a wireless charger for mobile phones. The designers relocated the gearbox controls on the center armrest. Since the vehicle was designed for families, the carmaker created ample legroom for all five seats thanks to their raised mounting position. BMW selected a wide engine choice for the drivetrain, either gasoline, turbodiesel, or hybrid, with plug-in hybrid versions from 2022. The 2 Series Active Tourer was the first from its stables that came fitted as standard with a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox on the entire range. There was no manual option for it.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""BMW 2 Series Active Tourer"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""roomy interior"", ""premium feeling"", ""SUV stance"", ""minimalist dashboard"", ""wide engine choice""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""tall""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""clean lines"", ""minimalist design""],    ""roof"": [""long greenhouse""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe,"BMW released the 4 Series Gran Coupe in mid-2021, just a couple of days after it refreshed stablemates X3 and X4. When the German carmaker decided to split the 3 Series into two distinct models, the customers didn't seem too happy. At first, the difference between the two twin brothers was just the door numbers. Even the former 3 Series Gran Coupe became a 4 Series Gran Coupe, but without too many changes. But that changed starting with the G26 generation. One of the most controversial parts of the 4 Series was the front fascia, which featured an oversized and tall kidney-grille with chromed surroundings and a 3D mesh pattern, but it resembled the former BMW 327 from 1937 and 1952 501. Its LED headlights looked mean and aggressive. Like its predecessor, the 2021 4 Series GC featured frameless windows for all the doors. Thus, it stayed in the four-door coupe league, with a sloped-down, fastback-like tailgate. The streamlined taillights create the illusion of a more comprehensive vehicle at the back, thanks to their horizontal LED lines. Inside, the upgrade in the technical department was significant. The base models featured an 8.8"" screen above the center stack for the iDrive infotainment system and a 5.1"" color display in the instrument cluster. At the front, the high-bolstered front bucket seats provided enough side support for their occupants during high-speed cornering maneuvers. In the back, there was a bench for three adults. Even though the transmission tunnel was present, it wasn't that tall anymore and narrower. Thus, the rear middle passenger could place his or her feet under the left and right front seats. The 60/40 rear bench' seatback increased the trunk space from 470 liters (16.6 cu-ft) up to 1,290 liters (45.5 cu-ft). Under the hood, the carmaker provided an engine range fit for a sporty four-door coupe. The base version featured a four-banger, turbocharged gasoline unit, while the top of the range M 440i received a 3.0-liter inline-six turbocharged powerplant.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""4 Series Gran Coupe"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""four-door coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""streamlined"", ""fastback-like"", ""mean"", ""aggressive"", ""sloped-down""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""oversized"", ""tall"", ""chromed"", ""3D mesh pattern""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""mean"", ""aggressive""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""frameless""],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW 2 Series Coupe,"BMW unveiled the 2022 2 Series Coupe at the 2021 Goodwood Festival of Speed and, even though the hatchback sibling was front-wheel-drive, the two-door version kept the traditional rear-wheel-drive system. When the German carmaker decided to change the names for its cars, it kept the even numbers for the coupes and the odd ones for the regular four or five doors versions. That's why the 1 Series Coupe became a 2 Series, and it was a relief for BMW fans when the compact vehicle appeared with an RWD or an AWD system. The car's exterior showed a different front fascia than its bigger brother, the 4 Series. It didn't sport the tall and narrow ""kidney-grille"" but a flat and broad one. Its slim, LED headlights with an underlining daytime running light showed an aggressive look, and the wide grille on the lower side of the bumper complemented it. The enlarged front and rear fenders made room for wider tires of up to 255/35 R 19 on the rear and 225/40 R19 at the front, depending on the options. Inside, BMW packed all the 2021 technology, including the Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. An 8.8"" touch-screen infotainment display was offered as standard, while a 10.25"" was on the options list. A 12.3"" digital panel found its place in the instrument cluster and could show the usual information about the car and the navigation map or the music played on the sound system. Like its predecessor, the 2 Series Coupe featured two bucket seats at the front and a bench for two in the rear, with limited legroom and headroom but still suitable enough for short trips. The trunk offered up to 390 liters (13.8 cu-ft) of space. Under the hood, BMW installed a choice of gasoline and turbo-diesel engines.

BMW X4,"BMW introduced a facelifted version for the X4 just three years after introducing the second-generation's model. After successfully revolutionizing the automotive industry with the SAV-Coupe X6, BMW introduced a smaller brother named X4, which appeared in 2014. In 2018, the carmaker introduced a second-generation for it and then refreshed it in 2021. Thus, it matched the exact timetable with the other compact-sized SAV (Sport Activity Vehicle), the X3. Both vehicles shared the same CLAR (Cluster Architecture) platform with their bigger brother X5 and other sedans. BMW introduced a new front bumper design with a single section frame kidney-grille adorned by a mesh design. Its adaptive Matrix LED headlights were standard and flattered by 10 mm (0.4"") than on the non-facelifted version. On the sides, all versions came fitted as standard with specific side-sills, finished in light gray. At the back, the X4 featured LED taillights with a 3D design and horizontal lines to emphasize the car's width. The apron sported wide free-form tailpipe trims. Inside, BMW installed a 10.25"" wide format infotainment screen above the center stack, with an option for a 12.3"" display, in the same free-floating look.

BMW X3,"Four years after introducing the third generation of the X3, BMW introduced a refreshed version for it, with upgrades in all the areas: exterior, interior, and drivetrain. The 2017 X3 shared the same CLAR (Cluster Architecture) platform with its bigger brother, the 2019 X5. Worth mentioning that the third X3 generation was already more extended than the first X5 generation. The X3 already matched its bigger brother's technologies with the facelifted version and offered a better choice for an all-around vehicle. Since it was shorter than the fourth-generation X5, it was easier to drive it in cities. From the outside, the X3 LCI (life-cycle impulse) featured a new front bumper with an enlarged kidney grille with a single section frame. Its standard LED headlights, with an option for Matrix LED, were 10 mm (0.4"") flatter. On the sides, all versions came fitted as standard with specific side-sills, finished in light gray. At the back, there was a new design for the taillights with horizontal turn signals. Depending on the version, the car featured new flush-fitting free-form exhausts. Inside, BMW installed a 10.25"" wide format infotainment screen above the center stack, with an option for a 12.3"" display, in the same free-floating look. All versions featured a three-zone automatic climate control for more comfort on the rear seats. The redesigned center console featured a new shape for the gear-selector and the iDrive's rotary knob.

BMW 4 Series Convertible,"Changing from soft-top to hard-top just a few years ago seemed to be a good idea, but in 2020 BMW did the exact opposite by switching from hard-top to soft-top for the 4-Series convertible. BMW had a long history with open-top vehicles, even before WWII. The German car-maker always mastered the mix between the driving pleasure in a sports car and the open-top experience with minimal or no compromise in performances. The first element that stood apart on the car's image was the grille. It was massive and extended down into the apron, eliminating the other grille from the bumper. The side-pods hosted the fog lights and fake air-intakes for the brake discs. The LED headlights were fitted as standard while the laser lights were on the options list. The 4-Series convertible featured a clean look, with curved surfaces, unaltered by sculptured doors from the sides. The designers installed a pair of fake vents behind the rear wheels and a couple of exhaust tips in the back. The interior was suitable for four adults due to the big, 2.85m (112.2"") wheelbase. Since the soft-top took less room than the hard-top, the rear bench could have been moved almost over the rear axle. Due to the new system, the trunk offered 80 liters (2.82 cu-ft) more room than its predecessor. But that was not all. The soft-top could have been opened or closed at speeds of up to 50 kph (31 mph) in 18 seconds. The 4-Series convertible was fitted with a choice of four engines ranged from 184 hp up to 374 hp with either rear- or all-wheel-drive. All versions were fitted with 8-speed automatic transmission. To comply better into the Euro 6d requirements, a mild-hybrid diesel version was added to the range.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""4-Series convertible"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""2.85m (112.2\"") wheelbase"",  ""overall-design"": [""clean look"", ""curved surfaces"", ""minimal compromise"", ""suitable for four adults"", ""compliance with Euro 6d requirements""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""extended"", ""clean look""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""laser lights on options list""],    ""bumper"": [""eliminated other grille""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [""soft-top"", ""opened or closed at speeds of up to 50 kph (31 mph) in 18 seconds""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""a pair of exhaust tips in the back""]  }}```"
BMW M5,"BMW M relentlessly tried to make its cars quicker and faster than its competitors, and the CS versions were even wilder. When you lock a car-maniac into its room due to a world pandemic situation, all they had to do was think about how to make a car faster. Maybe exactly that happened to the BMW M engineers, who had to work from home in the infamous year 2020. Unlike the rest of us, who wore out the TV remote controller and made a new couch to look like it was older than the house itself, they prepared an outrageous vehicle: the M5 CS. Forget about the heavy, regular M5 (which was already a fast car) and look at the front, yellow, daytime running lights. We would name them “angel eyes” like anyone else, but we are afraid not to be banned forever from Heaven. They looked from the dark side. The grille was not tall, like on the M4, but shorter and above the sculptured bumpers that sported a lower grille and two side-scoops (functional). A carbon-fiber splitter helped to reduce the ground effect at higher speeds. BMW M made the hood and other parts from carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP). Some elements were left unpainted. Why bother? They looked better that way. Through the standard, 20” light-alloy-wheels, the car sported the red calipers. Inside, the carmaker dropped the 5-seat option and installed four M Carbon sport-bucket seats. At the front, the integrated headrests sported illuminated M5 logos and displayed the outline of the Nurburgring race-track. Behind the steering wheel, the engineers installed two carbon-fiber paddle-shifters for the 8-speed automatic M Steptronic gearbox. Inside the instrument cluster, there was no dial or gauge: just a wide digital customizable display. Under the hood, M engineers dropped the most powerful engine ever installed in a BMW. The 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 provided 635 hp, which were sent in all corners. Like its non-CS brother, it was able to send all the torque to the rear wheels for spectacular drifts.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""M5 CS"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""sporty"", ""carbon-fiber"", ""functional"", ""powerful""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""short"", ""sculptured"", ""above"", ""functional""],    ""hood"": [""carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic"", ""unpainted""],    ""headlights"": [""front"", ""yellow"", ""daytime running""],    ""bumper"": [""sculptured"", ""lower grille"", ""side-scoops""],    ""wheel"": [""20-inch"", ""light-alloy"", ""red calipers""],    ""doors"": [""four M Carbon sport-bucket seats"", ""illuminated M5 logos"", ""Nurburgring race-track outline""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""twin-turbo"", ""powerful""]  }}```"
BMW 4 Series Coupe,"While the 3 Series was reserved for the four-door sedan version, the Coupe was renamed as the 4-Series. It was the BMW strategy to enhance its lineup, and it worked. For the 2020 model year, BMW introduced a completely new 4-series in June 2020. It was based on the 2019 concept-car showed in September 2019 at Frankfurt Motor Show, one of the last important motor shows before the pandemic started. The 4-Series was a shocking appearance with its kidney-grille, which got bigger and covered the front fascia's middle side from the bottom of the apron to the hood. It was huge! On the sides of the front bumper, BMW installed a pair of vents to cool the brakes. BMW opted for standard LED units for the headlights, while the laser ones were on the options list. The sculptured door panels and the raked C-pillars resembled the silhouette of the BMW 8-Series. Dual exhaust was installed in the back, with a three-slats splitter in the middle. Inside, the car was fitted with sport-bucket seats as standard. The instrument cluster featured a TFT color display, and, on the center stack, the infotainment system was installed. It featured connectivity via Apple CarPlay, and it could support Android phones. If the car was fitted with the automatic gearbox, it was fitted with a pair of paddle-shifters as well. BMW offered the 4 Series with a power output between 184 and 374 hp, with rear- or all-wheel-drive. All versions were paired with an 8-speed automatic gearbox. The diesel versions were fitted to a mild-hybrid system to achieve better fuel efficiency and to lower CO2 emissions.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""4-Series"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""shocking appearance"", ""sculptured door panels"", ""raked C-pillars"", ""sport-bucket seats"", ""TFT color display""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""bigger"", ""covered"", ""huge""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED units"", ""laser options""],    ""bumper"": [""pair of vents""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual"", ""three-slats splitter""]  }}```"
BMW 6 Series Gran Turismo,"The fourth generation of the 6-Series Gran Turismo made a good impression in 2017 when it was introduced. In 2020 BMW announced the facelifted version for it. The facelift came into the challenging 2020 year with the world pandemic situation when all the countries faced economic difficulties. The 6-Series GT was more the successor of the 5-Series GT rather than the lines of the 6-Series, but following the new naming system from the German car-maker, it had to bear an even number. It was a 5-door hatchback in coupe-style. Both front- and rear-end shapes were refined to reflect the BMW design language. The clear geometry formed by a small number of lines provided a vivid showcase for the car's presence. The new kidney grille and headlights made a striking impression. The grille was wider and taller, maybe too big for the car's front area. The LED headlights with matrix function and non-dazzling high beam were fitted as standard while the laserlight for both beams was offered as an option. The front and rear aprons were re-shaped with narrower and taller side-intakes at the front and integrated exhausts in the back. Inside, the 6-Series GT offered enough room for up to five passengers and 600 liters (21.1 cu-ft) of trunk space. It was more than the non-facelifted version. The driving post was surrounded by the center stack and the center console, with a tilted touch-screen display placed on top of the dashboard. The instrument cluster featured a complete digital display. BMW installed new Euro 6d engines under the 6-GT's hood. All versions were fitted with the 8-speed ZF automatic transmission. It was available with a rear or all-wheel-drive. Power ranged between 190 hp for the base, inline-four, engine and was raised up to 340 hp for the inline-six turbodiesel unit.

BMW 5 Series Sedan,"Following the seven generations of the 5 Series released by BMW from 1972 until now, the German automaker presents the new 2024 BMW 5 Series as a premium vehicle destined to bring the pleasure of driving to people worldwide. The car has a full range of propulsion systems as it will come with a gasolineor diesel engines, a mild hybrid powertrain, or a fully electric version in the form of the BMW i5. The models can be equipped with an 8-speed automatic Steptronic Sport transmission capable of smoothly shifting through the gears to produce a distinguished feeling when accelerating. By having an almost perfect 50:50 axle weight distribution, the 5 Series is capable of impressive dynamic performances, whether it comes in the all-wheel drive xDrive version or not. The front view of the BMW represents a modern interpretation of the classic headlights separated by the established bean-shaped grille, which has an optional feature of coming with a BMW Iconic Glow contour lighting. Two L-shaped taillights that are divided but simultaneously highlighted by a chrome stripe define the back of the new 5 Series. With a familiar side-view based on the previous model, the new model offers a look that enhances its dynamic character with the optional M Sport Package and the M Sport Package Pro. While highly technologized, the new BMW 5 Series Sedan is the brand's first model to feature a fully vegan interior as standard. By consistently digitalizing functions, the new BMW 5 Series cockpit has a considerably reduced quantity of buttons and controls in comparison to its predecessor. The BMW Curved Display makes the driving experience more effortless, as it is centered around the driver. The redesigned steering wheel features a flattened lower section to ease the maneuvering of the BMW. Also, an impressive highlight is the optional BMW Interaction Bar, which spans the entire width of the instrument panel and extends into the door panels. Besides the standard Parking Assistant and Reversing Assist, the vehicle can optionally have a Parking Assistant Professional feature that can provide automated parking and remote maneuvering from the mobile app. Although, the real innovation comes with Highway Assistant, a technology that includes the world's first Active Lane Change Assistant with eye confirmation. The Highway Assistant, available only in Canada, Germany, and the USA, enables the driver to take his hands off the steering wheel at speeds up to 85 mph and relax while keeping his eyes on the road. The Active Lane Change feature helps the driver-vehicle interaction reach a new level. The vehicle now offers lane change suggestions, which can be confirmed by looking in the exterior mirror before executing the lane change, a first-time capability implemented by BMW's engineers.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""BMW 5 Series"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""midsize"",  ""overall-design"": [""modern"", ""dynamic"", ""premium"", ""technologized"", ""effortless""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""bean-shaped"", ""optional Iconic Glow contour lighting""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""modern"", ""separated""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW 5 Series Touring,"The popular vehicle caught the eyes of the buyers due to its luxurious look, both the exterior and the interior design, along with the sportiness and comfort offered over the years. The Bavarian company managed to sell over 600,000 units of the 5 Series, both sedan and touring versions. The 5-Series won several awards such as the Executive Car of the Year, Connected Car Award (winner) and others, proving that its success lasted for over 28 years and still counting. The new 2020 model brought a refined look, with a bigger kidney grille in contrast with slimmer headlights. The car’s proportions were not changed, however, it gained a few inches in length. A longer wheelbase version was also available, only for the Chinese market though. The 5-Series was already known for its low coefficient drag, thus keeping the tradition, the new 2020 G30 had a Cd of 0.23 (sedan) and 0.26 for the touring, both achieved with great attention paid to the exterior lines and the air flap control system for the radiator. While the 5-series used to be the bigger version of the 3-series, the 2020 generation brought it closer to the 7-series, by offering pretty much the same optional features, as well as the standard ones. Available with the most wagons, the buyers could open the rear windscreen while leaving the trunk closed, a feature that eased the handling of light items. The G30 could be ordered with the BMW Laserlight, a system that was introduced in 2019 only for the top-of-the-line 5-series modules. The system became available for all of the existing trim levels. The 2020 release also brought the M Sport Package with a new design, including a new front apron, enlarged air intakes, kidney grille bars with aluminum matt faces and others.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""5 Series"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""bigger, longer wheelbase"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""refined"", ""proportional"", ""award-winning""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""slimmer""],    ""grille"": [""bigger"", ""contrast""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""slimmer""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""low coefficient drag"", ""attention to exterior lines""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW M4 Convertible,"BMW introduced the third body version of the M4 in late spring of 2021 with the addition of an open-top vehicle, completing the lineup. When the German carmaker decided to change the M3 nameplate from the coupe, its fans were upset. Yet, it didn't change its mind and produced the M4 as a coupe and Gran Coupe. While the former was already known on the market, the latter wast a four-door fastback fake coupe with a sloped rear liftgate. In the new clothing, the topless M4 kept the same core values from the Coupe at the front, with the twin kidney-grilles and the aggressive-looking LED headlights. Its panel soft-top could have disappeared in 18 seconds, at speeds up to 50 kph (31 mph). The new retractable roof featured a new technology that made it lighter than a hard-top and better insulated than a three-layer fabric one. BMW installed a new trunk lid at the back, which was flatter than on the M4 Coupe. Inside, there were more standard features for the four-seat convertible. Gone were the analog dials; hence the M4 convertible received a standard digital TFT instrument panel. BMW installed a 10.1"" infotainment display above the center vents. The carbon fiber and aluminum trims were also standard, along with the sport bucket seats. Behind the cabin, the carmaker managed to fit a 300 liters (10.6 cu-ft) trunk with the roof down and 385 liters (13.6 cu-ft) with the top up. The drivetrain was similar to the one fitted on the M4 Coupe, with only one difference: it was all-wheel-drive without the possibility to disengage the front wheels, as in the hard-top version.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""BMW M4"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""sleek"", ""sporty"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""twin"", ""aggressive""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""aggressive-looking""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""four-door"", ""fastback""],    ""roof"": [""retractable"", ""soft-top""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual""]  }}```"
BMW M4,"BMW had a long history of producing lightweight vehicles based on its performance models, and the 2022 M4 CSL (Competition Sport Lightweight) came as a confirmation of that. The new version came as a 2023 model year to celebrate the mighty E9 CSL that competed in 1973 in the European Touring Car Championship. This hard-core version was built with performance in mind, and it was fine-tuned on the Nurburgring race track in Germany. While the automaker used the CS letters for many vehicles, there were only two that sported all three letters: the aforementioned E9 and the 2004 M3 CSL. But in 2022, it added a third member to this exclusive club: the M4 CSL, which was produced in just 1000 units. BMW managed to shed 240 lbs (110 kg) from the weight of the M4 Competition, and that was not an easy task. On the outside, it used a carbon-fiber hood adorned with black, unpainted vents. Its roof and trunk lid were made from CFRP (carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic), and the bumpers also included many areas from the same material. Last but not least, the CSL also sported a ducktail on the rear deck. Inside, the automaker installed manual carbon-fiber sport seats that were 53 lbs (24 kg) lighter than those installed in the regular M4. In addition, there were no rear seats or seatbelts. But, despite using thinner sound-deadening materials, it still featured an infotainment system with speakers so drivers could play their favorite music while thrashing the car around a track. Under the hood, the M4 CSL received an improved inline-six, 3.0-liter turbocharged engine that sent its power to the rear wheels via an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""M4 CSL"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""lightweight"",  ""overall-design"": [""performance"", ""hard-core"", ""exclusive"", ""carbon-fiber"", ""improved""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""carbon-fiber"", ""unpainted"", ""vents""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""carbon-fiber"", ""reinforced"", ""ducktail""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""carbon-fiber"", ""CFRP""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""ducktail""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW 1 Series,"The third generation of the BMW 1-Series was a revolution for the small German car since it was based on a front-wheel-drive platform. But it didn't mean it was less performant. The success story of the 1-Series began in 2004. The sporty, nimble, small car gathered attention from everybody. The second generation was launched in 2011 and it continued the big sales numbers that reached 1.8-million units by the time the third generation appeared. From first sight, it is impossible not to notice the huge kidney-grille. The angled headlights are going upwards along with the front fenders into a more accentuated slope toward the A-pillars. Since the front-wheel-drive platform was with transverse engines, the whole front of the vehicle was shorter than the one on the previous generation. The shorter front of the car allowed a bigger greenhouse with a long roofline that dropped away toward the rear. A wide tail with big shoulders over the rear wheel arches emphasized the car's sporty look. Inside the cabin, there was more room than in the previous generation, since the engine and transmission were in front of the windshield. Since there was more room for the front seats, those were installed forward and in effect, the rear legroom was bigger. The driver had a TFT display instead of the usual dials in the instrument cluster. A new infotainment unit that features gesture controls were installed. Under the hood, there was a wide variety of engines, both diesel, and gasoline with manual or automatic transmission.

BMW 2 Series Gran Tourer,"The first generation of the 2-Series Gran Tourer was introduced in June 2015. It was the second shock for the German brand's fans, which couldn't accept a front-wheel-drive BWM. But the BMW management didn't back up and backed-up the project. They knew that the market needed a small vehicle able to carry more people inside a city and a regular 2- or 3-Series just wouldn't fit the needs. Meanwhile, the Mercedes-Benz already had the A-Class and the B-Class which were suitable for that customer segment. Despite its compact size, the 2-Series Gran Tourer offered enough room for five adults plus two children inside. Since it used the same platform as a Mini, with a transverse engine, the designers had more room for the cabin. The rear side of the car was extended when compared to the Active Tourer, to accommodate an extra set of seats in the trunk area. The facelift brought a new front fascia, with a larger and taller grille design, and new headlights. Inside, the center stack was tilted toward the driver, emphasizing its role. There were new materials used for the interior and a new BMW M-Performance package. The longer seat cushions made the vehicle more comfortable on long journeys. The customers could choose from different trim levels, including Luxury Line, Sport Line, and M Sport packages. For the powertrain, the facelift received a wide choice of three- and four-cylinder units, plus a plug-in hybrid.

BMW M3 Sedan,"BMW introduced an extreme version of its four-door sedan M3 in 2023, thus continuing a long tradition of lighter, higher-performance variants for the famous German model. The history of lightweight versions of BMW's models goes far back in time. From the famous 1972 CSL from the '70s to the E46 M3 CSL or the E92 CRT, they were all focused on one thing only: performance attained thanks to a lighter construction than their regular siblings. But the 2024 M3 CS went further than that by adding much more power to the famous S58 TwinPower Turbo inline-six engine. For this limited edition version, the German automaker introduced a special color named ""Green Goblin, "" making the car stand out from the crowd. In addition, the black accents on the hood, front bumper, side sills, and roof were hints of carbon-fiber elements used to create this spectacular four-door vehicle. Finally, at the back, the trunk lid was adorned with a carbon fiber lip spoiler. Inside, the automaker added more carbon-fiber trims on the center console, dashboard, and steering wheel. In addition, BMW ditched the formerly used seats in the regular M3 and installed a pair of carbon-fiber high-back sports seats upholstered with a combination of fabric and leather. Still, the dual-screen setup was kept so the driver could focus on the main information needed while driving or thrashing the car around the corner on a track but still use the infotainment unit for daily use. Under the hood, the automaker added 40 more ponies to the already potent M3 engine. While the all-wheel-drive setup was standard, the speed-limiter removal was not. That allowed customers to reach up to 302 kph (188 mph).",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""M3"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""four-door sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""lightweight"", ""high-performance"", ""special color"", ""carbon-fiber elements"", ""spectacular""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""black accents"", ""carbon-fiber""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""black accents"", ""carbon-fiber""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""black accents"", ""carbon-fiber""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""carbon fiber lip""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW 1 Series 3 doors,"After almost one million units sold since 2011, BMW 1 Series received a well-awaited face-lift. The new, 2017 model received new colors and a wider range of alloy wheels. Engines are ranging from a very economical three cylinder to a powerful inline six, three liter badged as M140i. They are offering both petrol and diesel engines. The  power ranges between 109 HP on the 116i and 340 HP for M140i. The main market for the 1 series is Europe, where the Bavarian manufacturer sold around 70% of its production. As expected, another big market for the premium compact size vehicle is China. It is the last model of 1 Series offered on a RWD platform. The next generation will receive a new FWD chassis, which will be shared with MINI. In the tech-department, BMW brought the latest-generation iDrive infotainment system.

BMW i3,"Due to its unusual shape and distinctive interior, the BMW i3 was either a car you liked or you didn’t. There was no in between. The 4-door hatchback offered seating for four and was one of the most practical, yet premium EV. The potential of the i3 was greatly maximised with its made shell made entirely of carbon fiber, a material that was stronger than steel and lighter than aluminum. For 2017, BMW introduced a larger battery to improve the driving range. It was available for 2 out of the 3 trim levels available, namely the base and the Range Extender version. Inside the i3 was a roomy interior, with a comfortable seating position. Quietness defined the i3’s cabin in the all-electric mode, with the only exception being the gas generator running when the battery was discharged. While lots of storage spaces were available in the cabin, the i3’s cargo area was a small size and loading heavier items was made uneasy with the high position of the trunk. The i3 was equipped with a standard business navigation. Optionally, a professional navigation was available, with a bigger screen and a hard-drive map data. An available packaged named Technology + Driving Assistant included adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with collision mitigation. A parallel parking system was available as a stand-alone feature.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""BMW i3"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""unusual shape"", ""distinctive interior"", ""practical"", ""premium"", ""roomy""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""made of carbon fiber""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW 2 Series Convertible,"BMW introduced the first generation of the 2-Series in 2013 as a coupe and, a year later, it brought the open-top version. Both were renewed in 2017. The BMW 2-Series was, in fact, a re-badged BMW 1-Series with a coupe shape. In the first 1-Series, the coupe was named just 1-Series Coupe. But no, the marketing department decided that all the coupes should wear an even number, so the 1-Series Coupe became a 2-Series, the 3-Series Coupe became a 4-Series and so on. The 2-Series Convertible shared most of its components with the 1-Series, and it received the last update before completely changing the generation in 2019. Like its closed-version, the convertible featured a mild update on the exterior. Starting with the 2017 model-year, the 2-Series received standard bi-LED headlights with a flat bottom style. As an option, the carmaker offered LED fog-lights as well. In the rear, the L-shaped taillights featured standard LEDs. A completely redesigned dashboard featured the screen for the infotainment unit on top of the center stack. The center console housed the iDrive rotary knob controller, while the center-stack kept the controls for the HVAC system. The customers could choose between five new upholstery fabrics or from seven different leather designs. BMW offered the 2-Series convertible with a choice of eight engines ranged between 136 hp and 340 hp. Depending on the engine, the car featured a 6-speed manual or an eight-speed automatic, with rear- or all-wheel-drive.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""2-Series"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""re-badged"", ""mild update"", ""flat bottom style"", ""L-shaped taillights"", ""redesigned dashboard""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""bi-LED"", ""flat bottom style""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""convertible""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW Z4 Roadster,"BMW has a long history of making roadsters all the way back to its roots. This is why it continued to make roadsters for driving pleasure. In 2018, the new generation of the Z4 was launched. Unlike the previous generation, which was available with a retractable hard-top, the new generation is available only as a roadster. Those who want a coupe will have to buy the 2018 Toyota Supra, which is almost identical but it has a fixed top. Unlike the Supra, the Z4 is available in three engine versions. The Z4 is available with a two liters engine either naturally aspirated or turbocharged, and the top version 3.0-liter turbocharged. The output range is between 197 and 340 hp. For the base model, the sDrive 2.0i, the transmission is a 6-speed manual gearbox. For all the others, an 8-speed Steptronic automatic gearbox is fitted as standard. Compared to the older version, it is bigger on the outside but has a shorter wheelbase. Now it features a 2.47 meters (97.2”) long distance between the axles, which makes the car more agile in the corners. It also has a 50:50 weight distribution. From the technology point of view, the Z4 has some interesting features. Apart from the latest digital instrument cluster and infotainment, the Z4 can be opened and locked via smartphone. Using the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, the smartphone turns into a key.

BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo,"Three years after the introduction of the 3-Series Gran Turismo at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show, the fastback version of the premium-compact BMW received a facelift. Usually, when a range is refreshed, all of its body styles receive the same treatment. BMW didn't do that for its well-known model and chose to update the 3-Series in 2015 and the GT version in 2016. But the sales figures were under expectations. For the front area, the 3-Series GT received a new pair of headlights with LED for both low and high-beam. The round tubes o the lamps were encircled by daytime driving lights. Adaptive LED headlights were offered as an option. For the M Sport Package, the 3-Series GT was offered with a different front apron with large air intake, rear bumper with diffuser insert, and side sills. In the back, the taillights were redesigned and full-LEDs. Inside, there were new materials, with higher quality. The Center Information Display received a flatter design and a narrow profile grille. On the center stack, the controls for the radio and air conditioning featured high-gloss black trim, and the radio and air conditioning controls were framed by chrome applications. Under the hood, there was a new version available for the 325d Gran Turismo. New gasoline engines from the BMW EfficientDynamics family were introduced. The 2016 3-Series GT was available with rear- or all-wheel-drive for all the gasoline versions, while for the diesel versions, it was available for the 320d and 330d, and standard for the 335d.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""3-Series Gran Turismo"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""premium-compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""fastback"", ""facelift"", ""premium""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""narrow"", ""profile""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""adaptive"", ""round""],    ""bumper"": [""large air intake"", ""diffuser insert""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""rear bumper""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW M3 Touring,"BMW introduced the first station wagon version for its top-performer 3 Series, the M3, at the Goodwood Festival of Speed 2022, aiming at those drivers who still asked for speed even after their families grew. BMW was not at its first try to sell a station wagon based on an M-badged vehicle. It did that for the first time with the M5 Touring in 1992, but with limited success. Sharing the same front fascia with its sedan sibling, the M3 Touring showed the same tall kidney-grille, albeit some called those nostrils. It was a love or hate affair for the BMW, but nevertheless very discussed worldwide. The lower bumper featured an air-intake for the engine and two side scoops to cool the brakes and divert the airflow around the bodywork. From its profile, the M3 Touring revealed its long roof ended with a small and curved roof spoiler. At the back, the quad-exhaust system and the diffuser kept the same look as the sedan, but the bumper featured a lower cut for the tailgate. Inside, the curved display and the front seats were carried over from the M3 sedan. At the back, up to three passengers could sit on the split-folding bench that could expand the trunk area from 500 liters (17.65 cu-ft) to a respectable 1,510 liters (53.3 cu-ft). But, due to the transmission tunnel that crossed the car from front to back, it was difficult to place a third person in the middle. Under the hood, the carmaker installed the same inline-six, fitted with BMW's TwinPower Turbo technology powerplant that provided 503 PS (510 hp). It was paired to an eight-speed automatic gearbox and sent the power in all corners.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""M3 Touring"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""long roof"",  ""overall-design"": [""fast"", ""sporty"", ""functional"", ""sleek"", ""aggressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""tall"", ""controversial"", ""front-facing""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""air-intake"", ""side scoops"", ""lower cut""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""small"", ""curved""],    ""diffusor"": [""quad-exhaust system"", ""same look as sedan""],    ""spoiler"": [""curved""],    ""exhaust"": [""quad"", ""same look as sedan""]  }}```"
BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe,"After it replaced the 6 Series with the 8 Series in coupe shapes, the German automaker continued its offensive on the premium sports sedans market and introduced the Gran Coupe version of the 8 Series in June 2019, and sales started in September of the same year. Based on the same CLAR architecture as the 7 Series (G11) and the 5 Series (G30) launched in 2015 and 2016, respectively. BMW competed with its four-door coupe against vehicles such as the Mercedes-Benz CLS, AMG GT 4-Door coupe, and the Panamera from Porsche. Unfortunately for the München-based automaker, its car came right before the world pandemic started, and, as a result, its sales plummeted. Still, it was an appreciated vehicle, and the wide choice of engines and options made it a desirable four-door coupe, suitable for those who wanted a luxurious vehicle but with a sporty character and demanding view on the road. The car’s front fascia was shared with its two-door sibling. It featured a pair of swept-back standard LED headlights that sported hexagonal-shaped daytime running lights. In addition, the automaker offered the option for Laser headlamps. A distinct bumper with a large center air intake in the lower part, flanked by massive side scoops, cooled the engine and the front rotors. From its profile, the extracting vents behind the front wheel wells were not just decorations, just like on its coupe sibling. Unlike that version of the 8 Series, the Gran Coupe featured more upright A-pillars and an arched roof that started to descend above the rear seats. At the back, the short deck was sloped and, depending on the version and options featured a spoiler. For the rear fascia, BMW installed a set of wide taillights extended from the quarter panels to the trunk’s lid. Inside, the automaker installed a four-seat layout with two individual seats at the front and a bench seat in the back profiled for two adult-sized passengers. Thanks to the straighter and taller greenhouse, the front seat occupants enjoyed better headroom than in the two-door coupe. The driver fronted a fully digital instrument cluster and, atop the center stack, in a free-floating position, the touchscreen for the infotainment system. The front occupants could access the menus from the iDrive unit either via touch functions or the specific rotary dial controller housed on the center stack. In the back, there was just enough headroom for those seated there, and they were divided by a tall transmission tunnel and a fold-down armrest. Under the hood, BMW installed the same engine lineup as in the coupe, fueled by gasoline or diesel. The automaker installed turbocharged inline-six and V8 units that sent power in all corners via an eight-speed automatic transmission.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""8 Series Gran Coupe"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""four-door coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""desirable"", ""wide choice of engines"", ""distinct""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""swept-back""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""distinct bumper""],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back"", ""LED"", ""hexagonal-shaped"", ""Laser option""],    ""bumper"": [""distinct"", ""large center air intake"", ""flanked by massive side scoops""],    ""wheel"": [""extracting vents behind front wheel wells""],    ""doors"": [""more upright A-pillars""],    ""roof"": [""arched"", ""descends above rear seats""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""depending on version and options""],    ""exhaust"": [""wide taillights extended from quarter panels to trunk’s lid""]  }}```"
BMW i4,"BMW raised the electric vehicles' standards and showed the electric-car industry how a proper sports sedan should be built when it introduced the i4 in 2021. While Tesla was getting more attention than anyone else when it came to electric vehicles, BMW was in its lab working on a new car. Its engineers were not concerned about what other carmakers could achieve and how fast they could reach the 60-mile mark (92 kph) from standing still. With a huge experience in car building and intensive testings for the powertrain, it delivered the i4. It used the same platform as the 4 Series to cut its costs, and it showed the same tall grille considered by some as ""Bugs Bunny teeth"" while others remembered that BMW wore the tall and narrow kidney-grille since the 30's. Its angular LED headlights and the wide black area in the front apron revealed an aggressive, sporty styling. From its sides, the four-door fastback styling resembled the X4 look, but in street clothes and lower ground clearance. Inside, the carmaker made the decisive step toward the digital revolution and deleted all analog instruments inside the cabin. The instrument panel and the touch-screen for the infotainment unit shared the same long panel spread across 60% of the dashboard. But the carmaker didn't delete some physical buttons and controls. For the powertrain, BMW charged with an all-wheel-drive electric system that provided 530 hp. Thus, it allowed the new i4 to beat the 0 to 60 mph (0-92 kph) time in less than four seconds. The carmaker promised more than 300 miles (482 km) according to the EPA tests or around 350 miles (590 km) in WLTP European tests.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""i4"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""four-door fastback"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""sporty"", ""digital"", ""angular"", ""wide""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""tall"", ""narrow"", ""angular""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angular"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""wide"", ""black""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""four-door""],    ""roof"": [""fastback""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW M4 CS,"The M4 CS was built only two years and it sat between the M4 with Competition Package and the M4 GTS. It was the best balance between a race-focused and a road car. While some other car manufacturers are building either a performance car or a track-ready vehicle, BMW decided to go mid-road with the CS. It took some parts from the M4 Competition and some parts from the GTS. After the mix was done, it added some specific features. On the outside, at the front, there was a lip-spoiler at the bottom of the apron. It was made out of carbon-fiber but it was fixed, while the GTS had it adjustable. The hood was made out of carbon-fiber as well as the one found on the GTS. In the back, the CS featured a specific lip on the trunk. For the wheels, the car was fitted with 19” light-alloy wheels in the front and 20” wheels in the back, equipped with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. Inside, there was a mix of race-inspired features and comfort. The door panels and the seats were carried-over the GTS. The suspension was taken from the Competition model. The infotainment system was similar to the one in the regular M4. Under the hood, there was the same inline-six unit with two turbochargers that offered more power than the M4 Competition Package. It was fitted to a standard 7-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox, and that was the only transmission available.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""M4 CS"",  ""year"": ""N/A"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""race-focused"", ""road car"", ""carbon-fiber"", ""specific features"", ""19” front, 20” back wheels""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""carbon-fiber""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""19” front, 20” back"", ""light-alloy"", ""Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires""],    ""doors"": [""race-inspired features"", ""comfort""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""lip-spoiler"", ""carbon-fiber"", ""fixed""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW iX3,"After a few years of innovations and experiments in electric mobility, BMW made another step and introduced the full-electric crossover iX3 in July 2020. The BMW i3 made part of its fans angry and the other ones happy. But the car sold well, and it allowed the German car-maker to understand the way people are using an electric vehicle. Meanwhile, the i3 provided valuable data for further developments of the electric mobility solution. And the first result of that experience was named iX3. Its look might resemble the BMW X3, and there was no coincidence since the well-known SUV was used as a base product for the electric vehicle. While the kidney-grille was more of a kidney-panel, since it was closed, the look was similar. There were only a few clues left from the profile, like the charging port door on the front fender. In the back, where the exhausts were placed on the X3, there were two blue trims. Inside, the instrument cluster featured a TFT display. The infotainment system was placed on top of the center stack on the dashboard in a floating design trend. The gear-selector was similar to the one found in an X3. By moving the selector from “D” to “B,” the car used the regenerative braking system to slow the vehicle, charging the batteries. Bucket seats were installed for the front occupants, and a two-passengers profiled rear bench was installed, but there was room for up to five people inside. The drivetrain used an electric motor to power the rear wheels only. The axle was specially developed and adapted for the existing X3 platform. All of the components were developed in-house by BMW, including the motor and the batteries. The 286 hp motor produced exactly the same output as the former BMW X3 3.0 SD.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""iX3"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""electric"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""sophisticated"", ""efficient""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""closed"", ""panel""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""front fender"", ""rear""],    ""roof"": [""floating design""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""blue trims""]  }}```"
BMW iX2,"BMW unveiled the all-electric version of the iX2 at the same time with the launch of the X2’s second generation in late 2023 for the 2024 model year. The competition for supremacy in the small-sized crossover market took place on all fronts, including in the EV segment. As a result, BMW created a platform that iX2 shared with its iX1 sibling. Thanks to its rapid evolution in the EV market, the German automaker was able to provide electron-powered vehicles in all segments and all of its products, which were either electrified or fully electric. The iX2 was the electric version of the X2, a sporty-looking four-door coupe SAV made by BMW. Thanks to its higher ground clearance than a regular sedan, the small-sized crossover coupe could also travel on unpaved roads. Unfortunately, the automaker didn’t offer this electric vehicle on the U.S. market. At the front, the car impressed with its front fascia, which represented another step in transforming one of the brand’s most notorious design themes, the kidney grille. Since an EV didn’t need such a broad cooling area, that element was actually a panel decorated with a rhomboidal mesh-like pattern and surrounded, as an option, with an LED rim. On the upper sides, it was flanked by the LED (optional adaptive LED) headlights with angular-shaped daytime running lights. On the lower side of the bumper, depending on the options, the iX2 featured a wide lower grille flanked by functional side scoops. From its profile, the iX2 featured a low greenhouse sloped back and continued by a raked forward tailgate. The tall door panels and narrow windows created a dynamic look for the vehicle, emphasized by the large, 20” alloy wheels. At the back, the iX2 featured a standard spoiler on the tailgate and also included the rearview camera. On the bumper, the automaker added black plastic cladding that concealed the car’s height and created the illusion of a higher ground clearance. Unlike other automakers, BMW didn’t put a massive fake diffuser there. BMW created a unique upholstery for the iX2 with so-called smoked-white artificial leather. In front of the driver, the automaker placed the digital instrument cluster that was extended atop the center stack by the touchscreen for the iDrive infotainment system. The automaker created a four-seat cabin with bolstered seats at the front and a split-folding (40/20/40) bench in the rear. Behind them, the iX2 boasted a 525-liter (18.5 cu-ft.), which was slightly smaller than the one from the internal-combustion X2 but still large enough for families. The iX2 was available from the start with an all-wheel-drive version named xDrive30, which included two motors, one for each axle. With a total output of 313 PS (308 hp), the smallest crossover coupe from BMW could accelerate from zero to 62 MPH (0-100 kph) in 5.6 seconds, onto a way to a capped top speed of 180 kph (112 MPH).",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""iX2"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""small-sized crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty-looking"", ""electric"", ""four-door coupe SAV""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""rhomboidal mesh-like"", ""LED-rimmed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angular-shaped"", ""LED"", ""adaptive LED""],    ""bumper"": [""wide lower grille"", ""functional side scoops"", ""black plastic cladding""],    ""wheel"": [""large 20” alloy""],    ""doors"": [""tall door panels"", ""narrow windows""],    ""roof"": [""low greenhouse"", ""raked forward tailgate""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""standard""],    ""exhaust"": [],    ""interior"": [""smoked-white artificial leather upholstery"", ""digital instrument cluster"", ""iDrive infotainment system"", ""four-seat cabin"", ""split-folding bench"", ""525-liter trunk""]  }}```"
BMW M8 Gran Coupe,"BMW started the 2022 year in full blast by launching a refreshed lineup for the 8-Series in all shapes and sizes, and the Gran Coupe in the M-Spec version also received an upgrade. While those oriented on speed and handling were more biased on purchasing the coupe version, there was a big market for high-performance four-door vehicles. That's why BMW and Mercedes-Benz brought back the four-door coupe styling initiated back in the '60s by the Mark III Rover P5. The M8 Gran Coupe shares its underpinning with its two-door, hard-top sibling, the M8. Yet, it boasts a longer wheelbase and could accommodate two passengers in the back. Like its sibling, it featured frame-less door windows, making it look sportier, but the B-pillar had to stay in place. At the front, the Gran Coupe offered the same front fascia as the non-facelifted version, with a wide, trapezoidal air intake on the lower apron flanked by two functional scoops that cooled the brakes. Inside, the most noticeable change was for the infotainment system, which received a 12.3"" touchscreen instead of the former 10.25"" one. There was also new hardware for it, allowing better integration with the smartphone. In addition, customers had the option to order it with either standard bucket seats or, as an option, carbon-fiber sport seats that enhanced the sporty character. The M8 Gran Coupe featured a split-folding bench fit for two at the back since there was a tall transmission tunnel that crossed the car from front to back. Under the hood, the Bavarian carmaker placed the same powerplant as the M8 Coupe mated to an eight-speed automatic gearbox that sent the power in all corners.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""M8 Gran Coupe"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""sleek"", ""high-performance"", ""four-door coupe"", ""refreshed""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""frame-less""],    ""grille"": [""trapezoidal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""wide""],    ""wheel"": [""large""],    ""doors"": [""four-door"", ""longer wheelbase""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual""]  }}```"
BMW X3 M,"BMW introduced a facelift for the X3's third generation in 2021, and, along with the rest of the range, it unveiled the life-cycle impulse for the X3 M. The X3 appeared on the market in 2003 as a compact SUV. While customers did not appreciate its Chris Bagle design styling, the vehicle's qualities convinced them. So, from the third generation, the German carmaker introduced a much-waited M version. At first, it was just the M 4.0i package from 2018, and then, the full M-version stormed the Autobahn with its 480 horses under the hood. The design team knew that it could do a better job for the 2017 X3. So, the compact SUV received an M Competition package that included a new front fascia with narrower headlights by 10 mm (0.4""), like the rest of the 2021 X3s. As an option, they could feature an adaptive LED with MATRIX function. Its grille was piano-black with vertical slats, which matched the apron's look. At the back, the X3 M Competition featured new LED taillights with a unique design and a diffuser under the bumper. BMW change the X3 M's interior with a new redesigned center console. It sported a new gear-selector, the i-Drive dial, and buttons. Above the center stack, the carmaker placed a 12"", wide-format touch-screen for the infotainment unit. The most significant change was on the digital instrument panel, which featured the Driving Assistant Professional as standard, which trained the driver. In addition, the new system allowed integration with Amazon Alexa via the My BMW app. Under the hood, BMW upgraded the 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six from the X3 M with a crankshaft carried over from the M4. Thus, it could increase the power and, as a result, it dropped the 0-62 mph run to 3.8 seconds.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""X3"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""compact"", ""sporty"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""aggressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""piano-black"", ""vertical slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""narrower"", ""adaptive LED"", ""MATRIX function""],    ""bumper"": [""diffuser""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""under the bumper""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""turbocharged"", ""inline-six""]  }}```"
BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe,"BMW introduced a four-door version of the 2 Series in 2019 based on the same platform as the Mini, trying to offer a luxurious vehicle in a compact format. The German automaker introduced the four-door coupe on the market at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show and shared its UKL2 with its taller sibling BMW 2 Series Active Tourer, the Mini Hatch, and the Mini Hatch 5-door. Unlike the regular 2 Series, which was a rear-wheel-driven vehicle, it was a youth-oriented, sporty-looking car made for those attracted by premium products. In addition, it offered powerful enough engines to make it capable of wearing the white-and-blue badge on the hood. From the outside, the 2 Series Gran Coupe looked like a mix between the luxurious 8 Series Gran Coupe and the 2 Series Active Tourer. Its front fascia featured the automaker’s redesigned kidney grille with angular shapes and chromed vertical slats. Its LED headlights were standard, and BMW offered customers the option for Adaptive LEDs. Depending on the trim level and options, the lower bumper sported a wide air intake in the middle flanked by a pair of side scoops, which were mostly used for decoration or to house the fog lamps. From its profile, the ascending waistline of the four-door 2 Series created a dynamic image for the car, while the sloped-down roof line emphasized the coupe styling. Inside, the car featured the new BMW Live Cockpit instrument cluster filled with a fully digital display. In addition, atop the center stack, the automaker placed a 10.25” screen for the BMW Operating System 7.0 infotainment unit, with gesture control. At the front, customers could choose between a set of regular seats or high-bolstered sports seats, depending on the engines and options. At the same time, in the back, passengers sat on a split-folding (40/20/40) bench seat that could expand the 430-liter (15.2 cu-ft) trunk. Thanks to the new platform, the cabin offered almost the same space as the car’s bigger sibling, the 3-Series. Surprisingly, the 2 Series Gran Coupe was available with a panoramic glass roof, an option unavailable for the 3- or the 5-Series sedan. Customers could order the car with either fabric or leather upholstery. Under the hood, BMW installed a choice of transversely mounted diesel and gasoline engines with three or four cylinders. The automaker paired them with either six-speed manuals or eight-speed automatics provided by Aisin. Depending on the engine version, the 2 Series Gran Coupe was available with either front- or all-wheel-drive systems. Furthermore, the sportiest version, the M235i xDrive, featured a torque-sensing differential on the front axle. Thanks to the independent suspension in all corners, the 2 Series Gran Coupe provided an excellent ride for its class.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""2 Series Gran Coupe"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""youth-oriented"", ""sporty-looking"", ""dynamic"", ""premium""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""angular"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [""sporty""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""Adaptive""],    ""bumper"": [""wide"", ""sporty""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""split-folding""],    ""roof"": [""sloped-down"", ""panoramic""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""torque-sensing""]  }}```"
BMW X4 M,"BMW introduced a life-cycle impulse for the X4 M Competition, and, as usual, it offered better performances and improved technologies to help the driver. There were times when the cars that could do a 0 to 60 mph run (0-97 kph) in under four seconds were supercars. It was the league of Ferrari F430 Challenge, Lamborghini Gallardo, or Porsche GT2. Yet, in 2021, BMW introduced the X4 M Competition, which could do the same in a daily-driver four-door SUV. When BMW introduced the facelifted version of the X3 and X4 in 2021, it also launched the M Competition models. For the X4 M, that was reflected in the car's look. At the front, it featured standard narrower headlights with adaptive LED with MATRIX function. A completely new black kidney grille with black vertical slats created a stronger image for the fastest X4 on sale at that time. At the sides, the exhaust vent behind the front wheels and the body-colored side sills were carried over from its predecessor, the X4 M. The rear bumper sported a new design with a piano-black apron that incorporated broader cuts for the free-floating pipes. Inside, there were two main areas changed. The carmaker introduced a new design for the center console, including a new gear-selector. A set of carbon-fiber trims adorned the center side of the dashboard and the door panels. BMW also introduced the Driving Assistant Professional as a standard feature, which trained the driver to better use the car either on track mode or on regular driving. Under the hood, BMW upgraded the 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six from the X4M with a crankshaft carried over from the M4. Thus, it could increase the power and, as a result, it dropped the 0-62 mph run to 3.9 seconds.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""X4 M Competition"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""four-door SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""sporty"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""powerful""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""narrower""],    ""grille"": [""black"", ""vertical""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""adaptive LED"", ""MATRIX function""],    ""bumper"": [""new design"", ""piano-black apron"", ""broader cuts""],    ""wheel"": [""sporty""],    ""doors"": [""carbon-fiber trims""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""free-floating pipes""]  }}```"
BMW i5,"The iconic 5 Series is now part of the BMW electric family. The first ever i5 comes as a green alternative to the usual 5 Series, a car that has been an excellent seller in recent decades. The i5 comes in two different versions, and one of them is the eDrive40 which has an electric motor capable of transmitting 340 hp to the car's rear wheels. The other is the flagship i5 M60 xDrive, the most potent 5 Series from the current generation. It has two integrated drive units on both axles to offer an electric all-wheel drive system. With the help of functions such as M Sport Boost and the M Launch Control, the BMW reaches 62 mph in an impressive 3.8 seconds. With a space-saving high-voltage battery with a capacity of 81.2 kWh, the BMW i5 has a range of over 300 miles (483 km) that can be extended by a further 25% with the new MAX RANGE function that limits power and speed and disables comfort functions. The extended range of the vehicle is also achieved through a combination of the latest adaptive recuperation system and intelligent utilization of heat pump technology for interior heating and cooling. Additionally, the drive system and high-voltage battery significantly maximize overall efficiency and performance. The BMW i5's Combined Charging Unit (CCU) offers standard AC charging with an output of up to 11 kW, which can be upgraded to 22 kW if desired. Regarding DC charging, the high-voltage battery can be charged with a power of up to 205 kW. To exemplify, the battery charge level in the BMW i5 can be increased from 10 to 80 percent in approximately 30 minutes. The new 5 Series electric models mark a significant milestone as the first vehicles from the BMW brand to support the Plug & Charge feature. This innovative functionality allows the vehicle to authenticate itself seamlessly at compatible public charging stations, eliminating the need for an app or charging card. With the fifth generation of the BMW eDrive technology, the vehicle offers one of the most comfortable driving experiences available on the market. The abundance of technology blends well with the quality of the materials used to enhance the feeling of luxury, providing the new i5 with an adequate title of a premium luxury electric sedan. The M badge underlines the car's racing pedigree and glimpses the high dynamic capability of the BMW. From a racing point of view, the four-wheel drive amplifies the vehicle's performance on wet and dry surfaces, making it suitable for both a relaxing evening drive where you enjoy the comfort and the luxury of the car and also for a little bit of fun on the empty streets, even on rain or snow.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""5 Series"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxury"", ""electric"", ""premium"", ""racing"", ""dynamic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""innovative""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""adaptive""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""space-saving""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW 1 Series Sedan,"BMW introduced the 1 Series Sedan for China and made a true contender for the Mercedes-Benz's CLA on the local market. While in the U.S. and Europe the Mercedes-Benz CLA was the only contender in the small-class premium segment, the BMW considered that it might be a good idea to challenge their traditional competitors only in China. The reason behind that decision was the half-of-million car sold in 2016 over there. Dr. Ian Robertson, BMW AG Management Board member responsible for Sales and Marketing BMW, stated that the Chinese customers asked for smaller vehicles, which were suited better in heavy traffic. Thanks to its front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, the carmaker was able to make the 1 Series sedan short but with a mid-size segment wheelbase. At the front, the aggressive look of the angled headlights and the wide ""kidney-grille"" were specific for the Bavarese brand. Its fluid lines, with curved and sculptured door panels, offered the same image of a bigger car, but in a smaller package. The 1 Series sedan featured a 3-Series style for the taillights and a tall trunk in the back. Depending on the engine version, it sported one or two exhausts at the bottom of the rear apron. Inside, the carmaker used the same parts and bits offered in the 1-Series hatchback. Its black dashboard with soft materials and the floating-type touch-screen above the center stack looked familiar for the entire BMW range from those times. Depending on the customer options and engine version, the carmaker offered a pair of standard bucket seats or sports seats, with cloth or leather upholstery. The bench was 40/20/40 split-folding, allowing the user to expand the trunk area. Under the hood, BMW installed a choice of three engines range between 136 hp and 231 hp. All versions were paired to automatic transmissions.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""1 Series Sedan"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""short, mid-size wheelbase"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""fluid"", ""curved"", ""sculptured"", ""compact""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wide"", ""specific""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angled""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""curved"", ""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""one or two at the bottom""]  }}```"
BMW iX1,"BMW introduced the first full-electric version of the X1 model, named it iX1 in 2022, and increased its presence on the EV market. After trials and errors, BMW finally looked like it had learned how to do electric vehicles properly. But the carmaker knew that it needed more cars on the same platform to cover the development costs, so the iX1 shared many of its components with gasoline, diesel, hybrid, and plug-in hybrid models. On the outside, the most significant changes made to the car to differentiate it from its IAC-powered cousins were the blue accents on various areas of the car located inside the side clusters on the lower bumper, the side sills, and the rear bumper. One important difference was on the grille that was completely shut. It looked more conventional than its bigger brother, the iX3. The car featured standard LED headlights or Adaptive LEDs as an option. At the back, the taillights sported the same L-shaped design pattern as the one found at the front. Inside, BMW installed a screen in front of the driver for the instrument panel and a touch-screen atop the center stack for the iDrive infotainment unit based on the BMW Operating System 8. They were covered by the same curved glass, creating the so-called BMW Curved Display. The raised seating position allowed enough room for up to five passengers to comfortably sit inside the cabin. But the most important difference between the iX1 and the rest of the X1 range was under the skin. BMW installed two electric motors that provided a total output of 230 kW (308 PS) and 494 Nm (364 lb-ft) of torque. The standard version came with an 11 kW AC charging port, while a 22 kW version was available as an option.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""X1"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""electric"", ""conventional"", ""curved"", ""spacious"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""shut"", ""conventional""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""Adaptive"", ""L-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [""blue accents"", ""lower placement""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW i7,"BMW introduced the i7 as a battery-electric (BEV) luxury sedan in 2022 for the 2023 model year, completely changing the pace for its flagship 7 Series model. The German automaker was among the frontrunners of the electric car revolution when it introduced the i3 in 2013. Even though that was a small-sized vehicle, it paved the way and helped BMW research this new area, where it had little experience. But it recovered sooner than anyone expected. Fast forward nine years, and the carmaker already had a line of electric vehicles, including the luxurious flagship i7. While some might argue that the kidney grille is too big or too wide, the automaker considered that it was just about the right size. On the sides flanking it, BMW installed the daytime running lights while the headlights were placed lower, featuring adaptive LEDs with an option for crystals from Swarovski. The lower side of the bumper was dominated on the left and right by massive air scoops that channeled the air toward the sides of the vehicle. From its profile, the i7 featured a sloped rear windscreen and a tall deck at the back. As expected, the taillights sported LEDs and no tailpipes. Inside, the i7 boasted a luxurious cabin that provided plenty of space for four adults. At the front, the dashboard featured a display for the instrument panel and a touchscreen above the center stack. Both were covered by the same piece of glass, creating the image of a single unit. In addition, the i7 featured the iDrive 8 system, providing advanced connectivity technologies and more functions than the previous unit. For the rear-seat passengers, BMW installed a 31.3-inch, 8K touchscreen, the biggest in the automotive industry. That could've been controlled via 5.5"" touch controllers integrated into the rear doors. Under the skin, the i7 was fitted with two electric motors with a total output of 400 kW. These sent their power to both axles.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""i7"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""luxury sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""electric"", ""spacious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""large"", ""wide""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""adaptive"", ""LED"", ""crystal option""],    ""bumper"": [""dominated by air scoops""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""integrated 5.5\"" touch controllers""],    ""roof"": [""tall deck at the back""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW iX,"BMW came late to the electric-SUV revolution, but it didn't come empty-handed. It brought a vehicle that could match, and overtake, most of its competition. When Tesla stormed the automotive industry with the Roadster, there were just a few to see the revolution that was about to happen. As the electric car interest started to rise, the big carmakers began to research and develop new products. BMW's first strike was the i3, and it announced that the BMW-i would become a separate, electric, brand. In 2020, it showed its next product, the iX. Love-it or hate-it! That was what BMW might have said when it showed the vehicle with the massive grille at the front. The big kidneys were useless, apart from the aesthetic purpose. The narrow LED headlights formed a frontal fascia that resembled one of the Transformers robots. The overall shape resembled other X-models from the German carmaker's lineup. Inside, BMW installed a futuristic, sloped dashboard, which inspired more of a concept-car than a production vehicle. The curving, one-piece display served as the central control element reinterpreting BMW cockpits' traditional driver-centric design. That was made by bringing together the 12.3-inch Information Display and the Control Display with its screen diagonal of 14.9 inches to form a single unit angled towards the driver. The front seats featured integrated headrests for more comfort for their occupants. In the back, a 40:20:40 bench with a three-way split-folding seatback was installed to increase the trunk area. BMW powered the iX with 500 hp electric motors that. The big battery pack installed inside the floor offered a 600 km (372 miles) range.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""iX"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""futuristic"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""aggressive"", ""bold""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""narrow""],    ""grille"": [""massive""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""narrow"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BMW XM,"BMW introduced the XM in 2023 as a full-size luxurious, sporty SUV that was also the most powerful production model made by the German automaker. While the Motorsport division was created in the '70s to create and develop sports cars, over time, that evolved into a department that improved standard BMW models. Besides the M models, the M-Performance packages were made available for the rest of the cars sold by the car manufacturer. But the XM was developed from the ground up to become a serious contender in the performance-SUV category. With an exterior design that resembled the iX lineup, the XM's look was different. At the front, the grille wasn't tall and narrow but wide and shorter. In addition, the angular shapes of the vehicles replaced the fluid lines of other M models. Even the lower grille sported straight lines instead of curved ones. From its profile, the SUV's massive size was emphasized by the large 21"" wheels and the angular shapes of the wheel arches. Furthermore, a chromed trim surrounded the windows' area. An unusual detail was noticed at the back of the car, where the automaker installed the four hexagonal exhausts stacked two-by-two on each side of the vehicle. The car's interior was luxurious, with a sporty touch for the front bucket seats. On the dashboard, BMW installed a wide, curved glass panel that covered the dials in front of the driver and the iDrive infotainment's screen placed atop the center stack. The angular shapes of the exterior were also seen inside, especially on the vents and the headliner. A twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V8 powered the 2.7-ton vehicle. The ICE was also helped by a 197 hp motor integrated into the eight-speed automatic transmission. As expected, the massive combined torque of 590 lb-ft (800 Nm) was sent into all corners. A 29.5 kWh battery pack helped the big SUV travel up to 82 km (51 miles) with zero tailpipe emissions.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""XM"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""full-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""angular"", ""massive"", ""chromed""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wide"", ""shorter""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""large 21\"""", ""angular wheel arches""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""four hexagonal"", ""stacked two-by-two""],  }}```"
BMW iX M,"The iX M60 heralds a new era for M since it is the first vehicle designed and engineered by the BMW M automobile as a purely electric vehicle right from the start. The M department started its journey half a century ago, and most of its products were based on regular BMW cars. It was just a matter of time until it started to improve the overall performances of the carmaker's crossovers, named SAV – or Sport Activity Vehicles. The well-known X5 was the first to receive such a treatment. But this time, it all began with a blank sheet of paper. With all the evolution toward crossovers and SUVs on the market and the electric-car revolution started, it was just normal that BMW M would start making one. The iX M60 was unveiled at the beginning of 2022 and offered the highest torque available for an M-powered vehicle in history. The design kept the same controversial front fascia with the vertical kidney-grille in the middle. Its length was comparable to an X5 and the width to an X7, while the height was lower than any of them. Its roofline resembled the X6, but it was not that much sloped as on its sibling. Despite its massive appearance, the car was actually light thanks to the extensive use of CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic) integrated into the safety cell, roof, and pillars. Inside, thanks to the lack of transmission tunnel, the carmaker was able to create more legroom and add more storage areas. Its seats were multicontour, designed for comfort, but also with high bolstered areas for increased support during high-speed cornering. Like other BMWs from its time, it sported the BMW Operating System 8 for the iDrive. A wide and curved display sat on the dashboard, as a floating glass panel, integrating the instrument cluster and the touch-screen for the infotainment unit.",BMW,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""iX M60"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""comparable to X5 in length, X7 in width, lower height than both"",  ""overall-design"": [""controversial front fascia"", ""massive appearance"", ""lightweight due to CFRP""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""vertical kidney-grille""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""resembles X6 roofline""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BRISTOL Bullet,"The Bristol Cars Limited was founded in 1945 when the already existing Bristol Aeroplane Company started a car division. The Bullet was launched to celebrate the British company’s 70 years anniversary and it was the manufacturer’s first new design in 12 years. The exterior design gracefully combined retro with futuristic lines, still reminding us of the 60s’ European sports cars. The front featured classical round headlamps, round foglamps, a big grille in the middle and muscular front fenders. The rear fascia featured a clean bumper and a dual exhaust. The Bullet’s body wwwas made entirely from carbon fiber and the materials used were of premium quality and provided a modern feel throughout the vehicle. The cabin was fitted with a classic design, with leather all around, on the dashboard, the seats, the steering wheel, the gear knob and the hand level, as well as the door panels. The chrome accents used defined the luxurious interior. The Bullet was equipped with powerful engine that cranked out 370 hp and was mated with a ZF 6-speed automatic transmission that sent the power to the rear wheels. In the sprint to 100 km/h, the Bullet took only 3.8 seconds, showing its true sports car nature. The starting price was around $330,000 and its production was limited to 70 units, with all vehicle being hand built.",BRISTOL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Bullet"",  ""year"": ""70th anniversary"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""retro"", ""futuristic"", ""muscular"", ""luxurious"", ""limited""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""big""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""classical"", ""round""],    ""bumper"": [""clean""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual""]  }}```"
BUFORI Geneva,"The Malaysian car manufacturer Bufori unveiled the Geneva four-door luxury sedan at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show in Europe, trying to compete against prestigious luxury carmakers. A name and a heritage cannot be bought, which many people couldn't understand. Still, they tried to push carefully handcrafted products on the market. Sometimes, their strategy worked, while other times, it didn't. But that didn't stop the small carmaker Bufori from trying and working hard to offer a vehicle that aimed at the same customers as Rolls-Royce or Bentley. Each of the Geneva, or the Mark VI as it was also known, needed 9,000 man-hours to build, and the attention to detail was incredible. The Malaysian car manufacturer created a neoclassic design inspired by the 1930's cars, fitted with arched front fenders that flanked a narrower and taller engine compartment. Moreover, Bufori didn't use regular steel for creating the bodywork but woven fabric reinforced with Kevlar and carbon fiber. That gave the vehicle an unusual strength and a lighter weight when compared with regular steel panels. The car's profile revealed tall side sills that opened together with the doors. Like the '30s cars, the rear doors were rear-hinged to allow easier ingress and egress. At the back, the sloped-down trunk also included a drawer for smaller items. Thanks to its huge wheelbase, the interior was very roomy. Bufori used only the highest quality materials when it created it, with hand-stitched leather upholstery and even 24-carat gold-plated dials. Yet, the high-tech amenities were not left aside, and the car featured three touchscreens: on the center stack and two others on the back of the front seats' headrests. In addition, the carmaker even offered an option for a coffee machine or instant boiling water for tea. Under the hood, Bufori opted for a Chrysler-sourced 6.1-liter Hemi engine paired with a five-speed automatic gearbox. Later on, the powerplant was replaced by a newer 6.4-liter unit.",BUFORI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Geneva"",  ""year"": ""2010"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""neoclassic"", ""luxurious"", ""handcrafted"", ""roomy"", ""sophisticated""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""tall""],    ""grille"": [""elegant""],    ""hood"": [""arched""],    ""headlights"": [""sleek""],    ""bumper"": [""sophisticated""],    ""wheel"": [""huge""],    ""doors"": [""rear-hinged"", ""roomy""],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BUFORI La Joya,"Built in Malaysia by a local company, the Bufori brand launched the third model with a touch of expensive materials, including a 24k gold badge on the hood. Even if it sounds like a fairy tale, it isn't. Gerry, George, and Anthony Khouri were three brothers. Gerri decided to build three cars for himself and his brothers. He was inspired by some '30s American roadsters and built the first model, named Madison, in 1986. Surprisingly, he was asked if he couldn't make more for other eccentric locals. Soon, from a small shop, the Bufori brand grew and had over 100 employees. In 2004, the carmaker built the La Joya model. The car was designed as a small coupe inspired by former American cars produced between WWI and WWII. It sported large fenders that covered the wheels and a narrower engine compartment with side-opened panels and louvers. Its bumper was made from tubular elements mounted at the front, directly on the chassis endings. A pinned-out mesh-grille mimicked the same old vehicles from the La Belle Epoque era. Unlike its predecessors, the La Joya was a coupe with a rounded roof and a sloped rear end. The trunk featured a very wide lid. Worth mentioning that the carmaker built the bodywork from carbon fiber and kevlar materials. Inside, the leather and wood veneers were manually crafted, and that led to high-quality products. Its cabin offered room just for two occupants, separated by a tall center console and a folding armrest. Bufori installed a 2.7-liter Audi engine under the hood, paired with a standard six-speed manual or a four-speed automatic gearbox with sequential manual override.",BUFORI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""La Joya"",  ""year"": ""2004"",  ""size"": ""small coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""expensive"", ""retro"", ""luxurious"", ""sleek"", ""compact""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""rounded""],    ""grille"": [""mesh"", ""vintage""],    ""hood"": [""gold"", ""ornate""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""tubular""],    ""wheel"": [""covered""],    ""doors"": [""side-opened""],    ""roof"": [""rounded""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""standard""]  }}```"
BUGATTI Chiron,"With a top speed of 300 mph (490.484 kph), this is not only the fastest Bugatti ever built, but also the fastest production car on the planet as of September 2019. The heavily modified Bugatti Chiron received a longer back and some extra power from the engine. Also, the “Longtail” back has an important role for aerodynamic efficiency. Longer, meaner and more powerful, the Chiron Super Sport 300+ was specifically built for the 300 mph car title, and has taken the crown. Also, it is considered a production car, not a unique model, which makes the prize even more valuable. The modified W16, 8-cylinder engine with four turbochargers develops 1578 hp. Since more internal components are carried-over from the Centodieci (110) model, the gearbox and transmission are the same, with an 8-speed automatic gearbox and all-wheel-drive. An interesting fact is that Bugatti made a record-run with the prototype at 304 mph, it then installed a 300 mph speed limiter for the production model. Only 30 units will be made, with the first one having been sold right when the car was launched. The customer actually signed the papers on top of the first car's roof. The launch of this new model was showcased with the occasion of the finale of the Grand Tour, a rally that payed an homage to Ettore Bugatti's life, from Milan to Paris via Molsheim.

BUGATTI La Voiture Noire,"At the 2019 Geneva Motor Show, the exclusive super-car manufacturer Bugatti brought a new model, called “Le Voiture Noire” (The black car). This is a one of a kind car, and it was already sold for 11 million (plus taxes) euros before it was even showed. The “La Voiture Noire” is an homage to the mighty Bugatti 57 SC Atlantic. It is bigger than the well known Chiron but shares the same engine. With the new model, Bugatti shows a connection with its tradition as a coach-builder. This new vehicle was ordered after the Chiron model was shown and one special Bugatti enthusiast wanted a one of a kind vehicle. The “La Voiture Noire” is the answer. The model's new bodywork was specially designed to resemble the mighty 57 SC Atlantic but from a modern perspective. The sloped rear end and the flared rear-wheels arches are also inspired by the famous Bugatti supercar from the '40s. With a reshaped bodywork and the same powerful engine, the unique model is the most expensive new car ever. With the same money, you could have bought 20 Rolls-Royce cars with some options. The engine is a W16-cylinder with an 8.0-liter displacement and four turbochargers. The total output is 1600 HP and the transmission uses the same double-clutch system as the Chiron. The performance numbers were not communicated officially but we would bet for some figures close to Chiron's.",BUGATTI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""La Voiture Noire"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""Bigger than Chiron"",  ""overall-design"": [""Sleek"", ""Modern"", ""Powerful"", ""Expensive"", ""Unique""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""Sloped""],    ""grille"": [""Distinctive""],    ""hood"": [""Reshaped""],    ""headlights"": [""Sleek""],    ""bumper"": [""Modern""],    ""wheel"": [""Flared""],    ""doors"": [""Custom""],    ""roof"": [""Smooth""],    ""diffusor"": [""Aerodynamic""],    ""spoiler"": [""Integrated""],    ""exhaust"": [""Dual""]  }}```"
BUGATTI Bolide,"When Bugatti tried to create an extreme version of the Chiron, this is how the result looked, and, in addition, it was built according to FIA's racing regulations. Bugatti's name is linked with a glorious motorsports history that included two wins at the fantastic Le Mans race in 1937 and 1939. However, over time, the French brand fell. It was almost dead when it was resurrected by Romano Artioli in the early '90s when the car manufacturer produced the EB-110. Later, in 1998, Bugatti was acquired by Volkswagen Group, which gave it back its glory with the mighty Veyron, followed by the Chiron and Divo. In 2020, the automaker digitally showed the Bolide, which took shape as a real car in 2021 at the Milano Motor Show. The vehicle was designed around the mighty quad-turbocharged W16 engine. Its bodywork was completely made from carbon fiber, and it featured active aerodynamics. This allowed a downforce of up to 1,800 kg (3,968 lbs) for the rear axle and 800 kg (1,763 lbs) on the front axle when speeding at 320 kph (199 mph). The hypercar weighed just a mere 1,240 kg (2,734 lbs), meaning that it could match the performance of a Formula 1 car. Yet unlike those race-cars, it could go with up to 500 kph (310.6 mph). As a result, it could lap the Le Mans racetrack in 3.07:1 minutes. While most other vehicles produced by Bugatti boasted luxurious features, the only allowance for the Bolide was a cockpit for two occupants. It was fitted with two race seats, which allowed HANS installment. Everything was track-focused, and no detail was left aside. For instance, all the car's screws were made from titanium. When it used 110 RON race fuel, the eight-liter powerplant produced 1,850 PS (1,825 hp) and 1,850 Nm (1,364 lb-ft) of torque. With 98 RON fuel, those figures decreased to 1,600 PS (1,578 hp) and 1,600 Nm (1,180 lb-ft) of torque. Power went in all corners via an especially designed seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox.",BUGATTI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Bugatti Bolide"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""hypercar"",  ""overall-design"": [""track-focused"", ""aerodynamic"", ""lightweight"", ""powerful"", ""aggressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""carbon fiber""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""race-focused""],    ""roof"": [""carbon fiber""],    ""diffusor"": [""active aerodynamics""],    ""spoiler"": [""track-oriented""],    ""exhaust"": [""quad-turbocharged""]  }}```"
BUGATTI Centodieci,"Bugatti is more than a car-manufacturer. It offers the most expensive vehicle that someone can buy as a new vehicle in the current market. After doing one special project, the Bugatti La Voiture Noire in one unit, the only French brand under the Volkswagen group decided to work on a limited series of 10 units of another special vehicle. It is called the Centodieci (One hundred and ten) and it is a double homage to the founder of the company and to the EB110, the car that brought back the Bugatti name on the market 110 years after Ettore Bugatti's birthday, in 15th of September 1990. The front of the car resembles the front of the EB110, but in a new interpretation and keeping up with the new needs of a modern hypercar. The bigger vents, larger air-intakes and a taller central “keyhole” are very easy to suggest the connection with the EB110. In the rear, a bigger wing resembles the aerodynamic element from the EB110SS. The taillights have an aerodynamic role to redirect air from the big W16 engine. The 8.0-liter quad-turbo gasoline engine offers 1600 hp, 100 more than the Chiron, upon which the Centodieci is based. The transmission is a dual-clutch 7-speed gearbox, which sends the power to an all-wheel-drive system. The sprint from 0 to 100 kph (62 mph) is done in 2.4 seconds while the 0-300 kph (186.4 mph) acceleration takes just 13.1 seconds. The price tag is a cool 8 million euros. All of the 10 units have been sold.",BUGATTI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Centodieci"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""expensive"", ""modern"", ""aerodynamic"", ""limited"", ""powerful""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""tall""],    ""grille"": [""bigger"", ""modern""],    ""hood"": [""sleek""],    ""headlights"": [""new interpretation""],    ""bumper"": [""larger""],    ""wheel"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""doors"": [""limited""],    ""roof"": [""sleek""],    ""diffusor"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""spoiler"": [""bigger""],    ""exhaust"": [""quad-turbo""]  }}```"
BUGATTI Divo,"When the Chiron was launched, a lot of people asked if the Bugatti will build something even faster. With the 2018 Divo, it did, but in a different way Most of the vehicles produced by Bugatti after the Veyron were faster than the model it replaced. By faster, meaning higher top speed. But that wasn't the goal for the Divo. But still, it was faster. For the outside design, the car kept the main cues of the brand: a horse-shoe on the front with a large grille, a C-shaped side air-scoops and a long cabin that melted, visually the cockpit with the engine bay. The front had few air-intakes more and a new air-outlet on the hood was used to help to cool the front radiator. For the performance point of view, the goal was to make the Divo faster than the Chiron on a race-track. And it proved that it can. Even though both had the same engine and transmission, the Divo was able to turn faster. Thanks to its improved aerodynamic and to the huge rear-wing, it had a negative aerodynamic, which means that the faster it goes, the more force is put on the road. But on a static measurement, the Divo was 35 kg (77 lbs) lighter than the Chiron. Both the Chiron and the Divo also had the same tires and those were rated to a certain speed with a certain weight. Since the aerodynamic pressure was 90 kg (198 lbs) bigger on the Divo than on its older brother, the manufacturer didn't want to risk and limited the car to a maximum 380 kph (236 mph).",BUGATTI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Divo"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""fast"", ""aerodynamic"", ""sleek"", ""aggressive"", ""distinctive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""large""],    ""grille"": [""horse-shoe"", ""large""],    ""hood"": [""air-outlet""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""huge""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BUGATTI Mistral,"Bugatti introduced another masterpiece of a hypercar in 2022 and offered a multi-million-dollar vehicle for those who could handle the power of a quad-turbocharged W16 engine. The French brand was already in the same boat with the Croatian manufacturer Rimac when it revealed the Mistral. It was unveiled by the company's new CEO, Mate Rimac, who created the most powerful and quickest electric car in the world, the Nevera. He even announced that the Mistral would be the last W16 Bugatti. The Croatian CEO brought fresh ideas when he took over the Bugatti's helm. Thus, he understood that the brand needed a new, astonishing design, leading to the open-top Mistral. With its unique-looking LED headlights and the sculptured front end, the hypercar still featured the horseshoe-shaped center grille flanked by wide air-intakes that cooled the front brakes and helped the car's aerodynamic. From its profile, the Mistral featured a raked windshield and narrowed down side windows. Behind the cabin, the automaker created a taller structure that concealed the safety arches and the engine's air intake. At the back, the taillights looked like two arrows pointing towards the car's center. Inside, the leather-clad cabin featured two seats separated by a tall center console and a sloped center stack. In addition, carbon-fiber elements decorated the interior and the door cards. The sports seats featured cutouts for a race harness, even though the car was mostly designed for street use, not for racing. Even though it could race faster than most of the cars on the planet. Behind the cockpit, Bugatti installed its famous W16, a quad-turbocharged powerplant that was carried over from the Chiron. Its immense power and torque were sent in all corners of the car via a seven-speed automatic transmission.",BUGATTI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mistral"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""unique"", ""astonishing"", ""sculptured"", ""raked"", ""taller""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [""horseshoe-shaped""],    ""hood"": [""sculptured""],    ""headlights"": [""unique-looking"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""wide air-intakes""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""leather-clad""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BUICK Encore,"Buick refreshed the Encore lineup for the 2024 model year and added significant styling changes and cabin upgrades for the small-sized crossover vehicle. Based on the same platform as the Chevrolet Trailblazer (with the small b in its name), the Encore aimed at the premium segment with a product that could've been ordered with front or all-wheel drive. Moreover, the technological upgrades made by Buick on this car pleased the deep-pocket buyers, even though the car's price was actually lower than on the 2023 version. The exterior featured LED headlights that resembled wings and were seen for the first time on the Wildcat EV concept car. Also, on the front fascia, the broad grille was hosted on the lower bumper and was adorned with chromed surrounding. Buick also offered the vehicle with LED taillights, depending on the trim level. It also added gloss black front and rear bumpers. Inside, the automaker ditched the analog instrument cluster. It replaced it with an 8"" configurable display. Furthermore, atop the center stack, the carmaker installed an 11"" touchscreen that featured Android Auto and Wireless Apple CarPlay. Another essential upgrade for the car was the introduction of higher-quality materials for the upholstery. For the drivetrain, Buick offered a choice of two turbocharged gasoline engines, which were paired with either a CVT or a nine-speed automatic. Power went to the front or all wheels, regardless of the trim level.",BUICK,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Encore"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""small-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""premium"", ""stylish"", ""technological"", ""lower-priced""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""wing-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [""gloss black"", ""lower""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BUICK Envision,"The 2024 Buick Envision is the facelift of the model's second generation. The crossover SUV appeared on the market in 2014 as a vehicle destined for the North American and Chinese markets. Buick, the self-claimed fastest-growing mainstream brand in the U.S. at the time of the announcement of the new model, hopes to keep the ball rolling with the release of the Envision and four other models throughout the year 2024. General Motors has opted for a daring design for the Buick Envision as it borrows structural elements from the concept car Wildcat EV. The redesigned front grille and front fascia help the crossover SUV obtain a futuristic look. The upgraded hood complements the design changes from the front part of the vehicle to provide a complete visual package. As a signature, a body-mounted emblem makes the Buick easily recognizable. To complement the exterior upgrades, the 2024 Envision also has a refreshed interior that provides a new design for customers. As the steps towards the future aren't only from an aesthetic point of view, the new Envision provides one of the most up-to-date navigation experiences available on the market, GM's Super Cruise. There are over 400,000 mapped miles of road in the US and Canada where drivers can use this hands-free driving assistance system. Under suitable conditions and with an attentive driver, Super Cruise has the capability to allow hands-free operation of the vehicle. Working in conjunction with Adaptive Cruise Control, this advanced technology takes control of acceleration and braking, maintaining a driver-selected following distance when engaged and active. Thanks to Lane Change on Demand and Automatic Lane Change, even changing lanes is hands-free. The 2024 Buick Envision represents a step in the modernization process of the brand and displays some of the best features offered to its customers. The automaker also hopes to keep the sales numbers raised through attractive vehicles with innovative technologies.",BUICK,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Buick Envision"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""futuristic"", ""refreshed"", ""modern"", ""attractive"", ""innovative""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""redesigned"", ""daring""],    ""hood"": [""upgraded"", ""complementary""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BUICK Enclave,"Buick planned on launching the refreshed Enclave in 2020, but the pandemic situation forced the American carmaker to delay that to the summer of 2021 as a 2022 model year. The carmaker kept its promise to offer a premium vehicle at a bargain price compared to the European competitors. That didn't mean that it lowered the quality of its features. Buick built it smarter. It shared its platform with the Chevrolet Traverse and GMC Acadia. It's like getting to KFC, ask for two buckets, and then split it in three. But the Enclave was more of a Red Lobster meal than a chicken and threatened its main competitors with a seven-seat interior packed with more technologies. On the outside, the design team worked harder at the SUV's front fascia. It reshaped the grille and improved the headlights. Buick's engineers helped with the automatic high-beam feature. The Enclave kept the same wave-shaped sculptured doors and fenders and revealed new light-alloy wheels on its sides. At the back, the biggest SUV from Buick's lineup sported redesigned taillights, with a straight chromed slat connecting them over the tailgate. Inside, the carmaker offered an infotainment unit with standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. A new trim level, named Avenir, pampered its seven occupants with a leather-clad interior, two sunroofs, and massage for the front heated and ventilated front seats. Under the hood, the carmaker installed an enhanced 3.6-liter V-6 powerplant that produced 210 hp and was paired with a nine-speed automatic gearbox. The all-wheel-drive system was available but not standard.",BUICK,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Enclave"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""sophisticated"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""reshaped"", ""improved""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""enhanced""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [""wave-shaped"", ""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BUICK LaCrosse,"Since nine out of ten customers picked the two top trim levels for the LaCrosse, Buick dared for more and introduced an upscale version named Avenir for the 2017 model year. Based on the same platform as the Chevrolet Impala and the Opel/Vauxhall Insignia, the third generation of the LaCross was launched at the 2015 LA Auto Show. At first sight, it was a welcomed new generation of this stylish mid-size sedan. In addition, the automaker offered the Avenir version, which tried to get a slice of the luxury car market. Unfortunately for Buick, the LaCrosse didn't last too long, and by 2019 it was withdrawn from the assembly lines in the U.S. Still, it continued to be produced in China for that market. The car's exterior design was attractive. Its headlights featured upside-down L-shaped LED daytime running lights on the narrow headlights. They flanked the wide and tall metallic mesh grille that sported the Buick's badge. From its profile, the chromed surroundings for the windows and the sculptured line that emerged from the rear doors to the quarter panels gave the vehicle a muscular look but not aggressive. On the rear fascia, the automaker kept the same shape for the taillights as for the DRLs. Inside, the wide cabin boasted luxurious amenities and modern technologies. The instrument cluster featured analog dials and a TFT display for the onboard computer data. In addition, atop the center stack, Buick placed a touchscreen for the infotainment system that supported Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Between the front bucket seats on the center console, the automaker installed the shifter, which was blamed by many customers who didn't enjoy its functionality. They were used with the PRND sliders, not with sequential movement. And that damaged sales. In 2015, for the 2017 model-year, Buick offered eight-speed automatic transmissions supplied by Aisin, and for the 2018 model-year, it replaced that with a nine-speed gearbox. But that didn't help to save the model.",BUICK,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""LaCrosse"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""stylish"", ""muscular"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wide"", ""tall"", ""metallic""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""narrow"", ""upside-down L-shaped"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BUICK Regal,"The sixth generation of the Regal was introduced in 2017 as a 2018 model-year, and it was based on the same platform as the European Opel/Vauxhall Insignia. The Regal GS was a new addition to the American brand. Its fresh design was on par with other premium automakers from the same era and targeted families that didn't want to drive the commonly used Camry, Avalon, or Accord. Moreover, Buick offered the Regal with an all-wheel drive system, which was not available for its main competitors. Only the European premium automaker had something like this in their offer. When it developed the Regal, General Motors invested more than pennies into the car's look. The car's angular headlights flanked a broad black grille where the Buick badge took center stage. In addition, the front bumper sported large side scoops that flanked a slim lower air intake. From its profile, the Regal revealed its European connection due to its sculptured door panels. At the back, the sloped rear windscreen was integrated into the tailgate. Finally, the rear fascia featured angular, slim taillights. Inside, the automaker offered a pair of high-bolstered seats fitted as standard, with an option for sports seats. Like most other premium vehicles from the same segment, the GS sported an LCD placed in front of the driver and a second touch-screen panel atop the center stack. But Buick didn't forget about the trunk either. Thus, that could have been expanded from 490 liters (17.3 cu-ft) to 1,450 liters (51.2 cu-ft) by folding the rear bench seatback. Under the hood, Buick offered the Regal with a choice of two gasoline units; a 2.0-liter turbocharged-four or a 3.6-liter V6 paired with a nine-speed gearbox that sent the power in all corners.",BUICK,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Regal"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""Midsize"",  ""overall-design"": [""Fresh"", ""Angular"", ""Sculptured"", ""Sloped"", ""Sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""Sloped""],    ""grille"": [""Broad"", ""Black""],    ""hood"": [""Angular""],    ""headlights"": [""Angular""],    ""bumper"": [""Large"", ""Sporty""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""Sculptured""],    ""roof"": [""Sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BUICK Envista,"Buick introduced the Envista crossover in the Spring of 2023 as its last ICE-powered vehicle ever to be developed, promising that it will join the EV bandwagon from there on. GM had accelerated its conversion towards an all-electric lineup, and the Envista was the last Buick to sport a gas-powered powerplant under its hood. In addition, the new model was based on the same platform as the Chevrolet Traxx and was designed with a coupe-like shape to make it more appealing for sedan buyers who were reluctant to step inside a crossover. Buick installed a front fascia that looked very similar to some electric vehicles, albeit it featured a broad grille installed on the lower side of the bumper. Its slim LED headlights and the vertical scoops from the sides tried to create a sporty look for the Envista. From its profile, Buick's crossover showed its sculptured doors and the sloped-down tailgate. Finally, at the back, the carmaker added narrow LED taillights. Inside, the American brand tried to remind customers that it is a luxury brand and focused on technology and high-quality materials. The dashboard was rounded and supported a massive, wide dual-screen display, with a TFT in front of the driver for the instrument panel and a touchscreen atop the center stack for the infotainment system. Buick offered the Envista with three trims: Preferred, Sport Touring (ST), and Avenir. Since the subcompact crossover was a five-door affair, the rear bench was split-folding and could expand the trunk's area. GM installed a 1.2-liter, inline-three engine under Envista's hood and mated it to a standard six-speed automatic. And, despite the car's crossover shape, it was available only as a front-wheel drive affair.",BUICK,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Envista"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""subcompact"",  ""overall-design"": [""coupe-like shape"", ""luxury interior"", ""sporty profile""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""slim""],    ""grille"": [""broad""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""slim"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""lower-mounted""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
BUICK Regal Sportback,"GM introduced the 2018 Buick Regal Sportback at the GM's Design Dome in April 2017. It was based on the second generation of the European Opel/Vauxhall Insignia. The North-American and the Chinese market well received the fifth generation of the Buick Regal. It was unveiled in 2008 and updated in 2013 as a 2014 model year. Four years after the facelift, the car was replaced by the sixth generation of the Regal Sportback. The Sportback version replaced the older sedan model. While the roofline remained almost the same with a curved and sloped back, the designers installed a raked tailgate instead of the regular trunk lid. That added more utility to the premium, mid-sized vehicle. The car's look resembled more of a four-door coupe than a sedan. The engineers installed LED daytime running lights and LED taillights on the vehicle. The interior offered room for up to five adult passengers, and the rear headroom was increased due to the new silhouette. The designers re-arranged the instrument cluster. It still featured the TFT color-display in the middle, between the tachometer and speedometer, but the fuel level gauge and the coolant temperature dial were moved on top of the small screen. The infotainment display found a better integration into the dashboard and didn't have the same floating appearance as before. Under the hood, the engineers carried-over the 2.0-liter from the previous generation but upgraded to 250 hp. They added a new version with a 3.6-liter V6, which was offered exclusively with an all-wheel-drive system.",BUICK,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Buick Regal Sportback"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""mid-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""curved"", ""sloped"", ""premium"", ""four-door coupe"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""daytime running""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""raked tailgate"", ""utility"", ""sloped back""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CADILLAC CT5,"Cadillac refreshed the CT5's range for the 2025 model year. While it slightly improved the car's exterior look and installed a technologically advanced infotainment system, GM didn't modify the engine lineup. The luxurious American brand had to replace the former CTS lineup in 2019 since it became obsolete and uninteresting for its customers. Fortunately, with that model, it managed to attract younger buyers to the brand. They were more focused on technology and performance than on luxury features and amenities offered by the former DeVille and Eldorado models. As a result, the CT5 competed against premium European vehicles such as the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. Furthermore, with the available all-wheel-drive systems, it successfully faced the Audi A4 quattro versions. Fast forward to 2023, and the CT5 become more attractive to the brand's buyers thanks to the new technologies that GM installed in the vehicle. There was no need for significant upgrades for the car's exterior since customers liked it. Still, GM considered refreshing the front fascia by adding a new lower and wider grille. It was complemented by a new bumper fitted with a light-gray slim lip spoiler at the bottom. To create an even stronger sport sedan look, the automaker introduced new LED headlights with a new stack-up signature lighting for the daytime running lights that flanked the front fascia. From its profile, the fastback shape remained the same, but its wheels got a new design that made the car look sportier. Depending on the version, customers could get the car with a rear deck spoiler and four rectangular exhausts that peaked underneath the bumper, flanking the rear diffuser. Customers found the most significant upgrade for the vehicle in the cabin. GM installed a wide 33"" display on the dashboard. It arranged the instrument cluster and the touchscreen for the infotainment system under the same curved piece of glass on top of the dashboard. The new infotainment unit featured 5G Wi-Fi hotspot capability, running on Google technology. Between the front seat occupants, Cadillac installed a center console that housed the gear selector, the rotary knob for driving modes, and the one for the infotainment unit. In addition, a center armrest concealed a storage compartment. Behind, on the split-folding bench, the automaker made room for up to three passengers. However, the middle-seated one had to deal with the tall center tunnel that limited their legroom. Under the hood, GM used the same engine lineup as on the 2020 CT5. Customers had to choose between a 2.0-liter turbocharged unit and a 3.0-liter twin-turbo powerplant. Both versions were paired to a ten-speed automatic gearbox that sent the power in all corners. To improve safety, the automaker added a full array of technologies, including a blind-spot monitor, automatic emergency braking, and available traffic sign recognition and driver attention assist.",CADILLAC,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""CT5"",  ""year"": ""2025"",  ""size"": ""midsize"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""technological""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""curved""],    ""grille"": [""lower"", ""wider""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""new stack-up signature""],    ""bumper"": [""new"", ""light-gray slim lip spoiler""],    ""wheel"": [""new design"", ""sporty""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""fastback shape""],    ""diffusor"": [""rear"", ""flanking the rear""],    ""spoiler"": [""rear deck"", ""light-gray slim lip""],    ""exhaust"": [""four rectangular"", ""peaked underneath the bumper""]  }}```"
CADILLAC XT4,"In late February 2023, Cadillac revealed the info regarding the refreshed 2024 XT4, which was the smallest SUV in the brand's inventory. After four years on the market, the XT4 received a much-needed update in more areas but obviously retained the same E2XX platform shared with the second generation of the Envision from Buick. Some of its styling updates were inspired by the all-electric Liryq. Also, the interior boasted some serious upgrades, which made customers feel like they were in a much larger vehicle. At the front, the vertical LED lines that flanked the front fascia were kept in place. But in addition, the headlights were moved next to them, with three headlamps stacked, one on top of the other. The XT4's mesh grille sported the brand's badge in an upper center position, like on the non-facelifted version. Also, as a final touch, the lower dam was redesigned to lower the drag coefficient and also boasted a lip spoiler at the bottom of the bumper. Cadillac completely changed the interior, and the 2024 XT4 boasted a curved 33"" glass panel in front of the driver where the instrument panel and the infotainment touchscreen were hosted. Moreover, on the center console, there was a new gear selector for the automatic transmission. The door cards were also new. Thus, the luxurious appearance of the vehicle was enhanced. Last but not least, a 13-speaker AKG sound system was available across the range. Under the hood, the engine lost a few ponies compared to its predecessor, but the torque remained the same.",CADILLAC,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""XT4"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""small SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""luxurious"", ""curved"", ""sporty"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""curved""],    ""grille"": [""mesh"", ""upper-center position""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""vertical LED lines"", ""three stacked headlamps""],    ""bumper"": [""lower dam redesigned"", ""lip spoiler""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""new door cards""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CADILLAC Escalade,"General Motors stepped up its game and introduced the Escalade IQ in 2023 as part of the electric-car revolution. Since it already had the advanced Ultium platform that was already used on the Chevrolet Silverado EV, the automaker thought that it would be a great idea to use it on the luxurious Escalade and added the IQ badge behind that famous nameplate. Since the Escalade was considered the luxury brand's flagship, it just came naturally for the American brand to burn the midnight oil and provide customers with an exquisite experience. Besides the technology and the luxury features of the vehicle, the Escalade IQ had to be bold-looking and provide a demanding look on the road. The SUV featured a front fascia adorned with LED headlights that surrounded the main V-shaped panel where the badge took center stage. On the sides, the vertically-mounted daytime running lights clearly defined the vehicle's edges. From its profile, the Escalade IQ has shown tall door panels that cover one-third of the car's height. Behind the rear doors, the raked-forward C-pillars and the wrap-around rear windscreen created a dynamic look for the full-size American SUV. Inside, Cadillac installed a luxurious cabin with up to six leather-wrapped seats. On the dashboard, the Escalade IQ boasted a wide curved display that covered the entire area between the A-pillars. Fronting the driver was the instrument panel, followed by the infotainment units' display atop the center stack. In addition, a separate touchscreen hosted the controls for the HVAC system. Furthermore, the side passenger had it own big display that controlled some of the audio. One of the IQ's advantages was the front storage compartment that was large enough to fit two sets of golf clubs. In addition, at the back, the trunk's maximum space could reach a staggering 119.2 cu-ft (3,375 liters). Cadillac adjusted the Ultium platform to provide a comfortable ride for its customers. As a result, the pneumatic, adaptive suspension and the battery pack could provide a smooth ride, and the driver could've lowered the ground clearance by 2 inches (50 mm) for easy access or raised it by 1 inch (25 mm) for crossing over obstacles. Despite the SUV's mass, the Escalade IQ offered up to 680 HP (500 kW) to please its customers. The battery pack fitted inside the vehicle's floor was large enough to hold up to 200 kWh of juice. Last but not least, Cadillac thought about the SUV's maneuverability. Besides the all-wheel drive system, the Escalade IQ also featured a system named Four-Wheel Steer that could lower the turning radius to 39.4 feet (12 meters), comparable to compact-sized vehicles. In addition, the same system could've been used to move the car diagonally, thus easing entering and exiting parking spots.",CADILLAC,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Escalade IQ"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""full-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""bold-looking"", ""demanding"", ""luxurious"", ""dynamic"", ""exquisite""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""tall"", ""wrap-around""],    ""grille"": [""V-shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""surrounding""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""large""],    ""doors"": [""tall"", ""luxurious""],    ""roof"": [""curved""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CADILLAC Escalade ESV,"The Escalade was available in two body lengths, and the top-of-the-line ESV was the most expensive and the most luxurious from its lineup. While other carmakers had their flagships as limousines, Cadillac's top vehicle was the Escalade. Even though it was built on the same platform as a workhorse pickup, its luxurious interior and exterior design made it a flagship like no other. With a front fascia that could be mistaken for a brick-wall, the 2021 Escalade was a commanding appearance on the road. Its broad grille sported the big Cadillac's shield badge. Its narrow LED headlights were positioned on a higher position, on the sides, flanking the grille. The carmaker installed the daytime running lights on the bumper's outer sides arranged as vertical strips in scoops. Unlike its smaller sibling, the regular Escalade, the ESV featured a longer bodywork and wheelbase. To conceal the added length, the designers installed an additional glass area between the rear doors and the last row of windows. Inside, the carmaker installed a curved OLED screen at the front, which included the instrument panel in a distinct area in front of the driver. For the rear-seat entertainment, Cadillac installed additional screens behind the front seat headrests. It was available with either a captain-seat second row or a bench, while the third row was wide enough to accommodate three people. While the regular Escalade offered adequate room for the last-row passengers, the carmaker offered plenty of trunk with all the seats up in the ESV version. With the second and third-row folded, it offered. Under the hood, Cadillac installed a choice of two engines: a 6.2-liter V-8 and a 3.0-liter turbodiesel inline-six. Both were paired to a ten-speed automatic transmission and available with rear- or all-wheel-drive.",CADILLAC,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Escalade"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""commanding"", ""long"", ""spacious"", ""powerful""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""curved""],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""big"", ""sporty""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""narrow"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""vertical"", ""scooped""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""wide""],    ""roof"": [""additional glass area""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CADILLAC XT5,"For the 2020 model year, Cadillac has decided to revamp the best-selling XT5 SUV, upgrading the model with a slightly revised exterior design, better technology, new interior trims and a brand new turbocharged engine. Notable improvements were made on the safety side, as the upgraded model was equipped with forward-collision warning, low-speed automatic emergency braking and lane keeping assist. Complementing the rather minor changes to the exterior design, which include a more aggressive engine grille, the facelifted Cadillac XT5 engine lineup now includes a 2.0-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder paired as standard with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Using a twin-scroll turbocharged, the engine is rated at 237 horsepower and 350 Nm (258 lb-ft) of torque. The top of the range 3.-6 liter V6 is still rated at 310 horsepower and 367 Nm (272 lb-ft) of torque. The Cadillac XT5 was offered in four trim levels: base XT5, Luxury, Premium Luxury and Platinum The base version includes numerous goodies such as automatic headlights, rear parking sensors, keyless go, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery, Apple Car Play, Android auto and many others. The Luxury trims level adds a heated steering wheel, a panoramic sunroof, heated front seats, wireless charging, a 14-speaker Bose surround system, blind spot monitoring and the safety features mentioned before. The Premium Luxury came with 20-inch alloys, adaptive suspension and ventilated front seats. The Platinum which was sold at around $66,000 included the Driver Assist Package and some unique items – exterior trim, unique interior colors, upgraded leather upholstery. It also included a head-up display and a surround view parking camera.",CADILLAC,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Cadillac XT5"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""Not specified"",  ""overall-design"": [""Slightly revised exterior design"", ""Aggressive engine grille""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""Aggressive""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""Automatic""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""20-inch alloys""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""Panoramic sunroof""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CADILLAC XTS,"The 2018 XTS Cadillac came with both lots of similarities and significant changes from the 2017 model. The exterior design was refreshed to make the XTS look even more elegant and more aggressive than before, with its unique LED daytime running lights continued on the front bumper. Front parking sensors were integrated in the front bumper and, safety wise, the XTS was equipped with lots of technology. At the back, the XTS had a dual exhaust with chrome tips, while the taillights had full LED lightning. The XTS came with 3 trim levels: the base called simply “XTS”, “Luxury”, “Premium”, “Platinum” and “V-Sport Platinum”. Inside the XTS’ cabin were softer materials than in the 2017 model and there was not a surface that wasn’t comfortable to touch. The leather upholstery quality was increased and the seats were modified to look and feel more modern. Lots of room was available in the cabin, the passengers in the back having large legroom and headroom. Cadillac didn’t disappoint this time either with the trunk space, having a capacity of 510 L. The XTS was available with two engine options, both a 3.6-liter V6, one naturally aspirated and one twin turbocharged, with 304 hp, respectively, 410 hp. The turbocharged engine came with AWD only.",CADILLAC,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""XTS Cadillac"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""elegant"", ""aggressive"", ""modern"", ""spacious"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""refreshed"", ""unique"", ""integrated""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""daytime running""],    ""bumper"": [""front"", ""parking sensors""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual"", ""chrome tips""],  }}```"
CADILLAC CT4,"Cadillac shuffled its nameplates again when it introduced the CT4 on the market in 2019 for the 2020 model year, replacing the former ATS as its premium entry-level sedan. Only this time, it looked like it focused more on the vehicle's dynamics than on the comfort side. Cadillac has been building luxury cars forever, and the CT4 had to live up to its predecessors, regardless of its new nameplate. But there were a few things that the American luxury carmaker knew how to do better to make its cars attractive in an era where electrification was trendy and big block engines were forgotten. Fortunately, the CT4 shared the same platform with the retired ATS, and that was one of the best platforms Cadillac made to that date. But, apart from that, it was a new vehicle, not a redesigned one. Right from the bat, the design team burned the midnight oil to create a strong image for the car. The massive chromed grille at the front flanked by headlights enhanced with full LED lights created a powerful look for the vehicle. In addition, the lower bumper sported a trapezoidal-shaped center grille flanked by vertical side scoops. From its profile, the CT4 boasted an elegant ascending beltline that the carmaker emphasized with a chromed door trim. The greenhouse followed the design language of the cab-rearward trend. At the back, the sloped-down rear windscreen and the short and tall deck created the image of a sporty vehicle because that's what Cadillac's marketing team considered would be attractive to customers. Inside, Cadillac created a cabin centered around the driver. The tall center console and the dashboard moved towards the driver's seat, offering them a race-car-inspired sensation. In addition, the automaker installed a classic instrument cluster filled with a mix of analog dials for the speedometer and tachometer and an LCD that showed data from the car's onboard computer. Furthermore, the technology pack included a touchscreen placed atop the center stack that allowed Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. In addition, it could also serve as a hot spot for other occupants of the vehicle. There was ample legroom at the front, and the bolstered seats provided adequate side support during high-speed cornering. In the back, the automaker installed a profiled-for-two bench seat for a reason. The transmission tunnel was quite high, thus preventing a third occupant from sitting comfortably there. Nevertheless, GM installed a third, center-mounted seatbelt. Those looking for a V8 or, at least, a V6 engine under the CT4's hood were disappointed since the automaker offered the vehicle with a choice of inline-four turbocharged units. Still, the performance was there, and fans of big engines had to admit that the car was quick on its toes. The most powerful version provided more than 300 ponies to the rear or all corners of the vehicle via a standard 10-speed automatic transmission. The lower grades got a 2.0-turbocharged unit paired with an eight-speed automatic.",CADILLAC,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""CT4"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""powerful"", ""elegant"", ""sporty"", ""driver-centered"", ""tech-savvy""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""full LED""],    ""bumper"": [""trapezoidal-shaped""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""chromed""],    ""roof"": [""ascending beltline""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CADILLAC CT6,"After almost ten years since the Cadillac Fleetwood was cut from the assembly line, the American premium carmaker introduced a proper successor for it: the CT6. While the Fleetwood was addressed mainly to the classic American businessmen, the CT6 looked like it aimed at Wall Street's young guns. To make the car even more attractive, GM decided to introduce a performance version, named CT6 V-Sport. And it wasn't just a badge on the trunk and some bigger wheels. It was a 550 hp beast that could tear up the tarmac and still look good in front of the Opera. There was a new design language for the American premium brand, and with its sharp lines and LED strips at the front. It made a good impression. Its large mesh-grille was utterly black, apart from the Cadillac badge installed on top-middle. On the sides, the long Caddy stood on 20"" V-Sport wheels shod with summer tires. An aerodynamic package emphasized the sporty look of the vehicle. Inside, there was still a luxurious vehicle despite its front bucket seats and the 2-seat profiled bench in the rear. Since it was introduced in 2018, it featured new technologies such as 4G-LTE connectivity for the infotainment system and a 10"" screen on the center stack. The biggest change for Cadillac was underneath the surface. Under the hood, GM installed a completely new 4.2-liter V8 engine, packed with technology. The direct fuel injection, no push-rod distribution, and, on top of that, a hot-V8 twin-turbo configuration. It featured a pair of twin-scroll turbochargers between the cylinder banks to lower the turbo-lag. The result was a 550 hp monster. It was paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Last but not least, Cadillac CT6 V Sport was all-wheel-drive with different settings according to the drive mode.",CADILLAC,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""CT6"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""sharp"", ""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""attractive"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""large"", ""mesh"", ""black""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""20-inch"", ""V-Sport""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""twin-turbo""]  }}```"
CADILLAC CT4-V,"Cadillac dropped two bombs in February 2021 with a pair of track-ready sedans determined to steal the Germans' performance premium crowns. The CT4-Blackwing was the supped-up Caddillac that all the younger generation still attracted to performance vehicles should try. The American premium carmaker threw its punches to the BMW 3-Series and the Mercedes-Benz C-Class when it introduced a high-performance sports sedan available with a Tremec 6-speed manual twin-discs. Thus, the officials said, the driver won't burn the clutch. Its magnetic ride control and the electronically controlled rear LSD were tuned for daily drives to the grocery store or track performance. There were a few differences from the outside on the CT4-Blackwing compared to the regular CT4. It looked sportier and meaner. Its dagger-like daytime running lights with LEDs were spread from top to bottom of the front fascia. Between them, a mesh-grille with carbon-fiber elements on the top enhanced the sporty look. From its sides, through the 18"" light-alloy-wheels, the massive 380 mm (14.96"") disc brakes confirmed the car's sporty designation. A carbon-fiber aerodynamic kit was offered as an option and completed the look with a wing spoiler and a diffuser in the back of the car. Inside, apart from the sport bucket seats, the carmaker added more carbon-fiber trims on the door panels and the center console. A TFT display replaced the analog dials but kept a traditional look for the tachometer, which was placed in the middle. From the technological point of view, the CT4-Blackwing featured a twin-turbo V6 engine that provided 472 hp and 640 Nm (472 lb-ft) of torque sent to the rear wheels via a standard 6-speed manual or a 10-speed automatic. Cadillac took an intriguing decision to fit titanium connecting rods for the engines paired to a manual gearbox.",CADILLAC,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""CT4-Blackwing"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""mean"", ""aggressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""mesh"", ""carbon-fiber""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""dagger-like"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""18-inch"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [""carbon-fiber trims""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""carbon-fiber""],    ""spoiler"": [""wing""],    ""exhaust"": [""twin""]  }}```"
CADILLAC CT5-V,"Cadillac took a luxury sedan and turned it into a hot-rod when it dropped the Corvette engine under its hood, but it did more than that. For a long time, the American luxury sedans were just comfortable. Apart from their fuel-injection system, they had the same technology as a WWII car. It was no wonder that the Germans were all over them on the streets and in the sales charts. Then, Cadillac said, ""that's it!"" and forgot its regular customers from the AARP and turned its attention towards the younger generations. Then, the GM management realized that a powerful Cadillac is a better Cadillac. So, the performance Caddies were born. They say not to judge a book by its cover, but the CT5-Blackwing says a lot about itself. Its headlights looked like it was from the Marvel world. Its broad mesh-grille was complemented by a lower one in the apron while the two vertical LED strips resembled two daggers from a silent killer. The design team added more spice in the back, including a carbon-fiber trunk-spoiler and, under the bumper, a multi-slat diffuser that hid four squared exhausts. Inside, the carmaker tried to offer a sportier look for its customers. In a way, it did it by installing carbon-fiber trims on the door panels and the center console, but not on the dashboard. The instrument cluster featured a TFT display where the tachometer took center stage. The CT5-Blackwing was the most potent street vehicle ever built by the American carmaker. Unlike its main rivals, its 6.2-liter supercharged engine was paired as standard to a 6-speed manual gearbox while a 10-speed automatic was on the options list.",CADILLAC,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""CT5-Blackwing"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxury"", ""sporty"", ""powerful"", ""aggressive"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""mesh""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""Marvel-inspired""],    ""bumper"": [""multi-slat"", ""diffuser""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""carbon-fiber trims""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""carbon-fiber"", ""multi-slat""],    ""spoiler"": [""carbon-fiber""],    ""exhaust"": [""four squared""]  }}```"

CADILLAC Lyriq,"Cadillac stormed the luxury car market in 2022 when it introduced the all-electric Liriq, which was unveiled a the 2021 Shanghai Auto Show, but then the pandemic struck. Even though the American Automaker had all the ingredients to produce the vehicle, it had to postpone it until 2022, when the deliveries started, due to the COVID-19 pandemic that stopped the world. And then the microchip issue also raised other delays. Yet Cadillac didn't back down and showed the world a vehicle on par with the best in the automotive industry. The American all-electric crossover sported a futuristic, dynamic design. Its front fascia featured a broad grille that was mostly a trim since the car didn't need that much cooling area. On the sides, the tall side scoops looked like two arrows pointing toward the vehicle's center and hosted the daytime running lights. The Lyriq's profile was even more intriguing with its sloped roofline that resembled a sport-utility-coupe shape and a raked-forward rear windscreen. Finally, at the back, the L-shaped higher taillights were accompanied by two additional vertical light strips. Of course, all of them were LEDs. Inside, Cadillac proved worthy of its heritage and mixed high-end luxury with high-end technology. There was not a single analog dial on the dashboard. Instead, it consisted of a TFT display in front of the driver and a touchscreen atop the center stack. Both were neatly concealed behind a curved glass panel, creating a panoramic view for the driver. The AKG sound system offered a unique architecture with 19 speakers spread around the cabin, including in the headrests. The Lyriq offered a spacious room for five adults, with a flat floor at the back so all three seats could have been easily used.",CADILLAC,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Lyriq"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""futuristic"", ""dynamic"", ""intriguing"", ""sporty"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped"", ""panoramic""],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""trim""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""daytime running""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""spacious""],    ""roof"": [""sloped"", ""coupe-like""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CATERHAM Supersport,"Caterham was already known in the world of lightweight and fast vehicles. It used the same recipe prescribed by the famous Colin Chapman back in the late 50s when it made the famous Lotus Seven but added some modern touches to the car. The result was a nimble two-seater with go-kart handling and supersport car 0 to 60 mph (0-97 kph) time. Last but not least, these were very affordable compared to their performance. When Colin Chapman founded Lotus Cars in the late 40s, his idea was ""Simplify, then add lightness."" As a result, he created special sports cars for those who didn't need or want any unnecessary items inside their vehicles when they were going around a track. One of his masterpieces was the Lotus Seven. It was considered the epitome of lightweight, designed for sports vehicles. It only had an engine, a gearbox, a chassis, and minimal bodywork to cover mechanical parts, but not the cockpit. In 1973, he sold the rights to produce that vehicle to Caterham Cars, and this company continued to make it and improve it over time. The Supersport kept the original concept intact. It featured a low and long engine compartment compared to the overall length of the vehicle. The exposed suspension elements for the front suspension and the minimalist front fenders that covered only the wheels added more character to the Caterham Seven. The doors, just like on the rest of the Caterham vehicles, were only needed if the occupants needed some protection against rain. Behind the cabin, another set of fenders covered the rear wheels, and then the car ended with an almost vertical, yet slightly tilted forward, panel. Inside the cockpit, the driver and their side passengers were divided by the transmission tunnel where the carmaker installed a short gear stick. In front of them was a flat panel that supported several dials that showed the engine's revs, oil and water temperature, oil pressure, and the speedometer. A thick, removable steering wheel fronted the driver. Caterham installed a pair of thin plastic high-bolstered bucket seats that were barely padded with a thin layer of fabric to provide not just some comfort but mostly friction so the occupants wouldn't slide out during high-speed cornering maneuvers. Under the hood, the car manufacturer installed a Ford 1.6-liter naturally aspirated engine tuned to produce 139 HP (142 PS). Even though this value was not impressive, it did its job very well thanks to the light weight of the vehicle. Thanks to the 520 kg (1146 lbs), the power-to-weight ratio was fantastic, allowing the car to sprint from naught to sixty in a mere 4.9 seconds with a top speed of 120 MPH (194 kph).",CATERHAM,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Caterham Seven"",  ""year"": ""1973"",  ""size"": ""nimble two-seater"",  ""overall-design"": [""lightweight"", ""nimble"", ""minimalist"", ""sporty"", ""affordable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""low"", ""long""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""exposed suspension elements"", ""minimalist front fenders""],    ""doors"": [""minimalist"", ""optional""],    ""roof"": [""almost vertical"", ""tilted forward""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""under the hood""],  }}```"
CATERHAM Seven 620,"The Lotus Seven built by the British company for twenty years between 1952 and 1972 didn't die. It just got better and faster in the shape of the Caterham, and the 2013 620R is a quick and solid proof. When Lotus built the original Seven, it thought that all a driver need is an engine, a chassis, a gearbox, and a seat. Due to regulations, it installed the headlights, a windshield, and a bodywork so the vehicle should look like a vehicle. Caterham bought the license for the famous British roadster and continued to build with different engines and newer technologies. The 620R for the Seven was introduced in 2013 and its look was a clear statement of performance. It was a true driver's car with minimal or no compromises. The shape was the same with a long hood when compared to the rest of the car, an air-intake on the hood and two exposed round headlights mounted on rods. The exposed double-wishbone front suspension and the big 7 on the grille were part of the design appeal. It is hard to say that the Seven had an interior design. It had two seats in a tiny cockpit and no windshield. It had some wind deflectors, just for a better look. The carbon-fiber panel from left to right in front of the driver was also the instrument panel. On the high center tunnel, the manufacturer installed the gear-stick for the sequential gearbox. The seats were tight and should have been custom made for the buyer. The engine was a two-liter supercharged unit that offered 310 hp on a car that weighed 545 kg (1201 lbs). That led to a staggering power-to-weight ratio of 568 hp/tonne.",CATERHAM,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Lotus Seven"",  ""year"": ""2013"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""performance"", ""minimalist"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""absent"", ""minimal""],    ""grille"": [""big 7""],    ""hood"": [""long"", ""air-intake""],    ""headlights"": [""exposed"", ""round""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CATERHAM CSR,"Caterham did another upgrade to its timeless machine and introduced the CSR in 2005, adding more spicy ingredients to the already flavored British roadster. The three letters from the car's name don't have anything to do with Corporate Social Responsibility. It would rather be Irresponsibility. The little roadster had a lot of connections with racing technology but lacked in the comfort department or daily usage. And yet, it was such an awesome machine that many racing drivers praised its qualities, which were rarely outshined by other similar stripped-down roadsters. The UK provided some of the most outstanding vehicles in automotive history. Cars such as Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Lotus, and Land Rover are just a few examples. The Lotus 7, for instance, was built as a race car with only an engine at the front and a few body panels to protect the driver's shoes from getting wet. Caterham bought the license to build the Lotus Seven in 1973 from Colin Chaman himself and kept upgrading the original vehicle. The aluminum body panels and the rigid chassis were the main elements of the vehicle. The 2005 CSR version was a reminder of a batch of 20 vehicles built by Caterham in 1974 based on the Lotus Seven Series 4. For the tight cockpit, Caterham offered a redesigned dash panel fitted with white dials and red needles. The center console hosted the gear stick for the six-speed manual transmission. At the same time, the driver was spoiled with a Momo racing steering wheel and a set of aluminum pedals. Just like its 1974 predecessor, the 2005 Caterham CSR was fitted with a Cosworth engine, only this time it was turbocharged. Moreover, it sent the power to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual, while the independent suspension in all corners was vastly improved.",CATERHAM,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Caterham CSR"",  ""year"": ""2005"",  ""size"": ""small roadster"",  ""overall-design"": [""timeless"", ""flavored"", ""spicy"", ""stripped-down"", ""awesome""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""aluminum""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""racing""],    ""doors"": [""tight"", ""redesigned""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""turbocharged""]  }}```"
CATERHAM Classic,"Caterham was the only car manufacturer that bought the rights to build the Lotus Seven and improved it over the years. It was an ultimate roadster/toy/track-day weapon. Collin Chapman designed the Lotus Seven in the '50s, and it was the quintessence of a road-legal race-car. Many cars pretended to be race-cars with number plates, but none of them could be what the Seven was. The British engineer had one goal: to mount an engine into a car that was as light as possible. Graham Nearm, a former Lotus dealer, bought Lotus's rights and built the Seven after the carmaker dropped the roadster from its lineup. The construction was simple: a set of aluminum panels attached to a tubular steel chassis. The exposed suspension struts and the separate fenders were typical for Caterham vehicles, while its round headlights were attached to the bodywork via chromed mounts. Like the original model, the little roadster featured a straight windshield and a small cabin big enough to fit two occupants separated by the tall center tunnel. Behind them, there was only the rear axle and a vertical panel. It is hard to say about the Caterham that it had an interior. It was just a place with two seats, a dash panel, and a steering wheel. A few buttons and switches were installed for lights, wipers, and a hazard button. The bucket-seats were designed to hold their occupants in place while hard cornering since the Caterham was known for its high-speed cornering abilities. Under the hood, there was an inline-four engine that sent its power to the rear wheels. Despite its low power, it could rocket the car to 100 kph (62 mph) in under seven seconds.",CATERHAM,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Caterham Seven"",  ""year"": ""1950s"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""lightweight"", ""race-car inspired"", ""minimalist""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""straight""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""simple""],    ""headlights"": [""round"", ""chromed mounts""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CATERHAM Roadsport,"The Caterham bought the license for the nimble roadster Lotus 7 and started to make it with new engines and technologies. It started to do that in 1973 and in 2007 it introduced the Roadsport. Caterham noticed that their customers cannot drive their cars on the road and the reason for that kind of car was to be on the roads, not in garages or exclusively on the track. So, it added the Roadsport version. A model that could handle better both the roads and the tracks. With its long nose and the seats moved far back above the rear axle, the Caterham was a fine example of retro-classic design. The shape didn't change too much over the years. Just the materials used the engines and the seats. Since it started with Ford-sourced engines in 1973, it still had the same engine supplier, but with better units. Inside the cockpit, there were two seats side-by-side for the occupants. There was no trunk or a room for luggage. Just two Recaro seats, a flat instrument panel, and a steering wheel. No doors and no doors either. Under the long hood, there was a Ford Sigma engine with 1.6-liter displacement. It was offered with 125 or 140 hp respectively, the latter being used more for track days than for cruising. It was mated to a standard 6-speed gearbox.",CATERHAM,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Caterham Roadsport"",  ""year"": ""2007"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""nimble"", ""retro-classic"", ""road-friendly"", ""track-ready""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""long""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""long""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""none""],    ""roof"": [""none""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""standard""]  }}```"
CATERHAM Superlight,"Caterham has always made vehicles for the track more than for the pleasure of driving on public roads. The Supersport takes it to another level, though. And the Superlight R400 was, basically, a kit-car provided in a crate for someone to assembly it. It didn't last long until the British company started to assemble them and sell them as complete vehicles. The Superlight vehicle was provided as a short wheelbase (SR) or long wheelbase (SV) chassis base, providing more room for the passengers and their luggage. That if someone would be crazy enough to travel long distances in a car that has harsh suspension, crisp acceleration and having absolutely no soundproofing. The Superlight name came from the extensive use of carbon fiber on the dashboard and front wings, GRP aeroscreen and seats racing harness and a removable steering wheel. Of course, no airbag was installed. All Superlight models come with a 2.0 liters Ford Duratec engine with different power outputs. The R400 has 210 hp and the R500 has 263 hp. A sequential six-speed gearbox was available as an option. The R500 with that gearbox was timed on a 0 to 60 mph (0-96 kph) sprint in 2.88 seconds. The maximum speed was 150 mph (240 kph). A detuned version, called the R300, used the 177 hp version, which was called Supersport R. In October 2012 a supercharged model called “R600” for a race-series above the R300-class was released, including slick tires and a sequential gearbox as standard.",CATERHAM,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Caterham Superlight"",  ""year"": ""2012"",  ""size"": ""short wheelbase (SR) or long wheelbase (SV)"",  ""overall-design"": [""track-focused"", ""kit-car"", ""lightweight"", ""carbon fiber-intensive"", ""racing-inspired""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""sequential six-speed gearbox"", ""slick tires""]  }}```"
CATERHAM Seven 160,"The Caterham 2013 base model was the 160 model, which didn't feature a four-cylinder engine, but a turbocharged motorcycle three-cylinder unit. If someone would like to have a car built for trackdays, it could look no further than the Caterham Seven 160. It was precisely what Collin Chapman ever wanted with the Lotus Seven: a light, nimble roadster that could use the low weight to compensate for the low power. For starters, Caterham sold the base model with bodywork and steel-wheels. The windscreen, the doors, and the canvas-top were on the options list. It sold the car either in a kit to be assembled by the new owner or delivered as a complete vehicle and charged more for it. The cabin was hardly named ""interior"" since it was completely open in the base version. But while there was no problem to buy and install the side panels and the roof after the customer bought the car, the heater had to be ordered before. Yes, that was on the options list. Forget about any kind of luxury in that Caterham. It was as comfortable as a wooden bench in the park. Just add some pouring rain, and you'll get the real picture. Under the long hood was a Suzuki turbocharged engine that provided 80 hp, which was translated into a 160 hp/tone since the empty vehicle weight was 500 kilos (1080 lbs). An open rear differential was fitted as standard, and that prevent the car from drifting too much.",CATERHAM,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Caterham Seven 160"",  ""year"": ""2013"",  ""size"": ""small, light"",  ""overall-design"": [""nimble"", ""open"", ""minimalist"", ""track-focused""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""optional""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""long""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""steel""],    ""doors"": [""optional""],    ""roof"": [""optional""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""turbocharged""]  }}```"
CATERHAM The Super Seven 1600,"No ABS, no traction control, no radio, no infotainment system, just some extended fenders and an exposed exhaust. Sounds like a 70s’ car? Sure does. Only that it’s not. The Caterham Seven was first launched in 1973, based on the Lotus Seven from 1957. The 2020 Super Seven 1600 was revealed in 2020. While the base remained pretty much the same, it had an improved suspension, a stronger chassis and, of course, a modern engine. The engine was actually 1.6-liter 4-cylinder with 135 hp and 160 Nm torque. 135 hp might not sound like enough for 2020, however, if you take into consideration the car’s weight, you would understand why this car was agile and had a top speed of 200 kph. With its total weight of 565 kg, the new classic could get to 100 kph in 5 seconds. The power was sent to the wheels through a 5-speed manual transmission, offering the driver a pure driving experience. Did I mention the small car was not equipped with power steering? That pretty much added to unfiltered sensation. The driver would very much feel in control of the vehicle and one of the reasons would be the seat being located on the rear axle, while the driver’s hands would be connected directly to the front wheels. Its release price for the standard version would be around $44.000. Would you pay that amount for such a car? Or up to $60.000 for the top of the range?",CATERHAM,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Caterham Seven"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""classic"", ""agile"", ""lightweight"", ""minimalist"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""small""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""extended""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""exposed""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""exposed""]  }}```"
CHEVROLET TrailBlazer,"While in the U.S., the TrailBlazer was no longer offered, in other countries, that vehicle was still sold, although as a crossover and with a slightly different spelling as the Trailblazer. In 2012, Chevrolet introduced the Trailblazer for various countries based on the same chassis as the Colorado pickup. Almost eight years later, the bow-tie brand shrunk the vehicle again and used the Buick Encore's platform to produce it. But, in 2023, the crossover got a facelift that kept it fresh on the market and with updated technologies inside. The 2024 model-year kept the same idea of headlights mounted lower in the bumper and with its DRLs placed above them at the hood's edge. But, unlike its predecessor, it featured a different grille with a honeycomb mesh, and the badge was placed on the chromed horizontal slat, not above it as on the 2020 version. Still, Trailblazer's profile kept the same sculptured doors, and rugged-looking wheel arches adorned with black molds. For the upper trim levels, the 2024 Trailblazer was available with 19"" light-alloy wheels. Inside, the automaker worked its magic and deleted all the analogical dials and gauges from the instrument panel and replaced them with an 8"" display fronting the driver. In addition, the redesigned dashboard sported an 11"" touchscreen display mounted atop the center stack. But the rest of the cabin remained largely unchanged, with two bucket seats at the front and a split-folding bench in the back suitable for three occupants.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Trailblazer"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""compact crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""compact"", ""stylish""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""angled""],    ""grille"": [""honeycomb"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [""edged""],    ""headlights"": [""lower-mounted"", ""DRLs above""],    ""bumper"": [""modern""],    ""wheel"": [""rugged-looking"", ""19-inch light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [""-""],    ""diffusor"": [""-""],    ""spoiler"": [""-""],    ""exhaust"": [""-""]  }}```"
CHEVROLET Silverado,"Chevrolet introduced the 2024 Silverado EV in 2022 and showed the future of its pickup lineup with this electron-powered vehicle aimed at customers who used it mostly for leisure and less for work. Built on top of the same ULTIUM platform as its sibling GMC Sierra EV and GMC HUMMER, the Silverado EV showed the future of this utility vehicle. Moreover, it wasn't just a leisure truck since Chevrolet offered it in several grades, including as a Work Truck beside the RST First Edition trim level. The vehicle's design was miles away from any other Silverado ever built. At the front, it featured narrow daytime running lights and an LED stripe that crossed the upper section of the main front fascia. Chevrolet installed the headlights lower, on the sides, in individual clusters. Where the regular grille used to be, the Silverado sported a body-colored panel adorned by the bow-tie badge on its top. From its profile, the plastic cladding on the wheel arches emphasized the car's rugged appearance. At the back, the bed was available with a Multi-Flex Midgate that expanded the loading length. Inside, GM provided a premium-vehicle interior fitted with all the latest technologies it had in stock. At the front, the automaker installed a pair of screens for the infotainment system and another for the instrument panel. At the back, the split-folding bench provided enough room for three passengers. But the most important part of the Silverado EV was under its skin. The ULTIUM platform provided a four-wheel drive and a four-wheel steering system. Thanks to its 664 hp (673 PS) and 780 lb-ft (1057 Nm), it could tow up to 10,000 lbs (4,536 kg) while having a payload of 1,300 lbs (590 kg). To top it all off, the Silverado EV could sprint from naught to 60 mph (0-97 kph) in less than 4.5 seconds.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Silverado EV"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""full-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""futuristic"", ""premium""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""narrow"", ""body-colored""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""lower-mounted"", ""individual clusters""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""plastic cladding""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CHEVROLET Blazer,"Chevrolet introduced a facelifted version for the Blazer SUV in 2022, and it improved the SUV in many areas, updating this beloved vehicle. While there is no comparison between the 2022 Blazer and the original K5 Blazer in terms of off-road performance, there was more to say about comfort and safety. Where the modern-era Blazer shined, the former trail-warrior lacked. General Motors installed upgraded safety systems such as Automatic Emergency Braking, Following Distance Indicator, Forward Collision Alert, Front Pedestrian Braking, Lane Keep Assist with Lane Departure Warning, and IntelliBeam automatic high beams. All these were included in the Safety Package offered on the 2022 Blazer. From the outside, the SUV received new LED headlights, daytime running lights, and taillights. It also boasted a new front fascia, with stylized mesh-grille expanded on the lower bumper area, to the apron. It was flanked by a pair of scoops where the carmaker placed the fog lights. Another upgrade for the Blazer was for the light-alloy wheels, which were enhanced with new designs and sizes up to 21"". Inside, Chevrolet's infotainment system gained a standard 10"" touchscreen placed atop the center stack. It complemented the TFT display installed inside the instrument cluster. Thus, the carmaker enriched the onboard features, enhancing the driving experience. Under the hood, GM placed the same powertrains as before. The base version had a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four, while the range-topping model was the direct fuel injected 3.6-liter V6.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Blazer"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""modern"", ""stylish"", ""enhanced"", ""upgraded"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""mesh"", ""stylized""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""daytime running""],    ""bumper"": [""lower"", ""stylish""],    ""wheel"": [""light-alloy"", ""enhanced"", ""21-inch""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CHEVROLET Bolt,"Five years after the successful introduction of the first Bolt EV, Chevrolet introduced an updated version that looked like a completely new generation. Chevrolet sold over 100.000 units from the Bolt EV in just five years before introducing the 2021 version. Even if it wasn't a new generation, it showed some differences that made it more appealing. Best of all, it was a lower price dropped about 15% when compared to its predecessor. Thus, it beat Tesla again in offering the most affordable electric car on the market. The 2021 Bolt EV shape was the same. It looked like a mix between a hatchback and a minivan. Maybe it wasn't the best aesthetic solution, but it worked well for the bow-tie brand. The new model featured LED daytime running lights and headlamps, while its predecessor was available only with regular bulbs. Its new front fascia featured a blacked-out grille with the Chevy badge in the middle. Inside, the 2021 Bolt EV featured a simple dashboard design with a 10.2"" infotainment display placed in the middle. An 8"" TFT screen filled the instrument cluster and made the analog dials obsolete. As an option, Chevrolet installed a safety system that measured the driver's fatigue and warned him to pull over and take a nap. It is understandable since the car rolled in silence for all the five passengers that could sit inside. In the back, the 60/40 split-folding bench was good to expand the trunk. Under the hood, Chevrolet counted on the same electrical system as its predecessor. A 200 hp electric motor fed by a 65 kWh battery pack ensured a range of up to 259 miles (416 km) on a full charge.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Bolt EV"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""hatchback, minivan"",  ""overall-design"": [""updated"", ""lower price"", ""LED lights"", ""simple dashboard"", ""silent""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""blacked-out""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CHEVROLET Equinox,"Chevrolet didn't rush on creating new electric vehicles, even though it was a pioneer in this domain with the EV1 in 1996. But this time, it didn't run and developed an entirely new platform named Ultium. General Motors likes to take things slowly and develop its products with patience. The EV-1 was not its only tryout in the electric-car segment. Its electrified Volt (Opel/Vauxhall Ampera in Europe) and the all-electric Bolt were just part of its development towards total electric transformation. At the beginning of 2022, the bow-tie brand unveiled the Equinox EV based on the same Ultium platform used by the Silverado EV pickup. Like its sibling, it was announced with an e-4WD traction system, with a dual-motor setup, one for each axle. The overall exterior design was still linked to the traditional look of an SUV, with a front area that reminded of the engine compartment. This time, though, its front fascia was not dominated by a massive grille with some specific cutouts for the cooling system. Since it was an all-electric vehicle, it didn't need that much. Instead, only a minor part served that purpose on the lower part of the bumper, while a pair of air-scoops channeled the air towards the car's sides to lower the drag resistance. Thanks to its short overhangs and long wheelbase, the Equinox provided a spacious interior. The cabin featured the same five-seat layout as usual in such a crossover, with a tall center console, which served as a storage area and armrest for the front occupants. At the back, the split-folding bench offered enough room for three passengers. Since there was no transmission tunnel, the floor was completely flat.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Equinox EV"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""spacious interior"",  ""overall-design"": [""traditional SUV look""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""minor part for cooling""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""lower air-scoops""],    ""wheel"": [""long wheelbase""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"

The exterior was updated with a refreshed front grille, updated front and rear fascias, LED headlamps and taillamps and 4 new wheels design. Apple Car Play and Android Auto and a new 8-inch diagonal driver information center were offered, as well as a wireless charging pad.

CHEVROLET Suburban,"The Chevrolet Suburban was first produced in 1934 and is the longest-running continuous nameplate in production establishing. At the end of 2019, a new chapter in the Suburban story began with the introduction of the 12th generation. The 2020 Suburban has a longer wheelbase than the previous model and new chassis systems that create greater ride smoothness, particularly on uneven pavement and unpaved surfaces. The new Suburban has the most passenger and cargo space of any SUV in its segment. The new multilink independent rear suspension, new technologies like Rear Pedestrian Alert and HD Surround Vision, new rear-seat media system and the new interior were specifically designed to take advantage of the class-leading space, with a mission to create the ultimate road trip environment. It is worth mentioning that the vehicles' load floors are significantly lower, providing a more natural seating position and a remarkable gain of 10 inches (254 mm) of third-row legroom, with big increases in cargo space. As for engines, the optional Duramax 3.0L inline-six turbo-diesel is available on all models except Z71 and develops 277 hp of power with a strong 460 lb-ft of torque, providing some of the highest fuel economy ratings in this segment.

CHEVROLET Tahoe,"Chevrolet Tahoe was first launched in 1995 and was initially called S10-Blazer, then simply Blazer and afterward rebadged as Tahoe. Now it is the best selling full-size SUV in the U.S. occupying over 25 percent of the segment, and for good reason: it is spacious, comfortable and ideal for long journeys. The new Tahoe is powered by 3 engines. The diesel engine is 3.0-liter and has 277 hp, while the gasoline versions are 5.3-liter with 355 hp, and 6.2-liter engine with a massive 420 hp (the fuel system of gasoline versions is Turbocharged Direct Injection). Technically, the Tahoe is almost identical to Suburban, except that Tahoe is bigger and offers more storage space. The car comes with today's required connectivity technology, Wi-Fi hotspot, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, USB charging ports, and wireless charging. Furthermore, it comes with new technologies like new HD Surround Vision and Rear Pedestrian Alert. Cadillac Tahoe uses the rear independent air suspension, lowering the car 4 inches, to allow it to react safely and smoothly to difficult terrain.

CHEVROLET Corvette Coupe,"The eighth generation of the Corvette broke covers in 2020, and it was the most significant upgrade in the model’s history since, unlike its predecessors, it didn’t have the engine mounted at the front but behind the cabin. And then, in January 2023, the American automaker shook its customers once more with the introduction of the E-Ray on the market. In January 2023, seven decades after the launch of the original Corvette at New York’s Motorama in 1953, GM unveiled the most technologically advanced version of this nameplate: the E-Ray. Its name suggested a connection with the Stingray, and unlike the rest of the C8 Corvette range, it was an electrified version. Still, GM didn’t adopt this solution just for environmental concerns but to improve the car’s performance. The increased fuel efficiency compared to its stablemates was just a bonus. In addition, the E-Ray was also the first all-wheel-drive Corvette in the model’s history. The E-Ray shared its bodywork with the Corvette Z06, meaning that it looked more aggressive than the Stingray. At the front, the lower splitter underneath the bumper featured two wide scoops on the sides that flanked a center grille. The short hood was continued by the raked windshield and the roof. From the sides, the wide air intakes fed the engine placed behind the cabin. Unlike its roadster sibling, the E-Ray coupe featured a sloped-down rear window that extended over the engine. Finally, at the back, the automaker installed a small lip spoiler on the deck. For the rear fascia, Chevrolet placed four rectangular-shaped taillights with red underlines, while below the bumper was a quad-exhaust. With its modern cockpit made for two, the American supercar created a luxurious and sporty environment for its customers. The two high-bolstered seats were separated by a tall center console, while in front of the driver was a digital instrument cluster. In addition, atop the center stack, GM added a touchscreen for the infotainment system, which the driver could control via a turning knob and a few buttons placed next to the gear selector’s buttons. On the passenger side of the center console, the automaker installed a handle-like bar with buttons for the HAVC system and the controls for the heated seats. But E-Ray’s most significant upgrade compared to its stablemates was found under its skin. Regardless of whether it was in the coupe or roadster shape, the car featured an electrified drivetrain. GM installed the 6.2-liter LT2 V8 engine that powered the rear wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission. At the same time, the front wheels were moved by a 160 hp (162 PS) motor. The total output power obtained reached 655 hp (664 PS). But the E-Ray could do something more than just help the car get a 2.5-second 0 to 60 mph (0-97 kph) sprint. It could also cruise in “Stealth Mode” via the electric motor only at speeds of up to 45 mph (72 kph). Still, the battery pack was just 1.9 kWh.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Corvette E-Ray"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""modern"", ""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""electrified""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [""center""],    ""hood"": [""short""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""lower splitter"", ""wide scoops""],    ""wheel"": [""wide air intakes""],    ""doors"": [""coupe"", ""roadster""],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""small lip""],    ""exhaust"": [""quad""]  }}```"
CHEVROLET Trax,"Chevrolet introduced the Trax nameplate in 2013 as a badge-engineered Opel/Vauxhall Mokka based on the same platform as a European small-segment vehicle, the Opel/Vauxhall Corsa. Fast forward nine years, and the bow-tie brand unveiled an entirely new Trax developed for the North American market. Surprisingly, it was bigger and less expensive than the model it replaced. In addition, it was better designed. Last but not least, it was ready for electrification. Introduced as a 2024 model year, the second generation of the Trax was 11 inches (28 cm) longer, two inches (5 cm) wider, and four inches (10 cm) lower than the model it replaced. The overall design resembled its bigger brother, the Blazer. It featured the same slim line of LED daytime running lights mounted high above the bumper. At the same time, the headlights were positioned lower on the vertical side slats. The massive grille took center stage and was crossed by a bar supporting the Chevrolet badge. Inside, the Trax came fitted with a standard 8” infotainment screen placed atop the center stack, with an option for an 11” unit. For the latter option, the automaker offered an 8” instrument cluster to go with it. There were five trim levels, and the upper ones featured man-made leather upholstery, a power driver seat, heated seats, and a sunroof. The Trax came with an inline-three turbocharged engine that lost some power compared with its predecessor. Moreover, it was paired with a six-speed automatic instead of a nine-speed or a CVT offered for the first-generation Trax. Despite that, the 2024 Trax was quicker on the 0 to 60 mph (0-97 kph) run than the model it replaced.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Trax"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""bigger, wider, lower"",  ""overall-design"": [""better designed"", ""resembled Blazer"", ""ready for electrification""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""slim line of LED daytime running lights""],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""crossed by a bar""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""positioned lower on the vertical side slats""],    ""bumper"": [""high-mounted LED daytime running lights""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""five trim levels"", ""man-made leather upholstery""],    ""roof"": [""option for a sunroof""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""inline-three turbocharged engine""]  }}```"
CHEVROLET Camaro,"It’s no new that the Camaro was well appreciated over the years. For 2019, Chevrolet redesigned the Camaro and added even more technology and options to suit every customer’s needs. The major changes for 2019 were the redesigned front and rear ends, the new LED headlamps available for every model and a new hood. A new version was introduced, with a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine that developed 275 hp and 400 Nm. This engine was mostly suitable for customer buying the Camaro for the muscular, beautiful exterior design more than for the power that came with it. The 2018 Camaro was available as a four-seat coupe or a convertible and offered no less than 6 trim levels: 1LS, 1LT, 2LT, 1SS, 2SS and ZL1. The first two had a standard 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, but could optionally be equipped with a more powerful 3.6-liter V6 engine that developed 335 hp. The base 1LS trim levels included standard features such as 18-inch alloys, LED running lights, a rear-view camera, keyless ignition, power-adjustable front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheels and adjustable driving modes. Technology wise, the Camaro was equipped with Bluetooth, OnStar emergency system, a 4G LTE Wi-Fi Connectivity and a 7-inch touchscreen with Android Auto and AppleCar play included.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Camaro"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""muscular, beautiful"",  ""overall-design"": [""redesigned"", ""technological"", ""muscular"", ""beautiful""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""redesigned""],    ""hood"": [""new""],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CHEVROLET Cruze,"Chevrolet introduced the second generation of the Cruze on the U.S. market in 2016, and, in 2018, it brought a refreshed version for it in both shapes: sedan and hatchback. Chevrolet decided to cut the development costs for the Cruze and took almost the entire Opel/Vauxhall Astra K plans in the U.S. Even though it took the bow-tie brand another year to adapt the product for the American market, the result was well worth it. More than half of the Cruze's customers were new to the Chevy brand, and the sedan version had its fans. Moreover, the slow sales of the manual gearbox convinced GM to ditch them from the list and offered the Cruze only with automatic transmissions, fitted as standard, on the 2019 model-year. Along with the facelift, the Cruze received a new front fascia that sported a broad lower grill in the lower bumper. It was flanked by a pair of side-scoops, which hosted the foglights. On top of that, the new headlights featured new DRLs. The profile revealed new wheel options for the Cruze, while at the back, the carmaker introduced new LED taillights. Inside, the carmaker added a standard 7"" touch-screen display for the infotainment unit. A SiriusXM Satellite radio was on the options list. Also, depending on the trim level, the carmaker added keyless entry and push-button start. The base LT level was also enhanced with new amenities. Under the hood, the carmaker offered just two options: a 1.4-liter turbocharged gasoline engine and a 1.6-liter turbo-diesel. The former was paired to either a six-speed automatic, while the oil burner got paired to a nine-speed automatic.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Cruze"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""sporty"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""lower""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""new"", ""DRLs""],    ""bumper"": [""lower""],    ""wheel"": [""new options""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CHEVROLET Malibu,"The ninth generation of the Chevrolet Malibu was introduced in 2015 at the New York Motor Show and it was updated in 2018 for the 2019 model year. Chevrolet did badge engineering since forever. In Europe, Opel and Vauxhall are one example. It was the same situation with other cars that crossed the Atlantic and received different names. One good example was the 2015 Malibu, which was an Opel Insignia with some aesthetical and technical improvements. The facelifted version featured a new front fascia. The Chevrolet bow-tie was installed on a new chrome bar. A bigger lower grille was installed on the 2019 Malibu. A new signature LED lights for the DRL was installed in the front apron. The headlights were available with LED technology as well. The back of the car was slightly changed, but not significant for the LS trim level, but different for the LT, which featured LED taillamps. There was a new set of 18” light-alloy wheels fitted on the new RS trim level, which offered a sportier look. Inside, the new 8” touch-screen was fitted as standard for the entire range. Another comfort feature that was changed was the access in the cabin. The 2019 Malibu, in LS trim, didn't feature unlock buttons on the exterior door handles. The biggest changes came under the hood. The base engine, a 1.5-liter turbocharged unit, was mated to a CVT instead of a 6-speed auto as the non-facelifted version. The Premier trim level received a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, paired to a 9-speed auto.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Chevrolet Malibu"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""facelifted"", ""sportier"", ""comfortable"", ""aesthetical"", ""technical""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""new"", ""chrome"", ""bigger""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""signature""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""18-inch"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [""access changed""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CHEVROLET Camaro Convertible,"No doubt, the Camaro is an icon of the American automotive industry. Its name is connected to the pony-car wars and The Transformers franchise. But the need for a bigger market made GM to chop the Camaro roof of and make it a convertible. And, in 2019, this open-top went through a major facelift in order to be more appealing to the younger generation. That is why they gave it new LED-dual headlights and a reshaped hood. Inside, there are enough features to stand-up to the new age of technology, with an infotainment unit that supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. And, due to its big wheelbase, it is a real four-seater, just with two doors. The 2019 modifications brought the 10-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters from the ZL1 version to the SS. Also, the 2.0-liter turbo engine was installed on a tailored chassis, derived from the V6 engine variants, which included a limited-slip differential and a six-speed manual transmission fitted as standard. The 275 hp and the 400 (295 lb-ft) of torque helped the convertible to move better in traffic, more fuel-efficient but still fast. The 5.2 seconds needed for the 0 to 60 mph sprint (0-96 kph) place the convertible Camaro L1E in the hot hatch territory, but with rear-wheel-drive and a soft-top, which should make it better than a hot hatch.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Camaro"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""big wheelbase"",  ""overall-design"": [""iconic"", ""youthful"", ""sporty"", ""modern"", ""convertible""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""reshaped""],    ""headlights"": [""LED-dual""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""big""],    ""doors"": [""two""],    ""roof"": [""soft-top""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CHEVROLET Matiz / Spark,"If there would be a contest for the best pizza-delivery car, the Spark could take the crown thanks to its low purchase price combined with great fuel efficiency. GM kept the old platform from Daewoo and used it over and over again for the Spark. Chevrolet introduced the fourth generation of the small vehicle in 2015 and, three years later, it received a mid-cycle refresh that brought new interior features and improved exterior styling. GM design department didn't have to go too far in improving the Spark. The grille was changed with a more prominent ""mouth"" in the lower bumper area and featured a chromed surrounding for both. An LED daytime running light system was enclosed in the headlights. In the rear, the taillights remained virtually unchanged. Inside, Chevrolet introduced a standard infotainment system that supported Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, plus access to MyChevrolet mobile app. Its 7"" touch-screen sat on top of the center stack. GM granted the U.S. customers a limited trial for the OnStar system. The dashboard didn't look like a budget-car one. Its instrument cluster featured a center-mounted speedometer with a tachometer on the left and an LCD on the right. At the far left, a small digital line showed the fuel level. If the steering wheel buttons were something special in the '90s, the 2018 Spark had them fitted as standard. In the U.S. It is offered with a 1.4-liter gasoline engine, with a claimed fuel consumption of 3.9 l/100 km (40 mpg.).

CHEVROLET Cruze - 5 doors,"Chevrolet introduced a significant facelift for the Cruze lineup in 2018 for the 2019 model-year. Besides the new visual changes, the carmaker introduced new transmissions and revised trim levels. Chevrolet found an intelligent way to cut the development costs of the Cruze and took the European Opel/Vauxhall Astra K, adapted it to the North-American market, and sold it as the Cruze. It was something it had tried before with the Saturn Astra, but the timing was so bad that the brand had to be deleted from GM's inventory. With the introduction of the refreshed lineup, the Cruze received a front fascia that followed the same design language as the Camaro. The swept-back headlights incorporated sharp lines for the daytime running lights fitted inside the headlamps. A wide grille with horizontal slats adorned the lower bumper, and it was flanked by extended, taller side scoops that hosted the foglights. The hatchback featured a new roof spoiler mounted at the top of the tailgate. At the same time, the rear bumper was redesigned and sported a new black trim that decorated the lower and the sides of the rear valance. In 2019, Chevrolet introduced the Cruze Hatch LS. The car's interior received a new 7"" touch-screen for the infotainment system. For the LT trim level, Chevrolet offered cruise control, aluminum wheels, and a six-speaker Sirius XM Satellite radio. Moreover, the Cruze was available with a keyless entry and push-button start option. Under the hood, the carmaker offered just two options: a 1.4-liter turbocharged gasoline engine and a 1.6-liter turbo-diesel. The former was paired to either a six-speed automatic, while the oil burner got paired to a nine-speed automatic.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Cruze"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""swept-back"", ""sharp lines"", ""wide grille"", ""horizontal slats"", ""taller side scoops"", ""roof spoiler"", ""revised rear bumper"", ""black trim""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wide"", ""horizontal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back"", ""sharp"", ""incorporated daytime running lights""],    ""bumper"": [""lower"", ""revised"", ""flanked by extended side scoops""],    ""wheel"": [""aluminum""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""new spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof-mounted""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CHEVROLET Sonic Sedan,"The Chevrolet Sonic released in 2015 was designed to replace the Aveo. It was available as a sedan or a hathback, both models having quite a nice look. The Sonic was inspired by motorcycle styling, fact to be noticed at the headlights’ design, as well as the center console inside the cabin. Even though the Sonic was a budget car, it drove well, the fuel consumption was reduced and even came with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The cabin was well isolated, offering a pleasant long trip. The Chevrolet Sonic was give a 5-star rating by the National Highway Safety Administration – a top safety pick award. It was equipped with blind spot mirrors and an optional crash avoidance system. Ten airbags were part of the standard equipment. As available optionals, the user could choose keyless entry, a 7-inch color touchscreen for the infotainment system, voice recognition, 4G LTE Wi-Fi (Wi-Fi Hotspot) and bluetooth. The car’s price started at $14.000 and we think the Sonic was more of a bargain sporty sedan. It was equipped with a base 1.8-liter engine developing 138 hp or a more efficient engine choice, a 1.4-liter naturally aspirated turbocharged engine. An sportier version of the Sonic was also brought to the public under the nameplate of Sonic RS – hatchback version only – a vehicle that featured a lowered suspension, redesigned exhaust, a nice flat-bottomed steering wheel and sport seats as well.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Chevrolet Sonic"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""budget"", ""sporty"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""safe""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sleek""],    ""grille"": [""modern""],    ""hood"": [""sporty""],    ""headlights"": [""motorcycle-inspired""],    ""bumper"": [""stylish""],    ""wheel"": [""sporty""],    ""doors"": [""conventional""],    ""roof"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""diffusor"": [""redesigned""],    ""spoiler"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""exhaust"": [""redesigned""]  }}```"
CHEVROLET Corvette Convertible,"On the 17th of February 2023, GM introduced the first electrified Corvette exactly seven decades after the nameplate’s introduction at the 1953 Motorama in New York City. The Corvette was the most notorious American sports car. Chevrolet made it with a front engine and rear-wheel-drive for almost all those 70 years, but times changed. In 2020, the automaker launched the eighth generation of the Corvette with a mid-mounted engine. It was the most revolutionary change in the model’s history. Then, in January 2023, Chevrolet introduced the E-Ray. It introduced two other significant upgrades: drivetrain electrification and an all-wheel-drive system. This hybrid version not only used an electric motor to improve the vehicle’s performance but also to increase its fuel efficiency. Throughout its history, the Corvette has always been granted an open-top version, so the eighth generation followed the same principle. Besides the coupe, Chevrolet also made the vehicle with a retractable roof that was available on most engine versions, including the E-Ray. The car’s front featured a lower splitter under the bumper with a center intake and two side scoops that flanked it. The triangular-shaped headlights were adorned by the integrated LED daytime running lights that ran on the upper and outer sides. From its profile, the C8 Corvette convertible featured a short nose followed by a raked windshield. Behind the seats, the automaker placed two bulges that concealed the safety arches and the retractable roof mechanism. Between them, on the engine’s cover, Chevrolet added a set of vents that helped to cool the engine. Behind that, on the deck, the Corvette E-Ray Convertible sported a small spoiler that increased downforce. With its modern cockpit made for two, the American supercar created a luxurious and sporty environment for its customers. The two high-bolstered seats were separated by a tall center console, while in front of the driver was a digital instrument cluster. In addition, atop the center stack, GM added a touchscreen for the infotainment system, which the driver could control via a turning knob and a few buttons placed next to the gear selector’s buttons. The driver could cover or open the top at speeds of up to 30 mph (50 kph). But E-Ray’s most significant upgrade compared to its stablemates was found under its skin. Regardless of whether it was in the coupe or roadster shape, the car featured an electrified drivetrain. GM installed the 6.2-liter LT2 V8 engine that powered the rear wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission. At the same time, the front wheels were moved by a 160 hp (162 PS) motor. The total output power obtained reached 655 hp (664 PS). But the E-Ray Convertible could do something more than just help the car get a 2.5-second 0 to 60 mph (0-97 kph) sprint. It could also cruise in “Stealth Mode” via the electric motor only at speeds of up to 45 mph (72 kph).

CHEVROLET Corvette Z06,"Chevrolet continued the Corvette saga with the introduction of the Z06 version for the C8. Thus, when most carmakers were concerned about electrification, the American carmaker indulged itself with another extreme version of their supercar. One of the most influential people in the Corvette evolution was Zora Arkus-Duntov. He created a particular version for the 1963 model with a fuel-injected V8 that offered 360 hp. It was a high value for those times. Fast forward to 2022, and the C8 generation came as the supercar envisioned by the brilliant engineer: a mid-mounted engine and a more powerful version: the 2022 Z06. On the outside, the Z06 featured a wider stance by 3.6” (9.4 cm) than its Stingray sibling. At the front, a redesigned bumper sported a wider air-intake for enhanced cooling. From its sides, the 20” front and 21” light-alloy-wheels wore Michelin Cup 2 R ZP tires. At the same time, the carmaker placed an adjustable wing at the back for improved cornering speed and handling. The interior featured a similar design with the rest of the stable, but GM added a carbon-fiber trim package. Thus, it completed the overall race-inspired experience for the two occupants of the cockpit. Behind the cabin, GM installed a state-of-the-art naturally aspirated V8 engine. Named LT6, the 5.5-liter powerplant developed the highest power for any atmospheric V8s ever installed in a production vehicle to that date. The engine sent its 670 hp to the rear wheels via an eight-speed (dual-clutch) automatic gearbox. The final drive offered a 5.56 ratio, made for enhanced acceleration times.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Corvette Z06"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""wider stance by 3.6” (9.4 cm)"",  ""overall-design"": [""race-inspired"", ""mid-mounted engine"", ""powerful"", ""wide stance"", ""adjustable wing""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""redesigned"", ""wider""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""redesigned"", ""wider air-intake""],    ""wheel"": [""20” front"", ""21” rear"", ""light-alloy"", ""Michelin Cup 2 R ZP tires""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""adjustable""],    ""exhaust"": [""state-of-the-art"", ""naturally aspirated"", ""rear-mounted""]  }}```"
CHEVROLET Corvette ZR1,"The 2018 ZR1 was the most powerful Corvette ever made to that date and also the most technologically advanced. Corvette had a long history behind it. Even though its first generation was not the most powerful car on the market, its successors started to grow and develop more power and torque. They became more and more athletic and sportier. The 2018 model was also the last Corvette with the engine mounted in the front. It might be called the last classic ZR1 model. Unlike its siblings, the ZR1 was easy to spot due to its hole in the hood and the carbon-fiber case for the supercharger. The engine was so tall that it couldn't fit in the engine bay, so the designers made a cut and passed it through. If the track-package was installed, the car featured various carbon-fiber elements at the front and on the sides, plus a massive wing on the back. It was mounted on the rear panel, not on the trunk-lid. Its light-alloy wheels were unique for the ZR1, with 19"" at the front and 20"" for the rear axle. Inside, Chevrolet tried to make things better than before. There was no cheap plastic anymore. Depending on the options, the ZR1 could have been fitted with Alcantara on the ceiling. Its regular sport-bucket seats could have been replaced with the race-bucket ones, which featured integrated headrests and passages for a four-point harness. The 2018 ZR1 featured an adaptive dampers system with magnetorheological shocks. The electronically controlled Limited Slip Differential helped the car corner faster than any other Corvette in history. Its 6.2-liter supercharged engine produced a massive 765 hp and 969 Nm (715 lb-ft) of torque, which were sent to the rear wheels via a 7-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic gearbox.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Corvette ZR1"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""athletic and sporty"",  ""overall-design"": [""powerful"", ""technologically advanced"", ""athletic"", ""sporty"", ""unique""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""holed"", ""carbon-fiber""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""19\"" front, 20\"" rear"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""massive wing"", ""rear-mounted""],    ""exhaust"": [""electronically controlled""]  }}```"
CHEVROLET Silverado 2500HD,"Chevrolet unveiled its flagship Silverado model, the HD ZR2, based on the 2500 HD series, but with additional goodies that made the rugged truck ready to tackle serious offroad situations. The American automaker made its customers wait more than a year after introducing the ZR2 version for the 1500 model before unleashing the mighty HD ZR2. But in 2023, it finally happened. The bow-tie brand released the 2500-based top-of-the-range model built for those who wanted a capable truck ready to carry a full-size camper in a remote area. For any Chevy fan, it was an instantly recognizable ZR2 version of this truck. The broad black front grille and the ample arrow-shaped LED daytime running lights pointing inwards are specific for this model. In addition, the steel bumper and the recovery tow hooks were significant enhancements for the vehicle. For the ZR2 Bison, these were painted in black, while the regular HD ZR2 had them red. Since the vehicle was offroad-oriented, it was fitted with black, 18"" alloy wheels wrapped in MT tires. Inside, on the other hand, it had all the comfort features needed for a daily and the technological updates required by a 2023 truck. A 13.4"" touchscreen was placed atop the center stack for the infotainment system. At the same time, the automaker installed a 12.3"" display in front of the driver, inside the instrument cluster. Last but not least, a 15"" head-up display added the required information for offroading. Since Chevy built this version to pull heavy loads on rough terrains, it installed powerful engines underneath the HD ZR2's hood. Customers could have it with either a gasoline or a turbodiesel engine mated with a ten-speed auto. In addition, both versions were fitted with aluminum and steel undercarriage protections and a rear locking differential.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Silverado HD ZR2"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""full-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""offroad-ready"", ""capable"", ""recognizable"", ""comfortable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""black""],    ""hood"": [""steel""],    ""headlights"": [""arrow-shaped"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""steel"", ""painted"", ""black/red""],    ""wheel"": [""black"", ""18-inch"", ""alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CHEVROLET Colorado Extended Cab,"When the GM and Isuzu joined their forces to built reliable workhorses on four wheels, they also agreed who will sell where. And the GM had the U.S. This is how Chevrolet Colorado ended up having the same chassis as an Isuzu D-Max. The Chevrolet Colorado was the kind of truck that could be used as a daily driver and a weekend companion. The 2015 model received the ""corner step"" introduced for the first trim in the Chevrolet Silverado, which had sculpted steps inside the rear bumper to help climbing in and out of the bed. The front fascia was flat and tall. The Extended Cab was available with a 6 feet bed. (1.82 m) and it could tow up to 6,700 pounds (3,039 kg). The Extended Cab had two rear-hinged doors that provided access to the rear seats. Those were moreover large enough to install child-seats since the legroom was virtually none. Inside, the dashboard was closer to an SUV than to a utility truck. And the vehicle was good to serve well for both purposes. In the center console, a new infotainment system was installed and was able to connect via Android Auto and Apple CarPlay with virtually any smartphone. Under the hood, Colorado had three engine choices, depending on the market. The standard model featured a 2.5-liter gasoline engine, while the top version had a 3.6-liter V6 unit installed. Both were mated as standard with a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic was available as an option. In some countries, there was a 2.8-liter Duramax turbodiesel engine.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Chevrolet Colorado"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""Mid-size truck"",  ""overall-design"": [""Reliable"", ""Versatile"", ""Functional"", ""Sculpted"", ""Tall""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""Flat""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""Sculpted""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""Rear-hinged"", ""Sculpted"", ""Functional""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""Rear-hinged""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CHEVROLET Colorado Double Cab,"The new 2024 Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 Bison represents the most off-road enhanced version of the truck in the Colorado model's 20 years of existence, as it is made in partnership with American Expedition Vehicles (AEV) and is meant to conquer any terrain. The vehicle is propelled by a standard 2.7-liter Turbo DOHC engine with a maximum output of 310 hp and an 8-speed automatic transmission. The powertrain must be well-optimized to ensure enough power to the wheels when encountering an obstacle on the off-road path. To use the most out of the engine's capabilities, the truck has a 2-speed transfer case and all-wheel drive provided by power-locking front and rear differentials. With help from all these features, the truck has a payload of 1050 lbs and a maximum towing capacity of 5500 lbs. The collaboration with American Expedition Vehicles imposes a few features that elevate the Chevrolet to new heights in off-roading. The AEV heavy-duty winch-capable front bumper allows the vehicle to unlock itself from situations where the wheels don't provide any movement at all through the winch capability of adding another traction point. The AEV 17-inch beadlock-capable wheels offer the best possible support for the structure of the 35-inch mud/terrain tires when deflated to help with the crossing of a significant obstacle. The best-in-class approach, departure, and breakover angles, alongside the 12.2-inch ground clearance, are enhanced by the boron steel skid plates and rocker underbody protection that offer the driver enough courage to adventure even in the most hostile wilderness, knowing that the truck cannot be damaged from underneath. To quickly navigate through different terrains and help maintain the wheels in contact with the ground for as long as possible to offer a better grip, the Colorado ZR2 Bison is equipped with segment-exclusive Multimatic front and rear Jounce Control Dampers. Other than increased stability, the suspension has an extensive range of motion that helps with keeping the truck level even on the most deformed surfaces. From a visual perspective, the truck has AEV rear bumper, fender flares, and badged headrests that underline the truck's unicity and distinctive features. Combining the good looks with practicability, the Chevy has a racing-inspired tire carrier and spray-on bedliner, as every pickup truck should. The specific Chevrolet ""flowtie"" crowns the front part of the car and highlights its Bison exterior identification. In terms of technology, the truck comes standard with the Chevy Safety Assist, a suite of all the essential safety technologies implemented on modern vehicles, such as Automatic Emergency Braking, Front Pedestrian Braking, Lane Keep Assist with Lane Departure Warning, Following Distance Indicator, Forward Collision Alert and IntelliBeam auto high beam control. It also provides an interesting user experience through its 11.3-inch infotainment touchscreen system with built-in Google.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 Bison"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""Mid-size truck"",  ""overall-design"": [""Off-road enhanced"", ""Rugged"", ""Distinctive"", ""Practical"", ""Aggressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""Distinctive"", ""Bold""],    ""hood"": [""Rugged"", ""Functional""],    ""headlights"": [""Sleek"", ""Modern""],    ""bumper"": [""Heavy-duty"", ""Winch-capable""],    ""wheel"": [""17-inch beadlock-capable""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""High-performance""]  }}```"
CHEVROLET Impala,"Chevrolet introduced the tenth generation of the Impala in 2013 as a 2014 model-year on the same platform as the Cadillac XTS and the Buick LaCrosse. After parting with Opel and Saab, GM kept the Epsilon II platform in both versions with a short or long wheelbase. It was designed in Germany for front-wheel-drive vehicles and adapted in Sweden to support all-wheel-drive ones. Its most extended form complied with GM demands for a pre-premium car. Chevrolet insisted on a fastback-like bodywork, similar to the one from the Opel/Vauxhall Insignia. Its sculptured side panels and the arched line over the rear wheels emphasized a sport-sedan image since it played in the big-car league against Honda Accord or Toyota Camry. Its headlights came fitted as standard with HID lamps and LED daytime running lights for selected trim levels. Inside, the design team benefited from the long wheelbase and installed thick bucket seats at the front and a comfortable bench profiled for two full-grown adults in the back. The tall center tunnel made life difficult for a third passenger, and the carmaker didn't even bother to install a third headrest. While the base trim-levels sported cloth seats, on the upper versions, the interior was leather-wrapped. Under the hood, Chevrolet offered the Impala with a choice of four engines, including a hybrid version. The carmaker offered the car with a standard six-speed automatic transmission for the entire range.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Impala"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": ""full-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""fastback-like bodywork"", ""sculptured side panels"", ""arched line over rear wheels"", ""sport-sedan image"", ""HID lamps and LED daytime running lights""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""sculptured""],    ""headlights"": [""HID"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""thick bucket seats"", ""comfortable bench""],    ""roof"": [""long wheelbase""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CHEVROLET Captiva,"Chevrolet tried its last shot to the European market with a re-badged version of the Opel Antara sold under the bow-tie brand with the Captiva name. In 2006, GM introduced a new compact SUV in various markets worldwide. It was sold under multiple brands, from Chevrolet to Vauxhall and Saturn. While in some countries the car made a good impression, in others it just didn't fit. Struggling in the aftermath of the world economic crisis, Chevrolet refreshed the Captiva worldwide, including in Europe. There was a new front fascia. Instead of the older, swept-back headlights with rounded edges, the 2011 model featured an angular, more masculine look. Antara's taller grille featured a horizontal slat that supported the bow-tie golden badge. In the back, the design team decided to install clear lenses over the taillights. Chevrolet improved the Captiva's cabin as well. The designers installed a new instrument cluster where the fuel gauge and the coolant temperature dial were positioned between the speedometer and tachometer. A new infotainment system found its place on top of the center stack, with an improved navigation system. GM updated the engines, and a new, 2.2-liter turbodiesel replaced the previous, 2.0-liter unit. It offered 34 more hp than its predecessor and, due to the new 6-speed automatic gearbox, it provided a lower fuel consumption. For the gasoline units, Chevrolet replaced the 3.2-liter gasoline unit with a newer, more powerful, 3.0-liter V6. But still, the car couldn't save the Chevrolet brand on the European market.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Captiva"",  ""year"": ""2011"",  ""size"": ""compact SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""angular"", ""masculine"", ""improved"", ""new"", ""refreshed""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""taller"", ""horizontal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back"", ""rounded"", ""angular""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CHEVROLET Cobalt Sedan,"Chevrolet ditched the Cobalt nameplate for U.S. customers but let it live in some other countries as a small-sized sedan for emerging countries. While still struggling to get back on its feet after the world financial crisis, the American automaker thought that using the same Gama II platform for the Cobalt as on the Sonic would lower production costs. The strategy partly worked, but the vehicle still had a steep price compared to its competitors. In addition, neither the car's exterior design nor the interior was something to write home about it. Sporting a set of headlights that resembled those installed on the Splash, the 2011 Cobalt was a three-box sedan with a clean design and nothing fancy on it. Still, the horizontal slat that featured the bow-tie badge was carefully adorned with chromed trims. On the lower bumper, depending on the options, the automaker also placed the fog lamps and a secondary, smaller grille. The Cobalt's profile revealed a three-box sedan shape, with slightly enlarged rear quarter panels that resembled those installed on the Renault/Dacia Logan. Inside, the materials' quality was low, with hard plastic areas on the dashboard, door panels, and other easy-to-reach areas. But Chevrolet gained some points in front of its customers thanks to the instrument cluster that featured a large analog dial for the tachometer and an LCD for the onboard computer and for the speedometer. In addition, the automaker offered an option for an infotainment system placed on the center stack above the HVAC control panel. At the front, the Cobalt sported slim bucket seats, while at the back, there was a split-folding (60/40) bench seat. Chevrolet offered the Cobalt's second generation with different engines, depending on the market. Thus, while the South American customers could get dual-fuel engines, in CSI (the Russian Federation) they could get the car with a turbo-diesel.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Cobalt"",  ""year"": ""2011"",  ""size"": ""small-sized sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""clean"", ""simple"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""horizontal"", ""chromed trims""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""resembling Splash""],    ""bumper"": [""lower placement"", ""fog lamps"", ""secondary grille""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CHEVROLET Express,"Chevrolet introduced the Express lineup in 1996 and created one of the best choices for the LCV market, and the passenger version offered room for fifteen people inside. The Express was like a Swiss-army knife. It could be a delivery van, a limousine, a school bus, or an office on wheels. GM made it available in three different GVWR levels labeled as 1500, 2500, or heavy-duty 3500. Chevrolet built it with two wheelbases so that it could fit everyone's needs. General Motors had over a century of experience in building utility vehicles, and that was noticeable. It was also a leading main supplier for car rental companies, and that included the U-Haul. The Express was specifically built for commercial use and designed in a form-follow-function idea. Its flat side panels made a great advertisement area for businesses. At the front, the carmaker installed a horizontal slat on the grille, sporting the bow-tie badge in the middle. Depending on the trim level and options, it offered wide headlights or smaller ones, both rectangular. In 2003, the carmaker added a refreshed version and in 2008 introduced more safety features. It included curtain airbags and GM's StabiliTrak (ESP) as standard. In addition, the carmaker added a new audio system on the industrial-looking dashboard to improve comfort, which included a 6-CD in-dash unit and Bluetooth connectivity. Under the hood, depending on the GVWR, it provided a range of four gasoline engines. Chevrolet exclusively offered the 6.6-liter turbo-diesel on the 3500 version.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Chevrolet Express"",  ""year"": ""1996"",  ""size"": ""LCV"",  ""overall-design"": [""versatile"", ""utilitarian"", ""commercial"", ""industrial"", ""spacious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""horizontal"", ""sporting"", ""bow-tie badge""],    ""hood"": [""flat""],    ""headlights"": [""wide"", ""rectangular""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CHEVROLET Tracker,"Based on the same platform as the Chevrolet Traxx or Opel Mokka, the Tracker was the small SUV offered by the bow-tie brand on the South-American market. The same name was used for the Russian market. The Brazilian name was kept after a long line of Chevrolet Tracker / Geo Tracker. While its predecessor was based on the Suzuki Vitara, the 2013 model was based on the Chevrolet Traxx. Using a small-car platform, but upgrading it to a small cross-over wasn't a bad idea for Chevrolet. The vehicle was easy to build in various locations in the world, including in Mexico facilities for the South-American continent. The front fascia of the vehicle looked more aggressive than on other markets, to mimic a bigger vehicle even though the car was more of a crossover than an SUV. The interior was good enough for five passengers, but with limited room in the rear. Its trunk could hold up to 1372 liters (48.3 cu-ft) of space, with the rear seats folded. For driving aids, the car featured ABS with electronic brake-distribution (EBD), traction control and ESP. For the comfort features, there was a bigger list with rear parking sensors, cruise control, power windows and locks, on-board computer and a USB + Bluetooth connectivity with the mobile phone. The drivetrain had only one engine option of a 1.8-liter engine that could be mated to a 6-speed automatic gearbox.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Chevrolet Tracker"",  ""year"": ""2013"",  ""size"": ""small crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive front fascia"", ""easy to build""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""aggressive""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CHEVROLET Corvette Z06 Convertible,"Chevrolet introduced the seventh generation of the Corvette in 2014, and one of its most powerful versions was the Z06, which was available as a coupe and a convertible, threatening the dominance of Italian supercars on U.S. soil. It was the last generation for the front-engined Corvettes, and the American automaker put a lot of effort into creating the best of this nameplate. As a result, the car was improved in every aspect and, moreover, it provided not just excellent performance but also a more attractive exterior and interior. In September 2013, Chevrolet introduced the seventh generation of this beloved nameplate. In the following year, and at the 2014 North American International Auto Show, the Corvette family grew with the addition of the Z06 version for the 2015 model year. The open-top version of the Z06 carried over most of its components from its coupe sibling. As a result, the front fascia sported swept-back headlights adorned with LED daytime running lights on their lower side in a boomerang shape. The bumper featured a broad black grille in the air dam and a splitter underneath it, which enhanced the car’s aerodynamics. Moreover, the hood had vents on it in front of a bulged area, suggesting that there was a bigger powerplant underneath, or at least a supercharger. From its profile, the functional vents behind the front wheel arches extracted the air trapped inside the wheel wells and decreased the aerodynamic lift of the car. Its raked windshield featured thick A-pillars that served as roll-over protection. Thanks to extensive usage of high-strength aluminum elements, the car was 20 percent stiffer than the C6 Z06 Coupe, meaning that there were no concerns regarding road holding. To cover or uncover the cabin, the driver didn’t need to stop the car; it could do that at the flick of a switch at speeds of up to 30 mph (50 kph). In addition, it could do that by pressing a button on the key fob when the vehicle was parked. Corvette was often criticized for its poorly built interiors, but the C7 was different. GM asked Chevrolet to create a highly competitive vehicle in all aspects, and that included the cabin. As a result, the C7 Z06 featured a Mullan or Nappa leather-wrapped interior (depending on the grade) with high-bolstered bucket seats that could keep their occupants in place during high-speed cornering. The dashboard layout was similar to its siblings and featured a wide rev counter in the middle flanked by a speedometer on the left and the fuel and temperature gauges on the right. On the center stack, Chevrolet added a touchscreen for the infotainment system, which didn’t look like it was an off-the-shelf product. Furthermore, the center console housed a rotary dial that controlled it. Still, customers were mostly attracted by what happened under the hood. There, Chevy dropped the LT4 supercharged engine that produced 650 HP (659 PS) and a massive torque of 650 lb-ft (850 Nm) paired to either an eight-speed automatic transmission or an unusual Tremec seven-speed manual gearbox. All the oomph went to the rear wheels via an electronically controlled limited-slip differential.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Corvette"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": ""n/a"",  ""overall-design"": [""attractive"", ""aggressive"", ""aerodynamic"", ""functional"", ""high-performance""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked"", ""thick A-pillars""],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""black""],    ""hood"": [""vented"", ""bulged""],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back"", ""LED"", ""boomerang-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [""aerodynamic"", ""splitter""],    ""wheel"": [""functional vents"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""doors"": [""high-bolstered"", ""leather-wrapped""],    ""roof"": [""convertible"", ""uncoverable""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CHEVROLET Spin,"When an emerging market needs a cheap, affordable, seven-seat vehicle, the last concern is the exterior design, and the Chevrolet Spin was just one proof of that. While it might look easy to design a cheap car, it is actually pretty hard. The designer needs to know how much material will be included in the stamping, and if there are too many curves involved, more material will be used, and the final product will be more expensive. With a tall-looking profile and a front fascia that resembled the Chevrolet Spark, the Spin was never produced to impose respect or win a beauty contest. But its designers still managed to install a cross-bar over the radiator's grille to place the bow-tie Chevrolet badge on it. The swept-back headlights resembled those found on the Chevrolet Cruze. The car was longer than a regular hatchback with an added volume behind the rear doors, with taillights that resembled those from the Bolt or Cruze hatchback. The interior was the one that mattered, and the Spin offered up to seven-seat inside. Maybe they were not the most comfortable ones, but at least could take the kids to the school and back. The dashboard revealed the designer's imagination and proved to be more pleasant-looking. Its wave-like shape, and two-tone color scheme, made it look better. Depending on the option, a sat-nav infotainment unit was installed on top of the center stack. The instrument cluster featured a large dial for the tachometer and an LCD for the speedometer and the on-board computer readings. Under the Spin's hood, Chevrolet installed a choice of five engines, ranged from 86 hp to 108 hp. Depending on the market, the car could run on gasoline, diesel, or ethanol (for the South American Market).",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Chevrolet Spin"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""tall-looking profile"",  ""overall-design"": [""cheap"", ""affordable"", ""functional"", ""utilitarian""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""cross-bar"", ""front fascia""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""longer than regular hatchback"", ""added volume behind rear doors""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CHEVROLET Sonic RS,"Chevrolet added more flair to the subcompact Sonic and introduced a sporty version named RS as a 2013 model year, with a European turbocharged heart and a few other tidbits to show its upgraded character. Aimed at the same customers as Honda Fit and Toyota Yaris, the small-sized Sonic made its debut on the American market in 2011, based on the Gamma II platform. It was more or less a badge-engineering product, sharing a big chunk of its parts with the European Chevrolet Aveo or the Australian Holden Barina. But the RS version was different. The Sonic RS featured an enhanced front fascia than the rest of the range. It sported chromed trims around the grille and the lower-mounted side scoops hosted the foglights. From its sides, the 17” light-alloy wheels. At the back, the roof spoiler and the rectangular exhaust tip adorned and completed the sporty image of the vehicle. Inside, the carmaker placed an RS-badged flat-bottom steering wheel. The black leather with red stitching and the aluminum sport pedals inspired a racy atmosphere. But these were no sports seats. In the engineering department, Chevrolet upgraded the old platform with stiffer suspension that promised to allow higher cornering speeds than its non-RS version. Under the hood, the carmaker planted a 1.4-liter turbocharged engine that provided about the same power as the naturally aspirated version of the Sonic. Yet, it offered a better torque. The transmission for this sporty-looking small-sized hatchback was a six-speed manual.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Sonic"",  ""year"": ""2013"",  ""size"": ""small-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""enhanced"", ""racy"", ""flair"", ""upgraded""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""chromed"", ""enhanced""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""17” light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": [""rectangular""]  }}```"
CHEVROLET Prisma,"GM needed a new affordable sedan for the South American market, and the most convenient way to make it was to take the Gamma II platform used for the European Opel Corsa and stuck a trunk behind it. Chevrolet took charge of the Brazilian market with two cars based on the same platform: the Onix and the Prisma. The former was a hatchback, while the latter was a sedan. While the hatchback was clearly addressed for younger people, the latter was more of a family vehicle. Still, the carmaker didn't want to make it looks like a cheap vehicle. At the front, the design team used the big, bold grille with a transverse bar in the middle where the golden bow-tie took center stage. The front fascia featured a pair of big, swept-back headlights extended over the front fenders, while the lower bumper sported a wide black area with a grille in the middle flanked by the fog lights. Inside, the Prisma offered room for up to five adults. Although there was little room for three passengers, they could share the space for in-city trips. Chevrolet offered an infotainment system with a seven-inch touch-screen. The carmaker didn't consider installing a coolant-temperature gauge in the instrument panel, using a blue-red warning light instead. The base model featured a 1.0-liter, 78 hp (80 when using ethanol) engine. Chevrolet installed a 1.4-liter unit for the top-spec version, which provided a 98 hp (or 106 when using ethanol) unit.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Chevrolet Prisma"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""compact sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""affordable"", ""family-oriented"", ""modern"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""big"", ""bold"", ""transverse"", ""center-stage""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""big"", ""swept-back"", ""extended""],    ""bumper"": [""wide"", ""black"", ""grille"", ""fog lights""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CHEVROLET Cruze Wagon,"Four years after the launch of the Cruze, the entire lineup received a well-deserved facelift, and the wagon version was added to the range. When Chevrolet launched the Cruze in 2008, it didn't consider making a station wagon version. But fast forward four years, and the carmaker understood that it had to do that from the beginning. For the 2012 model year, the car sported several upgrades on the front fascia, which received minor changes for the grille and the headlights. In addition, the front bumper lost its horizontal intakes. Instead, it gained a pair of much more dynamic vertical ones, placed on the outer sides, flanking a split-opening on the apron. After selling more than 1.2-million vehicles on the European market, the carmaker thought it could boost its sales with the station wagon, but it made it look appealing. Its ascending beltline and the racked-forward D-pillars made the car looks more like an extended hatchback than a regular estate vehicle. Inside, the wrapped around dashboard design surrounded the driver. Depending on the options, GM placed a new MyLink infotainment system on the center stack that included the navigation. At the same time, the less-equipped version featured just a CD stereo. A silver plastic trim covered the center console and encircled the air vents. In the back, the 60/40 split-folding bench increased the trunk from 500 liters (17.6 cu-ft) to 1,478 liters (52.2 cu-ft). Under the hood, GM dropped a range of engines carried over from its European sibling, the Opel Astra. Thus, the base version featured a 124 hp 1.6-liter naturally aspirated, while the top of the range model received a 1.4-liter turbocharged powerplant. In addition, the carmaker offered two engine choices for diesel fans, with 130 hp and 163 hp, respectively.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Cruze"",  ""year"": ""2012"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""dynamic"", ""appealing"", ""extended hatchback"", ""wrapped around dashboard"", ""spacious trunk""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""minor"", ""dynamic""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""dynamic""],    ""bumper"": [""front"", ""vertical intakes""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""racked-forward D-pillars""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CHEVROLET Onix,"Created as a successor for the Chevrolet Corsa, the Onix shared the same platform with the Aveo/Sonic or the European Opel/Vauxhall Corsa. Chevrolet had a vital market on the South American continent, and the Onix deserved some credits for that. It was a vehicle designed for that region, and the result was surprisingly good. It was Brazil's best selling car between 2015 and 2020. And it did that even though it faced stiff competition. The design was a mix between a European new-edge style and the sharp lines of the Chevrolet Sonic/Aveo. Unlike its older sibling, it featured one-piece headlamps and a taller grille. On the lower side of the bumper, GM installed a set o fog-lights and a broad grille. The greenhouse was unusually short when compared to the total car's height. Inside, the instrument cluster resembled the same used in the Sonic/Aveo, with a big, analog tachometer and a digital speedometer shown on an LCD. The center stack featured an option for an infotainment system, which was upgraded later on with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. It offered two bucket seats at the front while a bench with a split-folding seatback was fitted as standard. Under the hood, GM installed a specific engine for the South American markets. Apart from the two gasoline units carried over from the Aveo, the carmaker installed a pair of two gas engines. Depending on the trim level and options, a 6-speed automatic was on the options list.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Onix"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""European new-edge style"", ""sharp lines"", ""short greenhouse""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""short""],    ""grille"": [""taller""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""one-piece""],    ""bumper"": [""broad""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""two bucket seats""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CHEVROLET Corvette E-Ray,"Seven decades after the introduction of the first Corvette in 1953 at the Motorama, the bow-tie brand unleashed the first hybrid version of this American sports car. Zora Duntov tried to convince GM's management in the early '70s that a mid-mounted powerplant would create a better sports car, but the automaker didn't want to hear about that. Finally, in 2019, the automaker moved the engine behind the cabin. That affected the entire car's design. In addition, it created enough room for installing an electric motor on the front axle. At first sight, it was the same C8 Corvette, but there were several details that split apart the ICE-only version from the hybrid one. The E-Ray featured a new bumper that resembled the one offered on the Corvette Z06 but without canards. On the sides, the body-colored air intakes were similar to those installed on the regular Stingray C8 and also sported the E-Ray badge on them. It was not big, but just enough to signal the different version. Finally, at the back, the hybrid Corvette featured four exhausts, two on each side of the car, flanking a center diffuser. Inside, like the rest of its siblings, the E-Ray featured a steering wheel with an up-arrow design for the two spokes. Inside, the cockpit looked similar to the rest of the range, with an LCD in front of the driver for the instrument cluster and a second display placed atop the center stack. In addition, the tall center console covered the large battery pack used to power the vehicle. But the most significant change was under the skin. Beside the naturally-aspirated V8 engine placed in the back, the E-Ray also featured a 160 hp electric motor for the front wheels. Thus, it was an all-wheel-drive vehicle but tuned for performance. No wonder it was the quickest Corvette ever.",CHEVROLET,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Corvette"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""modern"", ""sporty"", ""aggressive"", ""innovative""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""angled""],    ""grille"": [""distinctive""],    ""hood"": [""sleek""],    ""headlights"": [""sleek"", ""angular""],    ""bumper"": [""new"", ""resembling Corvette Z06""],    ""wheel"": [""sporty""],    ""doors"": [""conventional""],    ""roof"": [""low-profile""],    ""diffusor"": [""centered""],    ""spoiler"": [""N/A""],    ""exhaust"": [""four"", ""flanking""]  }}```"
CHRYSLER 300,"The full-size Chrysler 300C has received a major change in 2014 and even if the overall look is about the same, underneath the surface there were a lot of differences. The Chrysler 300 has a long history in the American motor industry. For a long time, the name was burred until the DaimlerChrysler brought it back to life. And they took some parts from few Mercedes-Benz models and installed it into the “gangsta-style” Chrysler 300. The styling, with a high belt-line and a low roof, was kept after Fiat cut a deal and took-over the Chrysler Group forming FCA. But they added some improvements such as the LED daytime running lights (DRL), bigger brakes, new interior and lighter components for the old, but good, Mercedes-Benz suspension system. Inside, there was a new instrument cluster, with a small color display between the tachometer and speedometer. On the central console, the new infotainment unit featured a standard 7” color display that featured the Uconnect system. The system can be upgraded to an 8.4” display and a better sound system. Under the hood, there was a revolution. The FCA installed the best technology it could fit inside. The Chrysler 300 featured a V6 or a V8 engine. Both were mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission, compared to the 5-speed offered by Mercedes-Benz on the previous generation. Another interesting option is the gear-selector, which is a rotary knob. On top of that, the 2014 Chrysler 300 was available with an all-wheel-drive system.",CHRYSLER,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Chrysler 300C"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": ""full-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""long history"", ""high belt-line"", ""low roof"", ""gangsta-style"", ""LED daytime running lights""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""high""],    ""grille"": [""stylish""],    ""hood"": [""sleek""],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""imposing""],    ""wheel"": [""bigger""],    ""doors"": [""solid""],    ""roof"": [""low""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CHRYSLER Pacifica,"At the 2020 Chicago Auto Show, Chrysler showed its new 2021 Pacifica minivan. Even if it isn't a completely new vehicle, the updated version has enough features to be praised. For starters, there are new headlights, crafted with a more aggressive, linear design. The standard new LED headlamps deliver a better light projection and stand out boldly thanks to new daytime running lights (DRL). New 20"" light-alloy-wheels are available, depending on the four different trim levels. Pacifica offers also LED foglights. Inside, the 2021 Pacifica offers more features than before. It even has a famCAM, which is a camera focused on the rear seats. It can also be zoomed to seats and monitors the rear-facing child seats. The image can be shown on a 10.1"" touch-screen display fitted on the dashboard. On the connectivity side, there is a Uconnect 5 system, which has its own application for smartphones, but it can be also connected via Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The 2021 Chrysler Pacifica has two engine options. One is a V6 engine and the other is a PHEV version. The plug-in hybrid has a 3.6-liter gasoline unit paired with an electric motor and offers up to 48 km (30 miles) of electric range. The Pacifica Hybrid may be fully recharged via the 6.6-kWh on-board charger in as little as two hours using a 240-volt (Level 2) charger, available from Mopar through dealers. The V6 only version has 287 hp and it is mated to a 9-speed automatic gearbox.

CHRYSLER 300C,"Chrysler brought back the 300 C nameplate at the 2022 Detroit Auto Show and shook the audience with this four-door performance vehicle. Despite all odds and the electrification trend that conquered the automotive industry, Chrysler dared to roll out from the assembly line a special 300C. The production started with a limited series of 2000 units that were sold even before the vehicle was officially unveiled at the show in Chrysler's booth. From the outside, it didn't look that much different than its predecessor. But there were some substantial changes, such as the new front bumper that hosted the LED foglamps at the bottom. Moreover, the black mesh grille surrounded by piano-black accents around it and the unique 300C badge on it looked bold. In addition, the flared wheel fenders hinted that there was something special underneath the hood. Inside, Chrysler installed a mixed instrument cluster with analog speedometer and tachometer and a TFT between them for the onboard computer. The dashboard continued with a center stack that hosted the 8.4"" Uconnect infotainment unit on its top and the HVAC control unit at the bottom. Both front seats were bolstered and featured the 300 C emblem embroidered on the front of the seatbacks. At the same time, the rear bench was profiled for two, and due to the low greenhouse, it was very challenging to host a third person in the middle. Under the hood, Chrysler installed its well-known 6.4-liter HEMI engine that was good for 485 hp and 475 lb-ft of torque and paired it with an eight-speed automatic transmission.",CHRYSLER,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""300C"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""bold"", ""performance-oriented"", ""limited-edition""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black"", ""mesh"", ""piano-black accents""],    ""hood"": [""flared""],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""new"", ""front""],    ""wheel"": [""flared""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""low greenhouse""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""6.4-liter HEMI""]  }}```"
CITROEN C3 Aircross,"Citroen introduced a facelifted version for the C3 Aircross at the beginning of 2020 and upgraded its engines and safety systems to comply with the Euro6d norms. The C3 Aircross was introduced on the market in 2017 and was sold in over 330.000 units by 2020 when it was refreshed. It was a very successful vehicle for the French carmaker, and it proved its qualities as an all-around car. Its crossover-style, fuel-efficient engines, and decent interior made it a good choice in its price range. Citroen built its small-segment crossover on the same platform as the C3 lineup. Its bodywork featured black plastic moldings around the wheel arches and side sills. At the front, the carmaker installed a redesigned bumper with a broader lower grille that sported a silver lower area that mimicked an aluminum shield. Its new LED lights were even slimmer than before, and that didn't make it look better. On its sides, the carmaker dropped the airbumps protection panels, which worked well against parking bumps with shopping carts. Inside, the most important upgrade was for the seats, which were thicker than before, enhancing the comfort. A new 9"" touch-screen took center stage on the dashboard. It featured Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity that helped the driver navigate, play music, or take calls without removing the hands from the wheel. In the back, a 40/20/40 split-folding bench could have increased the trunk space from 410 liters (14.5 cu-ft) to 1289 liters (45.5 cu-ft). Under the hood, Citroen installed its new engines upgraded to the latest pollution standards. The carmaker paired them as standard to a 6-speed manual, while an automatic transmission was available for selected versions.",CITROEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""C3 Aircross"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""small-segment crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""crossover-style"", ""fuel-efficient"", ""decent interior""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broader"", ""silver lower area""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""new LED"", ""slimmer""],    ""bumper"": [""redesigned"", ""broader""],    ""wheel"": [""black plastic moldings""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CITROEN C4 Cactus,"The Citroen C4 Cactus crossover was launched in 2014 and its styling was not quite popular. The French manufacturer tried to fix that with a major facelift in 2018. The car-manufacturers adapted fast for what the market asked for. And the market asked for crossover vehicles instead of station-wagons. Even some hatchbacks were ruled out by the new trend in automotive design. The C4 Cactus came with a nice offer of higher ground clearance but with the dimensions of a small vehicle. Citroen always had a different approach to car design. They didn't follow the trend and, sometimes, that paid off. The 2018 C4 Cactus had a raked front fascia, compared with the non-facelift version that had a bold, almost vertical, front end. The DRL lights were mounted above the headlights, above the beltline. Inside, there was room for five adults, and, due to a flat rear floor, it was easy to fit three people on the backseat. The trunk was rather small, but the rear seats featured folding backseat in a split 60:40 mode. The 2014 Cactus was in one piece. Unusual for the rear doors were the pop-out hinged windows. They couldn't be rolled down, but just open slightly outwards. The driver had two screens to look at: the instrument cluster was a screen and then was the infotainment unit, on top of the center console. It served also as the main command for other functions such as the climate control system. It also featured Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. There was a wide choice of small engines and transmissions. Since more than 75% crossovers sold in Europe at that time were FWD vehicles, Citroen didn't bother to install an all-wheel-drive system on the Cactus.",CITROEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""C4 Cactus"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""unique"", ""crossover"", ""compact"", ""modern"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [""bold"", ""vertical""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""mounted above beltline""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""small""],    ""doors"": [""rear pop-out hinged windows""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CITROEN C3,"The battle for the small-sized urban electric crossover was amplified in late 2023 when Citroen introduced the e-C3 in its lineup, challenging the best-selling nameplate in the segment, the Dacia Spring. Big automakers reacted slowly to the new EV revolution, but after they established all their workflows and procedures, their reaction was powerful. One of these automakers was Citroen. Even though the French car manufacturer was already present on the market with a few electric and electrified versions, it didn’t cover one of the most active segments: small-sized crossovers. There, Renault enjoyed strong sales thanks to its sub-brand Dacia from Romania. That vehicle was built in China and sold in Europe with excellent results. Unlike its competitor, Citroen made the e-C3 in Europe to shorten the logistic chain. Furthermore, the ë-C3 was built on the Stellantis “Smart Car” platform, which could also get an internal combustion engine since the battery pack was underneath the rear seats. The 2023 e-C3 was the first production model that sported the new old badge used by the French automaker between 1919 and 1932 and then again between 1935 and 1959. The “double chevron” was chromed on a black background, making it more visible. On the almost flat front fascia, the automaker placed the headlights on the upper side and featured multiple LED blocks that created a 3D effect despite their even layout. On the bumper, the automaker created several cuts and air intakes to conceal that element’s height and adorned it with a silver trim on its lower that mimicked an underbody shield. From its profile, the B-segment vehicle revealed a tall greenhouse with black B- and C-pillars and a tilted-forward D-pillar. At the back, the e-C3 had a set of taillights that replicated the design of the headlights, although with red LEDs. Finally, the rear bumper was mostly black but with a light-gray trim on its bottom. Inside, the vehicle was very spacious for the front occupants, thanks to the tall greenhouse. The dashboard looked more like a shelf, with the instrument cluster placed far from the driver at the bottom of the windshield. In addition, the automaker offered a head-up display and a 10.25” touchscreen placed in the middle, in a free-floating position. The flat seats were designed mostly for comfort and had very little side bolstering. In the back, Citroen used the “sofa-design” concept when it made the bench seat and offered a split-folding (60/40) seatback only as an option. But the most significant part of the car was the platform. It featured a system named Progressive Hydraulic Cushions that greatly enhanced comfort. Unlike all other cars on the market, the e-C3 had the dampers mounted on the bodywork via progressive hydraulic bump stops. As a result, there were fewer shocks felt by the car’s occupants. Under the hood, Citroen installed a 113 PS (111 hp) that offered the car an 11-second acceleration from 0 to 100 kph (0-62 mph). The 44 kWh LFP (Lithium-Iron Phosphate) battery pack ensured the vehicle a 320 km (199 miles) range. Owners could replenish the energy from up to 100 kW charging stations.",CITROEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""e-C3"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""small-sized urban electric crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""spacious"", ""modern"", ""efficient"", ""stylish"", ""comfortable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""tall"", ""angled""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""flat""],    ""headlights"": [""upper placement"", ""3D LED blocks""],    ""bumper"": [""multiple cuts"", ""silver trim""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""tall greenhouse"", ""tilted-forward D-pillar""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CITROEN E-Mehari,"50 years after the release of the 60’s Mehari, Citroen revived the nameplate and attributed it to a convertible body with four seats and 100% electric operation. One year before the E-Mehari was released, the Chevron presented a concept car - the Cactus M Concept, a cross between a C4 Cactus and the Mehari from the sixties. However, the new model had nothing to do with it. In Paris, the Autolib public car-sharing service of electric cars offered the BlueCar vehicles, supplied by Vincent Bollore and designed by Pininfarina. Getting closer to the roots of the E-Mehari, the business man Vincent Bollore launched an electric beach vehicle based on his BlueCar, namely the Bluesummer. An evolution of the Bollore BlueSummer, the E-Mehari was a good deal for both Citroen and Bollore, Citroen not needing to build the E-Mehari from scratch, taking only 8 months to design the convertible. In 2018, the Citroen E-Mehari was updated and got a new optional hardtop, new exterior paint colors, new interior materials and a redesigned dashboard. Aesthetically, the E-Mehari was not very different from the BlueSummer. With the wheel arches underlined with raw plastics and the raised ground clearance, the 4-seater gave a rather “buggy” spirit. Inside, the Hawaiian print inspired by the upholstery found in the BlueSummer was unusual, with the seats covered in Neoprene, the same material used for wetsuits. It was waterproof and was easy to wash even under running water as it dried quickly. The mechanical base was the same as the BlueSummer’s, with an electric motor mated with an automatic gearbox and a battery pack located under the floor. Despite having limited power up to 68 hp and a body weight of 1,405 kg, the E-Mehari had a strong acceleration thanks to the immediately available maximum torque. Having a combined range of 195 km, the E-Mehari could be fully charged in 10.5 hours with a 16A system and in 16.5 hours  with a 10A system.",CITROEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Citroen E-Mehari"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""4-seater"",  ""overall-design"": [""electric"", ""convertible"", ""beach-inspired"", ""buggy-spirit"", ""Hawaiian-print""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raised""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""raised""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""arches underlined with raw plastics""],    ""doors"": [""4-seater""],    ""roof"": [""optional hardtop""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CITROEN Berlingo,"The third generation of the Citroen Berlingo was released in 2018 and came with big improvements across the range. From the utilitarian vehicle adapted for passenger transportation it became a true MPV without forgetting its roots as a compact utility vehicle. It still has the same shape with a high roof and sliding doors on the side, but it doesn't look like it belongs to a warehouse anymore. The French stylists made it with short overhangs and a high front profile, like an SUV. It can be fitted with Xenon headlights and has standard LED daytime running lights (DRL). Taking their inspiration from the world of furniture and travel, the designers developed the interior of new Berlingo to be functional and high quality. They used soft-touch and warm materials to make occupants feel good. The interior is available with new trim and a varied set of colors corresponding to several interior ambiances. Since the platform is the same as the one from the Peugeot 308 passenger car, the ride is smoother. The available engines are a 1.2-liter gasoline engine with 110 hp mated to a 6-speed manual gearbox and another 1.2-liter turbo with 130 hp mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission. For diesel fans, there is also a 1.5 liter in three outputs versions: 75 hp, 100 hp, and 130 hp, respectively. The latter can be mated to an 8-speed automatic gearbox.

CITROEN C4 Picasso,"The 2016 Citroen C4 Picasso represents the facelift of the second generation of the C4 Picasso that was launched in 2013. The model also comes in the Citroen Grand C4 Picasso version, having a lengthened wheelbase and providing more space to have a third row of seats in the back of the car. The Grand variant also has a lot more cargo space as it has a capacity of approximately 700 liters, 150 more than the standard version. Besides the various gasoline and diesel engine inherited from the pre-facelift model, the 2016 C4 Picasso has a new PureTech 1.2-liter turbocharged three-cylinder gasoline engine that comes packaged with an EAT6 six-speed automatic transmission. The front of the car is completely redesigned and displays numerous chrome inserts that give the vehicle a modern look, helping also to highlight the key features of the front end. There is also a different approach for the back of the Citroen, with redesigned taillights offering a unique 3D look that further enhances the futuristic aspect of the car. More customization options are offered through the new color palette for the exterior of the C4 Picasso and through the optional five-spoke 17-inch diamond-finish alloy wheels that come in multiple colors. An optional two-tone black roof can create a contrast to underline the shapes and colors of the body elements. The interior updates didn't disappoint, as the facelift model has four new designs available, each coming with unique colors, materials, and features. The variants include options like massaging seats, second-row solar blinds, and ambient fragrance dispensers combined with materials like Nappa leather. To further increase comfort, the Citroen has upgraded suspension to provide more stability and also has an electric power steering system that lowers the vibrations propagated to the interior. The rear axle is acoustically isolated to reduce the noise transmitted toward the passengers. As a stand-out feature of the model, the panoramic glass roof offers improved visibility for all the passengers and makes the interior of the Citroen C4 Picasso feel way more significant than it is. The facelift also comes with technologically advanced features, such as a seven-inch touchscreen meant to improve accessibility and provide a canvas for the 3D CITROËN Connect Nav navigation system. As technology isn't limited to the vehicle's interior, the Citroen also adds the Hands-Free Tailgate system that enables the trunk's opening with a movement of the foot in case the hands are unavailable.

CITROEN Grand C4 Picasso,"Reaching its 2nd generation in 2016, the Grand C4 Picasso was unveiled for the first time in 2014. A highly practical and versatile compact MPV, the C4 Picasso had strong competitors, however, some of its features highly differentiated it from the others: the MPV almost floated over the road imperfections, the commanding driving position was excellent and the panoramic windshield provided high visibility. For 2016, the compact SUV became more efficient, more sophisticated, offered great space, safety and even cost effectiveness. With a variety of engine choices, the C4 Picasso suited the most picky buyers. A downsized 1.2-liter 3-cylinder Puretech turbo unit that developed 130 hp was more adequate for low mileage, while people looking for a more agile unit could choose between a 1.6-liter liter with 100 or 120 hp, respectively the most powerful available with the top-of-the-range, a 2.0-liter. Slight updates were brought to the exterior design, such as the smaller lower grille and the extra chrome trim across the daytime running lights. Behind the wheel, the dashboard was dominated by twin screen, the 12-inch panoramic HD panel replacing the normal set fo the conventional cluster gauges. Greatly suitable for larger families, the C4 Picasso offered a proper seating arrangement with 3 separate chairs in the back. As there was no central transmission tunnel, 3 adults could comfortably sit in the 2nd row. The 3rd row of seats was designed for kids, as adults would have little legroom and headroom available.",CITROEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Grand C4 Picasso"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""compact MPV"",  ""overall-design"": [""practical"", ""versatile"", ""sophisticated"", ""efficient"", ""cost-effective""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""panoramic"", ""high-visibility""],    ""grille"": [""smaller"", ""chrome-trim""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""daytime running""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CITROEN C1 3 Doors,"The PSA french group made a joint-venture with Toyota to build a small city car. The result was a trio: the Citroen C1-Peugeot 108-Toyota Aygo.

The C5 Estate (or Break) benefited from all that experience. The French brand introduced the second generation of that model in 2007 and, four years later, it enhanced it with a facelifted model. There was a new L-shaped LED strip for the daytime running lights on top of the front bumper at the front. The headlights were reshaped accordingly, featuring a straight lower line instead of the older version, with a slight interior step. The reversing lights from the taillights received clear lenses. Inside, there were just two buttons added, for the Citroen eTouch emergency system, in selected countries. That comprised a sim-card and a GPS module accessible via an SOS button for emergencies or a ""double-chevron"" button for other requests. The best part of the C5 Tourer was the rear adaptive suspension, available as an option. It could raise or lower the back of the car to ease-up loading and unloading. The same system was used to keep the car at the same level, regardless of the large trunk's added load. For the 2011 model, the French carmaker offered the C5 Estate with a choice of gasoline and diesel engines, all turbocharged. The car was available with a 5- or 6-speed manual transmission, while a 6-speed automatic was available on selected versions.",CITROEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""C5 Tourer"",  ""year"": ""2010"",  ""size"": ""mid-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""practical"", ""facelifted"", ""marvelous""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""reshaped"", ""L-shaped LED strip"", ""straight lower line""],    ""bumper"": [""front""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CITROEN C4,"Citroen introduced the C4 as a hatchback on the market in 2004, but later on, the compact-segment vehicle evolved into a crossover coupe that attracted a different type of customer. Just two years after the launch of the C4's third generation, the French brand unveiled the C4 X, trying to compete with some premium carmakers that also had crossover coupes on their lineups. Even though Citroen was more of a mass-market manufacturer, its ambitions to create upscale vehicles were still alive. While at the front, only a keen eye for detail could've spotted the differences between the regular C4 and the C4 X, the profile unveiled the longer profile. Since it shared the same wheelbase with its shorter sibling, only the rear overhang was extended. Moreover, the redesigned LED taillights featured a C-letter shape. At the back, the vehicle's cladding concealed the additional length. Inside, the carmaker installed an elegant interior with a technological update for the infotainment system. Wireless connectivity with smartphones was available, while the My Citroen Assist provided free geolocated emergency calls and emergency calls without a subscription. Since the vehicle featured a longer rear overhang, the trunk was increased and reached up to 510 liters (18 cu-ft) of space, with the rear seats up. Citroen offered the C4 X with a choice of three gasoline and one turbo-diesel unit ranging between 100 PS and 130 PS (98 and 128 HP), respectively.",CITROEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""C4 X"",  ""year"": ""2004"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""crossover coupe"", ""elegant interior"", ""technological update"", ""longer profile"", ""redesigned LED taillights""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""turbo-diesel""]  }}```"
CITROEN C5 X,"In a true Citroen fashion, the French carmaker delivered an unusually looking vehicle aimed to be its flagship. It combined a station wagon, a crossover, and a coupe all in one package of a mid-size segment car. After the dismissal of the C6 limousine in 2012, the carmaker kept only the C5 as a family sedan and flagship model. They had to admit that the luxury segment was no longer its asset, as in the past. Yet, it tried with the DS brand, which followed the same recipe as the Acura for Honda, Infiniti for Nissan, or Lexus for Toyota. But the C5 X unveiled a new approach, a transition towards a fully electric lineup. The C5 X featured a higher ground clearance and big wheels, unusual for a sedan or a regular station wagon. Yet, these sported narrow tires lower the rolling resistance and improve fuel efficiency. Under the hood, the carmaker installed a range of gasoline or hybrid powerplants, ditching the diesel option for it. The narrow, LED headlights were incorporated into the same line that crossed the front fascia, interrupted in the middle by the “double-chevron” badge. Its profile revealed a station wagon like a silhouette, with raked forward D-pillars and a set of spoilers. One was at the top of the tailgate and one at the waistline, in a Kamm-back design. The black plastic trims surrounding the wheel wells and the bottom of the front and rear bumpers amplified the SUV-like stance. Inside, the carmaker placed a TFT display inside the instrument cluster in front of the driver. A second screen sat atop the center stack and was used for the infotainment system. Finally, a tall center console separated the front occupants and served as a storage area and armrests. In addition, it served for the transmission and suspension settings. In the rear, a three-seat bench was installed for average-sized passengers, with enough leg- and headroom. The trunk provided 545 liters (19.2 cu-ft) of space, which could have been expanded to 1,640 liters (57.9 cu-ft) by completely folding down the rear seats.",CITROEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""C5 X"",  ""year"": ""unspecified"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""unusual"", ""electric"", ""sporty"", ""luxurious"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [""front fascia-integrated""],    ""hood"": [""unspecified""],    ""headlights"": [""narrow"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""SUV-like""],    ""wheel"": [""big""],    ""doors"": [""unspecified""],    ""roof"": [""station wagon-like""],    ""diffusor"": [""Kamm-back""],    ""spoiler"": [""top of tailgate"", ""waistline""],    ""exhaust"": [""unspecified""]  }}```"
CITROEN AMI,"The French manufacturer Citroen took the city-car to a different level with the introduction of the new AMI electric vehicle. The new pocket-car is even shorter than the first smart fortwo. With a total length of 2.41 meters (7.8 ft), a width of 1.39 meters (4.5 ft.) and a height of 1.52m (5 ft), it is very easy to drive around a crowded city. The short and tall vehicle has a weird way to open the doors, with a regular opening for the driver and a suicide-style for the passenger. Inside, there are only a few details to enhance the comfort: a hanger for a bag, a small screen as an instrument cluster and a dongle to hang and plug your smartphone, which then becomes the car's infotainment system. The side windows can be opened by manually tilting upwards like on the old 2 CV. The power comes from an electric motor fed by a 5.5 kWh lithium-ion battery installed under the floor. It can be completely charged in 3 hours from a regular 220v socket. It is conceived as a solution for urban mobility, better than an electric scooter or bicycle. Its range is 70 km (43.5 miles) and the top speed is just 45 kph (28 mph), enough for a daily commute and if the users don't turn on the heating. Yes, this little car has a heater! Citroen made this ultra-compact vehicle to be very cheap to buy and to use. A long term rental program was already started in France, allowing customers to place a EUR 2,644 downpayment and EUR 19.99/month rate for 48 months. For a full acquisition, the price is EUR 6000 (with a EUR 900 state deduction in France).",CITROEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""AMI"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""short, narrow, tall"",  ""overall-design"": [""compact"", ""urban-friendly"", ""minimalist""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""short"", ""suicide-style""],    ""roof"": [""flat""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CITROEN C-Elysee,"The 2013 Citroen C-Elysee comes as the model's second generation, continuing the car's ten-year legacy. The new model extends an established compact car sold on the international market in large quantities. From the previous generation, the gasoline engine lineup is completed by including the new VTi 115 engine, which can be paired with either a manual or automatic gearbox. The Citroen C-Elysee offers the HDi 92 as well, a well-established diesel engine with over six million units produced. This engine combines the advantages of a road car, such as high torque at low engine speeds, with impressive fuel efficiency. Also, the vehicle comes equipped with the new VTi 72 gasoline engine, which has been specifically designed to meet the driving conditions and fuel requirements of international markets. It focuses on optimizing performance and achieving better fuel economy than the 1.4-liter engine it replaces. The vehicle's design is based on the three main compartments, as they are clearly separated but at the same time integrated into the body as a whole. The rounded wings give the car a wider stance highlighting the spacious interior. Even if it is redesigned, the front grille clearly integrates the model into the brand's family, making the distinctive logo look like it stretches between the headlights. The car comes in seven different colors and can optionally have chrome insertions. For a better adaptation to the conditions in the countries where it is sold, the 2013 C-Elysee has some structural upgrades. It's being built to have appropriate ground clearance and is equipped with the right tires while having certain body parts reinforced to ensure a proper driving experience. For improved safety, the car can also have improved under-body protection. The interior of the car is based on efficiency and practicability. The materials used are chosen to be attractive but also easy to care for, bearing in mind the vehicle's robust design. When discussing the interior dimensions, the primary focus lies on the generous legroom it provides. Among its class, the back seats stand out for offering exceptionally comfortable space. Despite the increased interior size, the cargo space remains unaffected, as the trunk ranks among the largest in the compact segment of the vehicle. The technological advance sees the vehicle come equipped as standard in some countries with features like a digital display, rear parking sensors, and a cruise control function. There are optional features that enhance the comfort and accessibility of the Citroën, such as a touch-screen GPS and a reversing camera. Depending on the country's climate where it is sold, additional features like a heated windshield and upgraded air conditioning can be equipped to provide a tailored driving experience and further increase the global popularity of the model.",CITROEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Citroen C-Elysee"",  ""year"": ""2013"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""compact"", ""spacious"", ""efficient"", ""practical"", ""attractive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""heated""],    ""grille"": [""front"", ""integrated"", ""distinctive""],    ""hood"": [""rounded""],    ""headlights"": [""integrated""],    ""bumper"": [""reinforced""],    ""wheel"": [""appropriate"", ""right""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CITROEN DS4,"Citroen pushed harder on the premium segment with the introduction of the second model in the DS lineup, and it was not just a badge-engineered product. The French carmaker made the second step towards launching the DS as a brand after it unveiled the DS4 under the Citroen badge. Even though it shared its underpinnings with the Citroen C4, it was a different vehicle. While the C4 was just a mundane, family vehicle, the DS4 featured a more complex design, made to create a premium appearance. Thus, at the front, the swept-back headlights lost the boomerang styling. The grille was extended downwards into the apron with a black mesh grille and a horizontal slat for the license plate. It was flanked by two clusters where the carmaker installed the foglamps and the daytime running lights fitted with LEDs. The coupe profile was accentuated by the hidden rear door handles, concealed in the C-pillars. Last but not least, the sculptured line that started on the front fenders was elegantly connected to the rear ones, emphasizing the muscular look of the vehicle. Inside, the carmaker focused on high-quality materials and technology to attract customers. Thus, the instrument cluster featured three dials where the analog gauges and TFT displays were neatly mixed. The high-bolstered front seats created the image of a sporty vehicle, while the seats' pattern was enhanced with extra padding areas for the back and the spinal. The rear split-folding bench could accommodate up to three passengers, although there was limited headroom and legroom for the middle occupant. Under the hood, Citroen installed turbocharged engines, either gasoline or diesel. In order to save fuel, the carmaker added start-stop technology for selected versions.",CITROEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""DS4"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""swept-back"", ""complex"", ""sculptured"", ""muscular""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""swept-back""],    ""grille"": [""extended"", ""black mesh"", ""horizontal slat""],    ""hood"": [""sculptured""],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""hidden rear door handles"", ""concealed C-pillars""],    ""roof"": [""coupe profile""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CITROEN C5 Aircross,"With a rising demand for SUVs and crossovers, Citroen had to find a solution and offer one on the market before being pushed away by competition, and the result was the C5 Aircross. While it wasn't the first crossover built by Citroen, it was one of the most important for it. Not only that, it was the largest in its family. It also shared its platform with the Peugeot 3008 and a utility vehicle. Due to that, it was initially offered exclusively with a front-wheel drive system, and only after a hybrid version came on the market was it available with an all-wheel drive. The car's exterior showed a different appearance than the rest of Citroen's range. The front fascia featured a horizontal slat that made a clear distinction between the daytime running lights and the headlights. In the middle, the ""double-chevron"" badge was tall, taking a bit from the hood's lower edge. With its raised greenhouse that resembled an SUV, the C5 Aircross tried to impress customers. Inside, the automaker created a roomy cabin with enough room for five adults. Since there was no transmission toward the rear axle, the floor was flat enough to provide room for three occupants in the back. At the front, the two bucket seats were separated by a tall center console. Citroen installed an 8"" touchscreen atop the center stack for the infotainment unit, while the driver benefited from a wide 12.3"" TFT for the instrument panel. Under the hood, the French automaker installed a choice of turbocharged gasoline and diesel engines. A hybrid version was introduced later on and finally provided an all-wheel drive system.",CITROEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""C5 Aircross"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""largest in its family"",  ""overall-design"": [""different appearance"", ""raised greenhouse"", ""roomy cabin""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""horizontal slat""],    ""hood"": [""tall double-chevron badge""],    ""headlights"": [""distinct from daytime running lights""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""room for five adults"", ""flat floor at the back""],    ""roof"": [""resembles an SUV""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CITROEN C-Zero,"The 3.47 m long city car was the Citroen’s first electric car, with zero CO2 emissions and zero noise. The C-Zero shared the same base as the Peugeot iOn and Mitsubishi i-MiEV siblings. The engine was powered by a Lithium-ion located in the center of the vehicle. The theoretic range was of 150 km, while Citroen communicated a real autonomy between 100 and 120 km. Recharging the C-Zero’s battery was easy by connecting the power cord to a 220V outlet, taking around 11 hours for a full charge. A fast charging station would reduce the charing time considerably, taking only 30 minutes for an 80%. The interior space was good in the front and decent in the back. The load area, however, was at a 166-liter capacity, more like an enlarged glovebox. If necessary, the rear seats could be folded to increase the trunk space at 860 liters. Being designed as a city car, the C-Zero had a smooth steering and was easy to drive around town. The C-Zero’s interior was clean, with intuitive simple controls. An LCD display gave information regarding the battery’s stats. The C-Zero was equipped with air conditioning, radio remote control, electric windows, ESP and 6 airbags. The C-Zero's price was around $36.000.",CITROEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""C-Zero"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""3.47 m long"",  ""overall-design"": [""electric"", ""compact"", ""city-friendly"", ""clean"", ""intuitive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CITROEN C5 Crosstourer,"With the rising interest in the crossover market, Citroen tried to offer a big station wagon in the segment, adding the special version CrossTourer to its already known C5 station wagon model. There has been a long way since the first generation of the Citroen Hydractive suspension on the famous DS. It constantly evolved and it was installed on various models. The C5 was the second-largest vehicle in the French constructor lineup, after the C6 limousine and it was the base platform to develop the C5 CrossTourer. A car that could fit well on a city street and on the fields as well. The medium-sized station wagon version of the Citroen C5 was upgraded in 2014 to a crossover vehicle. To enhance it as an all-road vehicle, the outside design was upgraded with new plastic protections on the wheel-arches. Long chromed strips were installed on the bottom of the doors, along the side sills. More chrome was found on the side mirrors. The Hydractive III+ suspension system allowed a 15 mm (0.6”) increase in the ground clearance. Two lengthwise mate gray roof rails were installed on the roof. To complete the exterior look, the car was fitted with 18” alloy-wheels in mate gray. The interior was unchanged from the normal C5 Tourer, but it wasn't available in the base trim anymore. The C5 CrossTourer was available with almost all the engine lineup from the regular C5 Tourer. It wasn't compatible with the base engines of 1.6-liter HDI 115 hp.",CITROEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""C5 CrossTourer"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": ""medium-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""crossover"", ""all-road"", ""elegant""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""18-inch alloy"", ""mate gray""],    ""doors"": [""long chromed strips""],    ""roof"": [""mate gray roof rails""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CUPRA Ateca,"CUPRA became SEAT's sports-oriented sub-brand, and the Ateca was its first product with specific badges on it. The Ateca name, though, came from its non-sporty sibling. SEAT was Volkswagen's Spanish brand, and these vehicles shared their underpinnings. As a result, Cupra had the same parts as its German sibling but tuned for a sportier ride. The Ateca, for instance, was built on the same MQB A-1 platform used by the Jetta or the Tiguan. Still, there was a different approach for the Spanish sporty compact crossover/SUV. One of the most significant differences between the CUPRA and the SEAT was the design. While both vehicles had similar body panels, their bumpers were different. As a result, the CUPRA Ateca had a broad trapezoidal-shaped grille on the air dam adorned with a hexagon-shaped mesh grille. In addition, the automaker installed a pair of side scoops that were actually fake. From its profile, it was clearly a SEAT Ateca, and that included the wider wheel fenders and the side sills. Still, it had an elegant yet sporty look, mostly thanks to the lower ground clearance than on the regular Ateca or the Tiguan. At the back, on the other hand, it had four exhausts, and its non-sporty sibling couldn't afford that. To further emphasize the brand's name, the unusual-looking badge of the vehicle was complemented on the tailgate by the brand name. Inside, it was roomy enough to carry five adult-sized passengers. At the front, CUPRA installed high-bolstered seats, which was unusual for an SUV. Still, this version of the Ateca was not exactly the mundane vehicle good for school runs and weekly shopping, even though it could successfully do that. But the dashboard was too bland for a sporty vehicle. It was covered with the same budget-friendly materials as the regular Ateca. Inside the instrument cluster, the automaker put a 10” digital display that could show the dials and information from the navigation system. On the center stack, the car manufacturer installed a touchscreen for the infotainment system, while the center console housed the gear selector for the automatic transmission and six buttons for driving programs. Last but not least, the driver was spoiled with a set of aluminum pedals. In the back, the split-folding bench seat could accommodate three people, and it could also expand the trunk when it was folded down. But the most significant difference from the SEAT Ateca was under the hood, where the automaker got a punchy two-liter turbocharged gasoline engine, which was also available on Tiguan R. It was mated to a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox that sent the power in all corners. Thanks to the stiffened suspension, the lower ground clearance, and the wider tires, the CUPRA Ateca was mostly an alternative to hot hatches rather than a sporty SUV.",CUPRA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""CUPRA Ateca"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""compact crossover/SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""elegant"", ""sporty"", ""roomy""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""trapezoidal-shaped"", ""hexagon-shaped mesh""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""different from SEAT Ateca""],    ""wheel"": [""wider wheel fenders""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""four exhausts""],    ""interior"": [""high-bolstered seats"", ""10” digital display"", ""touchscreen for infotainment"", ""aluminum pedals""]  }}```"
CUPRA Leon Sportstourer,"The Cupra is the Spanish brand that evolved from the sporty version of SEAT cars into a different brand of sport vehicles. Something like AMG from Mercedes-Benz, but with less power and cheaper. A lot cheaper. The Leon Cupra is available in two body versions: hatchback and station-wagon, the later being called Sportstourer. The lineup is fed-up with a lot of options. The LED headlights are fitted as standard. Inside, the cabin is lighted only with LED's. Spor bucket seats are also standard. For the infotainment unit, a state-of-the-art system with a 10” Retina display is installed on the dashboard. It offers an wireless connection with Apple CarPlay and supports connectivity for Android Auto. The best part is for the performance area where engines are starting from 245 hp with a plug-in hybrid system. The next in line is a 2.0-liter gasoline turbocharged with 300 hp. Both variants are FWD and with a limited slip differential. Top of the line is the 310 hp powerplant. It is available only for the Sportstourer (station-wagon) variant and is offered with all-wheel-drive system. The performances were not published, but over 155 mph speed will be achieved easily and a 0-100 kph (62 mph) under 6 seconds are expected.

CUPRA Born,"Volkswagen group worked hard to develop a platform for electric vehicles named MEB. The Cupra Born wants to be the sportier version for that model in the Spanish brand lineup. The German carmaker went through hard times during the Dieselgate emission scandal. Soon, its management understood that even if the diesel engine didn't die, the car-maker had to come with a new electric vehicle, either as a super-mini such as the Seat MII or Volkswagen up! Cupra was the sportier brand that evolved from SEAT. The designers took their inspiration from the SUV-coupe trend, which was spread worldwide with the introduction of the BMW X6 in 2008. Cupra was born as the sportier version for Spanish carmaker vehicles, but it evolved into a distinct brand that offered a few models which were different than the ones sold under the SEAT brand, and the same went with the Born model. The front part of the car featured a short hood with no grille above the bumper since the car was electric. A grille was installed on the lower apron to cool the batteries and the motors. In the rear, the raked tailgate followed the same design cues as the Volkswagen iD4, built on the same platform. Cupra installed a simple dashboard in a minimalist style concept. The standard 12"" infotainment unit was placed over the center stack. Another TFT screen was used as an instrument cluster. Its cabin offered room for five, with real room for three passengers in the back thanks to its flat floor. At the launch, SEAT offered a choice of three electric motors ranged between 150 hp and 231 hp. The carmaker provided three battery packs ranged between 45 kWh and 77 kWh, which allowed the vehicle a range of up to 540 km (335 miles).",CUPRA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Cupra Born"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""super-mini"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""electric"", ""SUV-coupe inspired"", ""minimalist"", ""distinct""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""short""],    ""grille"": [""lower"", ""functional""],    ""hood"": [""short""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""electric""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""raked""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CUPRA Leon,"The Leon Cupra reached its 4th generation in 2020, coming with two available body styles: a 5-door and a Sportstourer. The new model came with new horizontal headlamps offering a different design from the previous one, which were wider and positioned in a different angle. The front bumper was redesigned to give the car a more aggressive look. It was a muscular, strong bumper with vertical gray cosmetic elements that were not for design purposes only and had also a practical aerodynamic effect by channeling the air towards the sides. The stability was improved due to the longer wheelbase, however, that also came with compromising a bit of the car’s agility. The car was longer by 9cm than the previous model. New 19-inch wheels were added, with the alloys having a special design including the copper accents already known to the public that come with the Cupra. The exterior design was refined with sharp lines that started from the front and faded towards the rear. The rear of the new Cupra brought a three-dimensional sculptural back with a horizontal leg light strip that animated differently depending on the action taken. For example, when locking the car, the light would cascade from one side to the other. For 2020, Cupra also brought the electrified version, a plug-in hybrid engine developing 245 hp. Safety wise, the car was equipped with the most advanced systems to protect the driver and passengers from unwanted incidents.",CUPRA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Leon Cupra"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""longer by 9cm"",  ""overall-design"": [""muscular"", ""aggressive"", ""refined"", ""sharp"", ""three-dimensional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""horizontal"", ""wider"", ""different angle""],    ""bumper"": [""muscular"", ""strong"", ""aggressive"", ""vertical gray cosmetic elements"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""wheel"": [""19-inch"", ""special design"", ""copper accents""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
CUPRA Formentor,"Performance. Technology. Power. Hybrid. In 2019, the first standalone Cupra won our hearts with the Ateca. This year, the Spanish brand brought its first bespoke model, the Cupra Formentor. Not very different from the concept that previewed it, the coupe crossover was unveiled during the ill-fated Geneva Motor Show in early March. Sporty design, strong lines and fine details, but with all terrain attributes included. 4 Soft metallic paints, 3 special paints and 2 matte options. Quite a variety of choices to perfectly complement Cupra's design. The interior is equipped with high quality materials and combines both modernity and sportiness. On the dashboard, we have a 12 inch touchscreen infotainment system, 2 inches wider than the touchscreen available in the Cupra Leon. It can be controlled by both voice and gestures and is one of the most advanced infotainment systems. If you're thinking of buying the ultramodern SUV coupe, you have a choice of two engines. There's the hybrid version and front-wheel-drive, which comes in a 1.4L gasoline engine and an electric one to produce 245HP. For a sportier experience, a nice choice is the 4WD with 310HP.

CUPRA Tavascan,"Introduced in the spring of 2023, the Tavascan joined Cupra's EV lineup built on top of Volkswagen's MEB platform, competing in the European compact-sized crossover segment. Cupra evolved from being a trim level for a few SEAT vehicles into a separate brand that became a sporty spin-off brand. Moreover, it started to create specific models with a completely different look than its Spanish brother, even though both marques were part of the Volkswagen Group. Thus, it was challenging to say that the Tavascan was a badge-engineered product, even though it was based on the same platform as the Volkswagen ID.4. The Tavascan featured a very aggressive look for the front fascia, where a pair of triangular headlights were fitted with triangular lamps. A broad black trim replaced the main grille, while the apron featured a center cooling area with horizontal slats and side scoops that helped the airflow go around the bodywork, improving the aerodynamic factor. From its side, the ascending beltline and the sloped-down roofline towards the back of the vehicle created a coupe look for the Spanish crossover. Inside, the sporty bucket front seats were fitted as standard and were available with a choice of three colors. On the dashboard, Cupra installed in the Tavascan an instrument panel similar to the one placed on the Born and the Volkswagen's ID.3. It also featured a second 15” touchscreen atop the center stack that was fitted with a new HMI (Human Machine Interface) infotainment system. In the back, there was room for up to three passengers on the split-folding benchseat. Cupra, a name that came from Cup and Racing, offered the Tavascan with a choice of two motors: one for the RWD version and the other for the AWD version.",CUPRA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Tavascan"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact-sized crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""sporty"", ""coupe look"", ""aerodynamic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""triangular"", ""black trim"", ""horizontal slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""triangular""],    ""bumper"": [""center cooling area"", ""side scoops""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloped-down""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DACIA JOGGER,"The Romanian brand made an MPV that looked more like an extended station wagon, but it could carry up to seven people inside. Renault bought the Dacia brand from Romania to transform it into a budget-friendly marque. This strategy worked excellently during the world financial crisis from 2008 – 2010. After that, customers started to ask for more features on this affordable automaker. Models such as the Duster small-sized SUV and Sandero Stepway crossover debuted on the market. And they didn't look that cheap anymore, even though they were. In 2022, Dacia dared and introduced the Jogger as a replacement for the former, unsuccessful Lodgy as a seven-seat vehicle. The car's design didn't look like it was made in a hurry. It sported a front fascia with a broad grille adorned with silver trims and the DC badge that took center stage. The headlights were enhanced with LED daytime running lights but no LED headlamps. On the lower side of the front bumper, Dacia installed a trapezoidal-shaped grille flanked by side scoops that hosted the fog lamps, which were offered as an option. The car's profile revealed an ascending beltline and flared wheel arches on both axles. Even though it was just a front-wheel-driven vehicle. Inside, the automaker installed better materials than on this car's predecessor, with fewer hard-plastic areas and better upholstery. The dashboard sported analog dials depending on the version, but a TFT display was also available. Atop the center stack, the automaker placed a small-sized touch-screen for the infotainment system, but that was just an option. Base models came fitted with just a stereo. But the car's most important advantage on the market was its seven-seat ability. Even though the room on the rearmost seats was not great, it was enough for small jaunts.",DACIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Jogger"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""small-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""budget-friendly"", ""modern"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""adorned"", ""silver-trimmed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""enhanced"", ""LED daytime running lights""],    ""bumper"": [""trapezoidal-shaped"", ""flanked by side scoops""],    ""wheel"": [""flared wheel arches""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DACIA Duster,"Dacia unveiled the refreshed version of its SUV model Duster in the summer of 2021, and apart from the visual updates, it brought some technological improvements. Dacia was part of the Renault Group since 1999, and the French carmaker worked hard to make the unknown brand a European contender in the budget-car market. After the Logan sedan, the next best thing was the Duster, which it launched in 2010. Fast forward to 2017, and the Romanian SUV evolved into a second generation that shared most of its underpinnings with its predecessor, and four years later, it received a mid-life cycle impulse. The car's exterior received an improved front fascia with the new Y-shaped signature daytime running lights introduced on the third generation of the Logan. The turn signals and the low-beam headlights featured LED lights as well. At the back, the redesigned rear spoiler slightly improved the fuel efficiency. Both front and rear plastic trims that mimicked an underbody shield sported a satin-chromed finish. At the back, the carmaker added new taillights, which also wore the Y-shaped signature lights. Inside, the SUV featured a new infotainment system with an up to 8"" touch-screen mounted on the center stack above the climate-control dials. Another improvement was for the center armrest, which was no longer attached to the driver's seat as before. Dacia also installed new headrests on the 2021 Duster. Under the refreshed bodywork, it was the same platform used for the first Duster generation. The engine lineup lost the base, 95 hp turbo-diesel unit and retained only the 115 hp version. There were also four gasoline versions, starting with an inline-three turbocharged unit good for 90 horses, while the most potent version remained the 1.33-liter powerplant that provided 130 hp.",DACIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Duster"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""improved"", ""redesigned"", ""satin-chromed"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""improved"", ""redesigned""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""Y-shaped"", ""low-beam""],    ""bumper"": [""plastic"", ""satin-chromed""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""redesigned"", ""improved""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DACIA Sandero Stepway,"The Sandero was the best selling model of the Romanian car-maker Dacia, with over 2.1 million units sold in just three years, and the Stepway version was responsible for 65% of those sells. Dacia unveiled the second generation of the Sandero Stepway in 2020. The hatch-back version of the Logan was a European hit due to its small-class exterior size, compact-size interior room and budget price. That recipe was important and just a few customers cared that the car was fitted with old Renault parts. The car worked and the reliability index was high. Dacia designed the Sandero Stepway as a true, budget alternative for other small crossovers. Even if it shared some parts with the regular Sandero, that trim-level showed a few styling differences. The front side featured a gray plastic shield under the bumper. From the sides, the black moldings around the wheel-arches enhanced the crossover look. The roof-rails featured a clever system that allowed them to be installed both longitudinally and transversely. A gray plastic shield enhanced the look for the rear bumper. Inside, the Sandero Stepway featured orange lines on the vents. The lettering “Stepway” was embroiled on the front seatbacks. For the instrument cluster, the designers didn't struggle too much and took the same panel designed for the Duster, the 4x4 SUV from Dacia. For the rear passengers, a split-fold bench made its appearance for the first time in the Sandero Stepway range. At the time of its launch, the Sandero Stepway was available with a choice of three engines. The base version featured a 1-liter, three-cylinder unit. A turbocharged 1-liter unit powered the mid-level, and the top version was the 1.0-liter bi-fuel (gasoline-LPG) engine that developed 100 hp.",DACIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Sandero Stepway"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""small-class exterior, compact-size interior"",  ""overall-design"": [""budget alternative for small crossovers"", ""styling differences from regular Sandero""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""gray plastic shield"", ""black moldings"", ""orange lines on vents""],    ""wheel"": [""black moldings around wheel-arches""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""clever roof-rails system""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DACIA Sandero,"The second generation of the Dacia Sandero was unveiled in 2020 in an offline event along with the Logan and the Sandero Stepway. The Romanian car-maker Dacia was part of the Renault Group before the Renault-Nissan alliance was formed. Introduced in 2007, Sandero's first generation accounted for more than 2.1 million units sold for the Dacia brand. Dacia designed the Sandero as a small-class vehicle for urban environments. Its styling was different than the Logan, but it was built on the same platform. The Y-shaped LED daytime running lights and the wider fenders made the car looks more prominent than it was. A hexagonal, 3D mesh grille design was installed to amplify the car's width. A lower A-shaped grille with the radar system enclosed completed the front fascia. In the back, the car looked rather dull without any significant element to show. A premiere for the Sandero introduced the factory sunroof; an option never met before for the Romanian brand. The interior design team worked hard and brought smart solutions for the customers. On top of the dashboard, smartphone support with a lid on top of the dashboard plus a USB connection transformed the driver's personal mobile phone into a media control unit. The top of the range version featured a Media Nav system with wireless integration for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Due to the longer wheelbase than its predecessor, the Sandero offered more legroom for the rear passengers. At the time of its launch, the Sandero was available with a choice of three engines. The base version featured a 1-liter, three-cylinder unit.

DACIA Logan,"The Romanian brand Dacia unveiled the third generation of the Logan range at the end of September 2020. It was a complete makeover of the low-budget car. The Romanian car-company Dacia was part of the Renault Group when it introduced the Logan lineup's first generation. That car was built mainly for the Romanians and East Europeans with a base price lower than a set of light-alloy wheels from Rolls-Royce. Its exterior design was not a concern for the customers. The second generation started to look better, but the 2020 model brought more appeal to it. A completely new design, with bold headlights that incorporated the LED daytime running lights, a hexagonal 3D grille, and an A-shaped lower grille in the apron, made the car look aggressive. The wheel-arches were wider than the rest of the bodywork, and the sculptured door panels looked better than before when they were just slightly curved. Due to the sloped rear windscreen and the higher trunk area, it seemed like the greenhouse was shorter. The interior design team worked hard and brought smart solutions for the customers. On top of the dashboard, smartphone support with a lid on top of the dashboard plus a USB connection transformed the driver's personal mobile phone into a media control unit.

DACIA Logan MCV,"The Dacia Logan is a more family oriented vehicle produced by the French producer Renault in collaboration with the Romanian subsidiary Dacia. The first generation of Logan was released back in 2004 and the new 2016 model was part of the 2nd generation, only a facelifted version of it. The Logan was mostly known as a basic, reliable and durable car. It was designed to take people from A to B. The Logan was available in a sedan, MCV or a van body shape, to suit all needs. It was mostly bought by people with a low-budget, for employees or as taxi cars. In 2016, Dacia presented their first automatic transmission called Easy-R. Design wise, the new Logan sedan had a refreshed interior and exterior, making it more attractive to the buyers. The changes include a redesigned headlamps and taillights, as well as the LED daytime running lights had a “pattern of four stacked rectangles”, as Dacia says. Both the front and the rear bumper were redesigned to give the impression of a more muscular look. The interior of the Logan was very roomy, with a good driving position, comfortable seats and intuitive simple controls. Even if the plastics used for the dashboard and door trims were hard plastics, the overall design looked fresh. Unexpectedly, the trunk space was enormous. So if you’re thinking to take half of your house with you, you might as well do it. The load area had a capacity of 510 L. The basic Logan designed to be a people’s car was a little bit over $13,000 with most of the optionals included.",DACIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Dacia Logan"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""basic"", ""reliable"", ""durable"", ""refreshed"", ""attractive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""redesigned"", ""LED"", ""rectangular pattern""],    ""bumper"": [""redesigned"", ""muscular""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DACIA Duster Pick-Up,"Dacia officially returned to the pickup market with a version based on the successful model Duster. Even though it wasn't that big, it was a sign that it will increase its interest into the LCV segment. The Romanian carmaker built a family of pickup vehicles, with single or double cabs configurations before Renault bought it. It also had a 4x4 pickup in its lineup, but all of those were gone after the French company purchased it. Later on, they offered a Logan with a bed in the back. For the first generation of the Duster, a custom builder transformed 500 units as pickup. But in 2020, Dacia introduced its own version, based on the second generation of the small SUV. The Duster pickup featured the same front design as the Duster family, but with a black lower bumper. After the short cabin with a thick B-pillar, the engineers installed a bed with a rear tailgate. The taillights were carried-over from the rest of the SUV range. The black plastic trim made the connection between the flared wheel arches and the door panel on the front fenders. For the interior, Dacia offered two regular seats from the rest of the range and an identical dashboard. Inside the instrument cluster, the designers placed the same analog dials and a small LCD for the on-board computer. The Duster Pickup was offered with a single engine-transmission setup, a 1.5-liter turbodiesel paired to a 6-speed manual that sent the power to all corners.",DACIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Duster Pickup"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""compact"", ""utilitarian"", ""rugged""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black lower bumper""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""rear tailgate""],    ""wheel"": [""flared wheel arches""],    ""doors"": [""short cabin"", ""thick B-pillar""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""4x4 pickup setup""],  }}```"
DACIA Dokker Van,"Considered one of the most practical vehicles in its class, the Dacia Dokker Van released in 2012 was an instant hit. The nameplate of “Dokker” came from two combined words, dock and worker. The name emphasised the vehicle’s high carrying capacity and its modularity offered with the passenger version. With 4.36m in length, 1.75m in width and 1.81m in height, the practical van offered an enormous 3300 liters cargo area and a maximum of 1.9m load length. To enhance practicality, the back of the front passenger seat could be tipped forward. If necessary, the whole seat could be tipped forward to ensure longer items could be carried, up to 2.42m. When removed, the front passenger seat extended the load area to 3900 liters. To ensure easy access, the Dokker Van was fitted with a wide sliding door. The upper trim levels could be fitted with an optional second door. At the rear, the Dokker featured a split tailgate, with a wider door on the driver’s side and a narrower one of the passenger’s side. The doors would open at 90 degrees while kept in place by a retention system that prevented them from slamming. However, if needed, using a handle located on the inside of the door, the user could unlock the doors to be open at 180 degrees.",DACIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Dacia Dokker Van"",  ""year"": ""2012"",  ""size"": ""4.36m length, 1.75m width, 1.81m height"",  ""overall-design"": [""practical"", ""modular"", ""spacious"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""wide sliding"", ""split tailgate"", ""retention system"", ""optional second door""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DACIA Logan MCV Stepway,"The Romanian car-maker Dacia had a big success with its range of crossovers, named Stepway. It was introduced on the small hatchback Sandero and it evolved across its entire range. Even for sedans. The second generation of the Dacia Logan MCV was shrunk when compared to its predecessor. While the first generation was available with up to 7 seats, the second version was, basically, a station-wagon version for the Dacia Logan sedan. Strangely, the station-wagon received the MCV name, which meant Multi Convivial Vehicle. The MCV Stepway featured a higher ground clearance than the regular MCV. It was meant to be used on unpaved roads. The black plastic overfenders mimicked the styling of an SUV, even though the car was just a station-wagon. The Stepway was the ultimate trim level for the MCV and it was fitted as standard with a new MediaNav infotainment system, parking sensors, and Hill Start Assist. Man-made leather upholstery was on the options list. Strangely, the car-maker announced that the horn was placed on the steering wheel. The car featured seating for three in the back and, due to its longer roofline, it offered good headroom. The legroom was limited due to its moderate wheelbase. Under the hood, the MCV Stepway was offered with a choice of diesel and gasoline engine mated as standard to a 5-speed manual. An option for a robotized (Single-clutch) gearbox was available for specific engines.",DACIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Dacia Logan MCV Stepway"",  ""year"": ""second generation"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""compact"", ""rugged"", ""station-wagon"", ""functional"", ""practical""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""shrunk"", ""functional""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""higher ground clearance""],    ""doors"": [""station-wagon"", ""man-made leather upholstery""],    ""roof"": [""longer roofline"", ""good headroom""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DACIA Lodgy,"The Romanian company Dacia made a big step forward with the introduction of the Lodgy. The Lodgy was a 7-passenger monovolume that was built in Tanger, Maroc. Dacia used to produce cars for people on a tight budget, however, the car were extremely reliable and durable, even if equipped with fewer options and less quality materials. The Lodgy came with different engine options: a 1.2-liter, a 1.5-liter, one producing 110 hp and the other one 90 hp, and a 1.6-liter gasoline producing 85 hp. With the 1.2-liter engine, the Lodgy would take 10.6 seconds to reach 100 km/h. Compared to the family car, the Logan MCV, the Lodgy’s length was increased by 1.06 inches, however, the interior space was better used. The trunk size was great, offering 207 liters with the 7-seats configuration, 634 liters with the 3rd row folded and up to 2.600 liters with the 2nd and the 3rd row seats removed. Inside the cabin, the controls were intuitively placed and the overall dashboard gave an airy feeling. The quality of the materials used was increased. The cabin was quieter by up to 30% compared to Dacia’s previous models, meaning that the engine and the tire roll sound was reduced inside. The Logdy was the first Dacia to feature a modern infotainment system called the Media Nav. The system was produced by LG and came with a 7-inch touchscreen display that was very responsive. Additionally, the Lodgy came with an USB and an AUX port.",DACIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Lodgy"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""7-passenger monovolume"",  ""overall-design"": [""reliable"", ""durable"", ""spacious"", ""intuitive"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DACIA Spring,"The Dacia Spring electric version was released in 2020 and was the smallest car Dacia ever made. The small Spring had room for 4 people only and was designed for urban traffic, thus the load area was a decent 300L. The exterior design of the Spring was pretty much the Renault Kwid’s, with narrow headlamps, a big grille with chrome accents and the Dacia logo. From the back, the Spring was similar to the Dacia’s Sandero released in the same year, with a redesigned rear bumper. The Spring had an electric engine that developed 45 hp paired with a 26.8 kW battery. The autonomy was estimated at around 220 km and possibly 295 km in urban traffic with constant speed and weather conditions close to ideal. The battery could be charged at 220V. Inside the Spring we could find a simple, well-put together cabin, the interior design not being very different from the Sandero’s older versions. The users could connect their mobile devices through either Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, using the Dacia’s media-nav system, however, it was not a standard option. Dacia also released a mobile application called “My Dacia”, through which users could see the battery percentage left, the car’s location, the ETA for charging and could turn on the climate control. The small vehicle had a warranty of 3 years or 100.000 km and Dacia also provided customers with an 8 year warranty for the battery. The Dacia Spring was expected to be a hit as it was a budget car that offered great advantages.",DACIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Dacia Spring"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""smallest"",  ""overall-design"": [""small"", ""urban"", ""electric"", ""simple"", ""budget""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""narrow""],    ""grille"": [""big"", ""chrome""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""narrow""],    ""bumper"": [""redesigned""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DAIHATSU Sirion,"Daihatsu designed the 2004 Sirion for the European market, and six years later, it came with a refreshed version that should increase its sales. Toyota held a major part of Daihatsu's stakes since 1998, and it helped the small carmaker to make better vehicles, fit for other markets than Japan's. The Sirion was part of the company's program to expand in Europe with small-sized vehicles that were more affordable than the Yaris. The 2004 Sirion, with its strange design, started to get traction on the market until 2007 when it managed to sell almost 60.000 units. But then, due to the world financial crisis, the sales dropped. The facelifted Sirion should save the company from its continuous decline in sales. Small-sized, with slightly curved body panels and flared wheel-arches, the Sirion tried to look sportier than its engine or chassis could handle. Daihatsu changed its headlights with clear-lens ones. Its bumper looked like it was ready to tackle a race track or, due to its round fog-lights mounted on the outer sides, a rally stage. It even featured a roof-spoiler on the top of its vertical tailgate. Inside, Daihatsu's designers made an oval instrument cluster with an unusual dial display, where the tachometer took the left side, and the speedometer described an arched line over a center-mounted LCD. Each door-card carried a cup-holder, which was also unusual for European customers. The seats were tall to make more legroom. The rear passengers could have slid their feet under the front seats. Under the hood, the Sirion received a 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine from Toyota. It was the only option they could get and comply with the European emission regulations, and only with a manual transmission.",DAIHATSU,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Sirion"",  ""year"": ""2004"",  ""size"": ""Small-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""Sporty"", ""Affordable"", ""Curved"", ""Facelifted"", ""Compact""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""Slightly curved""],    ""headlights"": [""Clear-lens""],    ""bumper"": [""Ready for race track"", ""Round fog-lights""],    ""wheel"": [""Flared wheel-arches""],    ""doors"": [""Tall seats"", ""Cup-holder""],    ""roof"": [""Roof-spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""Vertical tailgate""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DAIHATSU Ayla,"Introduced at the 2012 Indonesia International Motor Show, the Ayla was a great example of a small car built by a giant carmaker. Toyota owned a big chunk of the Daihatsu carmaker and helped it to develop the Ayla for emerging markets. The result was a small-sized vehicle fit for rough roads. On the other hand, Daihatsu was already known in Japan for its small-sized vehicles that could fit in narrow streets and provided a great fuel-efficiency. In Europe, Daihatsu tried its luck with several pocket-size off-road vehicles, but its success was limited. Maybe it should try the Ayla as well, but it kept it for other markets. The Ayla's egg shape was interrupted by a few angular lines on the headlights and the aggressive bumper design. On its sides, the ascending line followed a hot-hatch sporty profile, ended with a roof-spoiler mounted on top of the liftgate. Its high-mounted taillights were protected for small bumps in the parking lot or by shopping carts in the rear. Inside, it was surprisingly roomy for its size, thanks to the high seating position and the tall greenhouse. Despite being a small, budget vehicle, it offered adequate comfort features and a sound system with a USB port and a CD-player. The instrument cluster was dominated by a huge speedometer that took center stage and a smaller tachometer on its left side. An LCD took the right side and showed info for the on-board computer.

DAIHATSU Cuore,"Daihatsu targeted mostly the customers who needed a cheap, reliable car that could take them from A to B without stress and with an impressive fuel-efficiency. Daihatsu was a big carmaker and shared a few parts or models either with Toyota or Subaru. The Cuore (heart in Italian) lineup was established in 1980, and by 2007 it already reached its seventh generation. From the design point of view, it is hard to understand why such a good car received such bad treatment from the design department. Even if it looked better than its predecessor, it looked average for the European's taste. The bumper was tall, and the small cuts in the upper and lower side for the grille didn't make such a good impression. With its short front side and tall stance, it looked closer to a kei-car vehicle than to a supermini European vehicle. Despite its short length, the Cuore featured four doors. In the back, next to the tailgate, Daihatsu installed vertical taillights to be protected in the parking lot. The interior was simple, with a grey dashboard from top to bottom and from left to right. On the center stack, at the bottom, there were the three rotary knobs for the HVAC unit. A stereo-CD with AM/FM occupied the upper side of the center stack. Despite the intelligent layout, the materials used looked cheap but reliable. Due to the high seating position, the Cuore offered good legroom even for the rear seat passengers. There was a trick with the bench, which could slide back and forth to improve the rear knee room or to increase the luggage compartment. Daihatsu offered only one engine option for the Cuore. It was the three cylinders unit. It was good for 150 kph (93 mph).",DAIHATSU,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Cuore"",  ""year"": ""2007"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""average"", ""tall"", ""short"", ""simple"", ""reliable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""small cuts"", ""tall""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""tall""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""four""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DATSUN GO,"In 2013, Nissan revived its Datsun nameplate as a budget-brand, and its first product was the GO, which was facelifted in 2018. On some markets, customers just wanted a simple vehicle to climb inside and go, and one of the major purchasing decisions is the price. Nissan made the GO for those customers and badged it as a Datsun. While the original model was stripped from most safety systems, it didn't even feature an ABS. The refreshed version returned with more than that. Just by looking at the car, some would recognize the car's overall shape, and it wouldn't be wrong. It was built on the same platform as the 2010 Nissan Micra (K13). The carmaker did more than just trade the Nissan badge with a Datsun and changed most of the body panels. At the front, the car featured angular-shaped headlights, swept-back toward the A-pillars. A big hexagonal grille with a chromed surrounding made the car's front more visible. The bumper featured daytime running lights on the side scoops, while the reversed trapezoidal grille tried to make the car look sportier. In the back, the taillights featured an angular design as well. Most importantly, Nissan introduced a rear windscreen wiper. Inside, the 2018 Datsun GO featured a sculptured-shaped dash-panel with a v-shaped theme for the frontal area. Nissan installed an Android Auto infotainment system (available as an option). The car featured power-windows and mirrors, air-conditioning, and dual airbags. Datsun installed two seats at the front instead of the previously used bench and placed the jack under the driver's seat. The rear bench featured a one-piece folding seatback. Under the hood, Nissan installed a 1.2-liter, inline-three engine as the only option. The standard transmission was a five-speed manual and an option for a CVT.",DATSUN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Datsun GO"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""budget-friendly"", ""angular-shaped"", ""sculptured-shaped"", ""v-shaped"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""angular""],    ""grille"": [""hexagonal"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angular"", ""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [""daytime running lights"", ""trapezoidal""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DATSUN GO+,"In 2018, the re-introduced Datsun brand unveiled the facelifted version of the GO+ seven-seater vehicle on emerging markets and improved the vehicle's look and safety. When Nissan decided to have a budget-brand, it pulled the Datsun nameplate from the storage, dusted it off, and placed it on a refurbished 2010 Nissan Micra (K13). With a new front fascia and extended bodywork, the GO+ saw the light of day in 2014, but it wasn't the expected hit on the market. Four years later, the carmaker considered upgrading the lineup. The GO+ shared the same platform as the GO model, both based on the same platform as the former Nissan Micra. With the 2018 model update, the carmaker installed a new front bumper that included LED daytime running lights on the side scoops next to the redesigned lower grille. On its sides, the car showed the new 14"" light-alloy wheels. The GO+ featured a longer greenhouse with an additional side window behind the C-pillar. In the back, Datsun installed a windscreen wiper and, as an option, parking sensors. Inside, the GO+ featured three rows of seats. Although, judging by the interior dimensions, it was challenging to put someone in the last row. That was large enough for a shopping bag. With all seats up, the trunk was good enough for an envelope. Unlike the GO, the GO+ featured a beige dashboard with the gear-lever on the center stack. Datsun offered a new infotainment system with a touch-screen that supported Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Nissan provided the 1.2-liter, three-cylinder engine that provided 68 hp. The carmaker paired it to a five-speed manual or a CVT as an option.",DATSUN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Datsun GO+"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""Extended"",  ""overall-design"": [""Refurbished"", ""Budget-friendly"", ""Improved safety""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""Extended""],    ""grille"": [""Redesigned"", ""Lower""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED daytime running""],    ""bumper"": [""New front""],    ""wheel"": [""14\"" light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""Longer greenhouse"", ""Additional side window""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DATSUN Mi-Do,"While some were disappointed that Datsun changed its name to Nissan, the marque has been revived and brought new vehicles to the table. The new mi-DO was released in 2014 at the Moscow International Motorshow. It shared the same platform with the on-DO sedan and was a budget hatchback design to suit the everyday needs. The mi-DO was available for sale only in Russia. The small car was comfortable and Datsun equipped it with lots of safety features. Every trim level had a driver and passenger airbag, as well as ABS. Heated seats and door mirrors were offered with the standard version. The power was developed by a 1.6-liter 8V engine, producing 87 hp. The car was available with a four-speed automatic or a five-speed manual transmission. Even though it was a small car, it provided more than enough head and legroom for both front and rear passengers, as well as trunk space. The infotainment system consisted of a 7-inch LCD touch-screen display and included advanced navigation with City Guide maps and 3D display. Buyers could connect their mobile device via Bluetooth and easily make or receive calls. The exterior design was modern, with eye-catching chrome used for the car’s character lines. The look of the small car showed confidence and managed to turn heads.",DATSUN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""mi-DO"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""modern"", ""eye-catching"", ""confident""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""comfortable"", ""safe""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DATSUN on-Do,"Nissan tried to make a move in the budget-car segment and launched the Datsun brand. It was the same plan used by Renault with the Romanian brand Dacia. But Nissan chose its former name and a Russian factory. The Renault-Nissan alliance had a big share in the Russian car-company Avtovaz from Togliatti, where the Lada cars were built. To speed-up the process, Nissan took the Lada Granta model, already in production, and enhanced it with help from the Japanese engineers. On April 4, 2014, the Datsun on-DO was launched in the presence of Carlos Ghosn, the Renault-Nissan Alliance president at that time. It was hard not to notice that the Datsun on-DO was, in fact, a re-badged Lada Granta. The bodywork was similar. A honeycomb grille and angular headlights brought a fresh design look to the Russian car. Strangely though, the Granta was kept under production. In the back, the on-DO featured corner-mounted taillights, with an angular shape to match the headlights. Inside, some of its features were carried over from the other budget-car in the Alliance, the Dacia Logan. The on-DO used the same instrument panel and other switches and controls for headlights, HVAC, and gearstick. On top of that, since the car had to be fit for the hard, Russian, winters, it featured electrically heated front seats and windshield. On the options list, Datsun installed parking sensors and an infotainment system with navigation included. From the technical point of view, the on-DO offered a choice of a 1.2- or a 1.6-liter gasoline engine mated as standard to a 5-speed gearbox.",DATSUN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Datsun on-DO"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""budget"", ""fresh"", ""angular"", ""enhanced"", ""re-badged""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""electrically heated""],    ""grille"": [""honeycomb""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angular""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DODGE Durango,"Dodge unveiled the first generation of the Durango at the 1997 North American International Motor Show. The car-maker unveiled the third generation in 2011 and updated it later on almost every year. Maybe the 2021 model should have been completely new, but the car-maker didn't think it was the moment to launch it due to the world pandemic situation that led to financial difficulties for all the car-makers. Instead, they introduced a new facelift in July 2020. The manufacturer revised the headlights from the outside, which now featured LED technology both for the lamps and for the daytime running lights. The grille was enhanced as well, and a new front bumper was installed. Apart from the SRT and the SRT Hellcat versions, which featured a different hood with air-scoops, the rest of the pack featured regular ones. Inside, the manufacturer installed a new interior for the three-row SUV. A standard 8.4"" U-Connect system was fitted as standard on the SXT and GT trim levels, while from the R/T and up models, a 10.1"" touch-screen was fitted as standard. Under the hood, Dodge installed two engine choices, apart from the SRT products. There was a 3.5-liter V6 unit offered in two power options and a 5.7-liter V8 Hemi that offered 360 hp. The standard transmission for the entire range was an 8-speed automatic. Dodge offered the Durango with either rear- or an all-wheel-drive system.",DODGE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Durango"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""full-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""modern"", ""sleek"", ""aggressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""enhanced""],    ""hood"": [""different for SRT versions""],    ""headlights"": [""revised"", ""LED technology""],    ""bumper"": [""new front bumper""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DODGE Durango SRT,"When some people are growing up and need a 4-door vehicle, but they don't want to lose the driving satisfaction achieved on their previous muscle car, a Dodge Durango SRT might be the right answer. The Street and Racing Technology department from FCA (Fiat-Chrysler-Auto) developed different solutions to make the cars faster. Their involvement in cars such as the Dodge Challenger or Charger was noticed. The same department now managed to give a new heart to the Dodge Durango: the Hellcat engine. Apart from the engine, the SRT department enhanced both the exterior and the interior. From the outside, the Durango SRT Hellcat featured a modified front bumper design with a black mesh grille. The lower apron might look inappropriate for an SUV, but it looks good on the Durango, and it made a good company for the scoop in the hood. In the back, the roof-spoiler was more for show than for a real aerodynamic purpose. Inside, the SRT department didn't spare any moment to enhance the car's look and feel. The front bucket-seats looked like they belonged into a Challenger. The multi-function touch-screen display fitted into the center stack offered more menus specific for the SRT version. Some physical buttons helped the driver to get all the power and control the car. The three-rows interior provided enough room for six passengers, with two captain chairs in the middle row. Under the hood, the SRT department squeezed a V8 engine offered in two versions. The regular Durango SRT featured a naturally aspirated unit, while for the outrageous Hellcat version, the special Chrysler's department installed a supercharged unit. Both versions were mated to an 8-speed automatic gearbox. But, unlike its Challenger Hellcat brother, the Durango was fitted with an all-wheel-drive system.",DODGE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Dodge Durango SRT"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""fast"", ""enhanced"", ""aggressive"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black mesh""],    ""hood"": [""scooped""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""modified""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DODGE Challenger SRT,"When launched, the Challenger SRT Demon 170 was the quickest production car on the quarter-mile, and Dodge even offered a parachute as an option for it. The days of internal-combustion engines were numbered, and Dodge wasn't ready to ditch the famous Challenger SRT nameplate. Thus, it reworked the model and made it even more powerful and capable on the drag strip. Actually, it was so fast that the NHRA banned it from participating in official races because it lacked mandatory safety systems such as a roll cage and other devices. At first sight, the Challenger SRT Demon 170 looked similar to the rest of the range. This seventh and final special edition for this nameplate featured standard front fenders but Widebody fender flares at the back. This was necessary to accommodate the 18-by-8-inch carbon-fiber front wheels and the 17-by-11-inch rear ones. These were wrapped in Mickey Thompson 245/55R18 ET Street front tires, and P315/50R17 ET Street R drag radials, respectively. The car's front fascia featured two round headlights on the outer sides of the grille, accompanied by fake headlamps on the inner side, which were just holes with an LED circle around them that fed the massive HEMI engine of the vehicle. The car's interior was also special. It featured the ""DEMON"" specific badge next to the vents followed by the last four digit numbers from the VIN. But just because Dodge wanted to make this vehicle run in the eight-second time for the quarter-mile didn't mean that it stripped the interior. The car came fitted with AC and a Harman Kardon sound system. But the technology underneath the car was more interesting. The 6.2-liter HEMI V8 engine was helped by a three-liter supercharger that boosted the power up to 1039 hp (1053 PS) when fed with 60% ethanol-gasoline fuel. On regular, 10% ethanol fuel, it produced 900 hp (912 PS).",DODGE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Challenger SRT Demon 170"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""widebody"",  ""overall-design"": [""powerful"", ""aggressive"", ""muscular"", ""special"", ""fast""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""round"", ""fake"", ""LED-accented""],    ""hood"": [""standard""],    ""headlights"": [""round"", ""outer"", ""fake inner""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""18-by-8-inch front"", ""17-by-11-inch rear"", ""carbon-fiber""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""massive""]  }}```"
DODGE Charger SRT,"The fastest sedan in the world doesn't have a three or four-letter acronym, nor does it have a two-word name, and is a Dodge. The Charger Hellcat is, with its 707hp and 196 mph (300 kph) top speed, the fastest three-box sedan in the world, as of 2019. The 0-60 mph (0-96 kph) sprint is achieved in 3.9 seconds and the model deserved a better look. That's when the Widebody came. The Widebody Hellcat Charger was first shown in 2019 and it has a mean look as standard for the Hellcat version, but the body kit is also available to order on the Charger Scat Pack. The wide body kit adds 3.5 inches (88.9 mm) to the width of the car, creating a more aggressive stance with a new set of fender flares, which are making room for a set of wheels with Pirelli 305/35ZR20 tires. Brembo six-piston front calipers with two-piece front brake rotors and unique suspension tuning with Bilstein three-mode adaptive damping combine to improve handling performance. The whole package fits the image for the 707 hp four-door muscle car perfectly. A new, important improvement is the new EPS (electronic power steering), installed for the first time in the Charger. The Hellcat Widebody showcased the transition from a straight-line acceleration muscle car to a real sports sedan. The Hellcat Widebody can be more aggressive on the curves and can brake in a shorter distance. It was made to compete against European power-sedans, with a little help from the Italians, but still following the American way with a V8 6.2 supercharged gasoline engine.",DODGE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Charger Hellcat"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""mean"", ""widebody"", ""muscular"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""mean"", ""aggressive""],    ""hood"": [""muscular""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""aggressive""],    ""wheel"": [""wide"", ""Pirelli 305/35ZR20""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""aggressive""],    ""exhaust"": [""powerful""]  }}```"
DODGE Challenger,"Dodge continued to improve its muscle car coupe with the 2015 model. The modern iteration of the original 1971 Challenger is a tribute to the era when power and quarter mile runs were the keys to success for performance cars. The new, facelifted, 2015 Dodge Challenger comes with a big, important improvement on the transmission sector where the older, 5-speed automatic transmission was replaced with a new, 8-speed ZF gearbox. In the engine compartment, there is a V6 and few V8 gasoline engines, with or without a supercharger. The reintroduction of the Scat Pack with a naturally aspirated 6.4-liter V8 engine offers 485 hp and 644 Nm (475 lb.-ft) of torque. Dodge fans who are looking for the 5.7-liter Hemi engine, that one is offered on the R/T lineup with 375 hp and 556 Nm (410 lb.-ft) of torque. This version can be mated with a choice of two manual 6-speed transmissions or with an 8-speed automatic. If the optional Tremec 6-speed manual is chosen, then you can expect the acceleration from 0 to 60 mph (96 kph) to take less than 5 seconds. The base engine was the 3.6-liter Pentastar engine, which offered 305 hp. The interior was heavily reworked and more technology was added, with the Uconnect Acces interface.",DODGE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Dodge Challenger"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""big"",  ""overall-design"": [""modern"", ""facelifted"", ""powerful"", ""tribute"", ""reworked""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""facelifted""],    ""hood"": [""reworked""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DODGE Ram,"Dodge introduced the Ram's third generation in 2009, trying to get a head-start against its main competitor, the Ford F-150. The after-effects of the world financial crisis were not done yet when Dodge introduced the third generation of the Ram pickup, just in time to help to put back the economy on wheels. Its four-door, full-size cabin, and the potent Hemi engine were some of its main attributes. Dodge built the Ram as a trustworthy all-around vehicle fit for work and play. The four-door version could get a construction team to the working site and carry the whole family and a trailer behind, up to the mountains or to a lake, whichever comes first. Its design with a massive grille at the front and Dodge's cross-hair design was impressive. The headlights were tall and wide but installed like on older, 1950's pickups. On the sides, depending on the options, the carmaker installed side steps and chromed door mirrors. In the back, Dodge offered an option for RamBox bins, well concealed in the rear fenders, on the sides of the bed. Inside, the Ram provided plenty of space for five adults with some room to spare for a fourth passenger on the bench, if needed. With its tall and wide dashboard, the Ram offered more of a truck experience than a car-like sensation. Yet, the carmaker considered that some posh and up-market feel would be welcomed and added an option for wood trims on the center stack and door panels. Under the hood, Dodge installed a choice of three gasoline engines and a turbo-diesel built by Cummins. The latter was the torquiest of them all, while the 5.7-liter was not exactly eco-friendly.",DODGE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ram"",  ""year"": ""2009"",  ""size"": ""full-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""trustworthy"", ""impressive"", ""massive"", ""potent"", ""spacious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""impressive""],    ""hood"": [""tall"", ""wide""],    ""headlights"": [""tall"", ""wide"", ""retro""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""chromed""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DODGE Hornet,"The Hornet nameplate might not be new, but it's fresh on a Dodge production vehicle, and even though it was supposed to be a hatchback in 2011, it ended up as a compact crossover eleven years later. Sharing its underpinnings and assembly lines with the Italian Alfa Romeo Tonale, the Hornet returned the nameplate from history bins. First, it belonged to the Hudson brand, which was bought together with the AMC by Chrysler in 1987. Then, in 2006, the American carmaker showed a concept car named Dodge Hornet. Still, the project was axed in the turmoil of the world financial crisis. But in 2022, the Hornet finally made it to the market. The curved body style was penned in Italy and adapted for the U.S. brand with specific ""angry-looking"" headlights that flanked a slim upper grille. At the same time, the lower apron sported a broad air intake and two side slats for cooling the engine and the brakes. Its profile resembled the one from the Alfa Romeo Tonale and Giulietta, with an arched roofline sloped to the back on the tailgate. Inside, the Hornet featured a standard 12.3"" digital instrument cluster and a 10.25"" touch screen display for the infotainment unit placed atop the center stack. The front bucket seats fitted as standard could've been replaced with high-bolstered ones that gave more side support during high-speed cornering. At the back, there was hardly any room for three adults, especially since the middle one had to sit above the transmission tunnel. The Dart was the first electrified Dodge. Besides the turbocharged gasoline engine, it featured a 25-hp electric motor to improve acceleration times. In addition, a gasoline-only version was also available. It used a turbocharged, 2.0-liter inline-four carried over from Alfa Romeo's parts bin.",DODGE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Hornet"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""compact crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""curved body style"", ""angry-looking headlights"", ""arched roofline"", ""sloped tailgate"", ""high-bolstered seats""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""curved""],    ""grille"": [""slim upper grille""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angry-looking""],    ""bumper"": [""broad air intake""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""arched"", ""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DS AUTOMOBILES DS 7,"Citroen introduced the DS as its stand-alone premium brand in 2015. The DS7 Crossback appeared on the market two years later and was updated in 2022. With the facelifted version of the DS7 Crossback, Citroen tried to prove that it learned how to create a premium-segment vehicle. Moreover, it had to offer more and exceed expectations to be taken seriously in a market dominated by German and British brands. The DS7 Crossback facelift was brought on the market by the French carmaker in the summer of 2022. Its exterior underwent an aesthetic upgrade, and the car received a new set of LED headlights fitted with PIXEL LED 3.0 technology. In addition, the carmaker installed 84 light-emitting diodes arranged in three rows in each headlamp. Moreover, the veil-type DRLs on the front bumper clearly provide a unique look on the market. Depending on the trim level, the front fascia was completely black, including the DS logo that took center stage on the grill. Inside, the cabin was already praised for the materials used. However, users claimed there was room for improvement, so DS tried again to meet or exceed their expectations. Thus, the extensive use of alcantara and leather led to a much nicer interior than before. In addition, the seats sported various patterns, depending on the customer's choices and the car's trim level. But the French carmaker understood that premium-segment car buyers will not take a beautiful vehicle with a weak engine wouldseriously. That forced DS to introduce two new plug-in hybrid powertrains that provided up to 360 PS (355 HP) for the top-of-the-range, all-wheel drive version.",DS AUTOMOBILES,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""DS7 Crossback"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""aesthetic"", ""unique"", ""black fascia"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black"", ""center stage""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""PIXEL LED 3.0"", ""84 light-emitting diodes"", ""aesthetic""],    ""bumper"": [""veil-type DRLs"", ""unique look""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DS AUTOMOBILES DS 3,"DS Automobiles, Citroen's premium brand, introduced a facelifted version of the DS 3 Crossback in late 2022 for the 2023 model year and made some unusual changes. The French automaker introduced the DS 3 crossover as a version of the three-door hatchback DS 3 and even named it ""Crossback."" But when the brand facelifted the vehicle, it also dropped that additional nameplate. It's not a step back but a different approach to the market—a market where the car didn't manage to attract too many customers. Starting with the 2023 model year, the DS 3 not only that it lost its ""Crossback"" suffix but also the halogen headlamps as well. The automaker stopped offering them, and the entire range sported LED headlights. In addition, the facelifted version received a new lower spoiler fitted with aerofoils that surrounded the air intake. Inside, DS Automobiles used only premium materials such as Nappa Leather and Alcantara. Furthermore, there was a new 10.3"" high-definition infotainment display that controlled most of the auxiliary systems inside the vehicle. Also, the automaker installed new high-density foam when making the seats, thus improving comfort and providing better side support for front passengers. Under the hood, the 2023 DS 3 received improved engines and a more powerful electric version that provided 20 more ponies to the front wheels.",DS AUTOMOBILES,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""DS 3 Crossback"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""facelifted"", ""unusual"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""new"", ""fitted""],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""lower"", ""spoiler"", ""aerofoils""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""premium"", ""Nappa Leather"", ""Alcantara""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""improved"", ""more powerful""]  }}```"
DS AUTOMOBILES DS 3 Crossback,"In 2018, Citroen launched the smallest crossover built under the DS brand, which tried to breach into the premium segment with a unique design and attractive features. Once a premium brand, Citroen tried to get back to that segment, but it failed constantly. It ended up being bought by Peugeot and later incorporated into the Stellantis group. However, its efforts were not in vain since it produced a few attractive vehicles that could fit in the upscale market, such as the DS 3 Crossback. The high-rider vehicle was packed with the best materials and technical bits and pieces the French brand had in its basket. In addition, it made the car on the newly developed CMP platform reserved for larger cars. With a look front fascia dominated by a broad grille surrounded by a chromed trim, the DS3 Crossback tried to look commanding on the road. Its LED headlights featured four blocks and were continued downward by vertical, waved-shaped slats. On the lower side of the bumper, the automaker added a chin and two decorative scoops. From its profile, the sculptured door panels formed a wide V-shaped line, while the rear doors featured fang-like shapes toward the B-pillars. The back of the DS3 Crossback was also bold, with chromed elements surrounding the taillights and visually connecting them via a horizontal slat on the raked-forward tailgate. Underneath the bumper, two wide-sized exhausts gave the vehicle a sporty look. Inside, the cabin boasted a high level of refinement with diamond-shaped leather on the dashboard and seats. In front of the driver, the automaker installed a flat-bottom steering wheel covered in leather and a digital instrument cluster. In addition, a head-up display showed essential information on a retractable transparent screen. Atop the center stack, the automaker added the touchscreen for the infotainment system. The rest of the cabin was adorned with rhomboidal shapes, including the vents. In the back, the split-folding bench seat was wide enough for three passengers, although not full-grown adults, due to the limited headroom and legroom. Despite looking like a crossover, the car was not offered with an all-wheel-drive system. Citroen installed only front-wheel-drive drivetrains on it. Moreover, the McPherson struts at the front and the torsion-bar rear suspension were not exactly the best what a premium vehicle could have. The automaker said that it did this to provide a larger trunk, even though that wasn’t too large either. On the plus side, customers could get the DS 3 Crossback with a wide choice of engines, ranging from three turbocharged gasoline ones and ending up with an electric drivetrain. In 2018, there were not too many automakers to offer that on the market since the technology was new. For those looking for cars with long range, Citroen installed a choice of three fuel-efficient turbo-diesel powerplants.",DS AUTOMOBILES,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""DS 3 Crossback"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""small crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""unique"", ""attractive"", ""premium"", ""bold"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""four blocks"", ""vertical"", ""waved-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [""chin"", ""decorative scoops""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured"", ""wide V-shaped line"", ""fang-like shapes""],    ""roof"": [""raked-forward""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""wide-sized""],    ""interior"": [""refined"", ""diamond-shaped leather"", ""rhomboidal shapes"", ""wide enough for three passengers""],    ""drivetrain"": [""front-wheel-drive"", ""wide choice of engines"", ""turbocharged"", ""electric"", ""fuel-efficient turbo-diesel""]  }}```"
DS AUTOMOBILES DS 5,"The 2016 DS5 was the Citroen's premium brand. It evolved from being a top of the line product to a separate car brand. The French car-maker tried to do with the DS what the Honda did with Acura. Before the 2016 DS5 there was the 2012 Citroen DS5. It might be considered as a facelift with a new badge on the car since there were absolutely no Citroen badges on the vehicle. But that didn't say that the car was not built by Citroen. The DS5 was the flagship of the French car-maker and it tried to build it as good as it could, but with a price-tag limit on its mind. The egg-shape of the vehicle was a hatchback but styled to not look just like a regular compact MPV. It featured a floating roof design, thanks to the enlarged and Z-shaped rear quarter panels. The headlights were long and integrated nicely into a front fascia that tried to become specific for the DS brand. Inside, the cabin was arranged as a cockpit. There were buttons on the center console, on the right side of the steering wheel, on the dashboard, and even on the car's ceiling. It was imagined as an airplane cockpit. Just like the Citroen DS, a car design by aircraft engineers. Unlike most of the Citroen products, the DS5 was carefully crafted with big attention to details. The drivetrain featured platforms taken from other cars from the PSA (Peugeot-Citroen) group. It was offered with a choice of turbocharged gasoline and diesel units. A special hybrid diesel-electric was available, with an all-wheel-drive system. A 6-speed transmission was fitted as standard.",DS AUTOMOBILES,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""DS5"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""hatchback"",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""flagship"", ""stylish"", ""aerodynamic"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sleek""],    ""grille"": [""specific"", ""stylish""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""long"", ""integrated""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""floating"", ""enlarged"", ""Z-shaped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DS AUTOMOBILES DS 4,"In February 2021, DS Automobiles introduced the second generation of its compact crossover contender, the DS 4. Back in the '50s and '60s, Citroen was considered a premium brand, and the phenomenal DS model was iconic for the French brand. Over time, Citroen's aura started to fade, and it became just a shadow of the glorious brand it used to be. But that was changed in 2015 when the company's management decided to restore its golden age and introduced the DS Automobile as a premium brand for Citroen. The new brand evolved from Citroen as a premium carmaker in the same way that Infiniti grew from Nissan, Lexus from Toyota, or Acura from Honda. The DS4 was a creative mix between a compact and a crossover vehicle. By 2021, its three LED headlamps were already a lighting signature for the French carmaker. Its broad grille extended from the hood to the bottom of the apron, filling the space between the headlights, was a bold statement for the French carmaker. The sloped C-pillars enhanced the car's sporty look in a way that only the glorious Citroen SM dared to be. Inside, the French designers imagined a cabin with an exclusive look and high-quality materials. They mixed the refinement and the technology in a way that few carmakers could ever do. The leather-wrapped dashboard featured a center-mounted infotainment touch-screen and another TFT display in the instrument cluster. Based on the EMP2 platform, the DS4 shared its underpinning with other Citroen and Peugeot products. It featured a wide range of diesel, gasoline, and plug-in hybrid powertrains.",DS AUTOMOBILES,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""DS 4"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""sporty"", ""exclusive"", ""refined"", ""bold""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""broad""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
DS AUTOMOBILES DS 9,"The DS brand has evolved from the French Citroen brand into a different company, with specially designed vehicles. DS cars aren't just rebadged and refurbished Citroen models, but they still use the same technical platforms, with a completely different look and image. DS' latest product should have been shown at the 2020 Geneva Motor Show. Unfortunately, the show was canceled but the vehicle will be available soon in dedicated DS showrooms. It is based on the same EMP2 platform as the Peugeot 508. Some design features might be similar from one to the other but the luxurious interior of the DS9 is unique. The DS9 will be offered with the new E-TENSE plug-in hybrid powertrain. It comprises a turbocharged gasoline engine and an electric motor. The total output is 225hp and is able to drive 40-50 km (25-31 miles) in electric mode. The battery pack has 11.9 kWh. The electric motor has 110 hp and 320 Nm (236 lb.-ft) of torque and drives the wheels via an 8-speed automatic gearbox. Soon there are going to be other powertrain options as well, including an all-wheel-drive hybrid version with a 360 hp combined output.

FERRARI F8,"In 2019, Ferrari introduced the open-top version of the F8 Tributo and added the traditional Spider word after the F8 nameplate. The car retained most of the characteristics of its closed-coupe sibling since it was developed in parallel with it. Ferrari continued the story of the 458 and 488 with the F8 Tributo in 2019, followed by the open-top version of it in the same year. While some considered that it was more of a heavily facelifted version of the 488, it was more like a new car on older but upgraded underpinnings. The Italian automaker already had all the ingredients to create the Spider version when it introduced the Tributo at the Geneva Motor Show but made its customers wait a while since the closed-top model was the one that sparked the imagination of those who could race such a beautiful vehicle on a track, in friendly races. The Italian automaker chose to pen the vehicle inside its styling center, which Flavio Manzoni led it. At the front, the LED headlights had a boomerang shape underlined by daytime running lights. On the lower side of the front fascia, Ferrari installed a broad splitter flanked by two small air inlets that grabbed the air and cooled the front rotors. An extracting vent placed on the front lid helped the F8 Spider to stick to the ground and created downforce for the prancing-horse supercar. From its profile, the open-top vehicle featured a similar windshield and sculptured door panels as its sibling. Ferrari opted for a retractable hard-top solution, and the roof could’ve been retracted in 14 seconds at a speed of up to 45 kph (28 MPH). Behind the cabin, Ferrari installed two bulges behind the seats that also covered the safety arches. There was no sloped rear windscreen. Last but not least, at the back, the F8 Spider featured a wing on the engine cover and quad exhausts underneath the rear bumper, poking through the massive diffuser. Inside its cabin, the F8 Spider revealed a cabin for two occupants. The high-bolstered bucket seats were padded with expensive leather and were separated by the center console. Unlike many other cars on the market, this was not connected to the center stack to amplify the sensation of lightness. But light didn’t mean low-equipped, so the F8 Spider featured a 7” touchscreen placed in front of the passenger, who could assist the driver by selecting music. The one behind the wheel had to focus only on driving, fronting an instrument cluster where a large tachometer took center stage. It was flanked by two LCDs for the infotainment unit and the navigation system. In addition, these could also show information gathered from the car’s onboard computer. The F8 Spider was lighter than the 488 Spider, and the Italian car manufacturer struggled to provide the best available solutions to lose pounds. In addition, it increased the performance of the 3.9-liter V8 twin-turbocharged powerplant by 50 PS (49 HP) compared to its predecessor.",FERRARI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""F8 Spider"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""sporty"", ""elegant"", ""aggressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""similar"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""sculptured""],    ""headlights"": [""boomerang-shaped"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""broad splitter"", ""extracting vent"", ""massive diffuser""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [""retractable hard-top""],    ""diffusor"": [""massive""],    ""spoiler"": [""wing on engine cover""],    ""exhaust"": [""quad""]  }}```"
FERRARI Portofino,"Three years after the introduction of the Portofino at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show, the Italian car-maker introduced the M version for it, a more powerful version for the open-top supercar. In the Italian's brand designation, M stood for “Modificata” (Modified), which meant an improvement of an existing model. Since it was a Ferrari, those modifications were about more power and better performances than of the model it evolved from. From the outside, the Portofino M featured a redesigned front and rear bumper. The rest of the car was very similar to the standard Portofino. It was understandable since the Italian car-maker was in lockdown due to the COVID 19 pandemic. The M version was the first Ferrari launched exclusively online. The interior of the Portofino M featured a new central horizontal aluminum blade that divided the instrument panel, the air conditioning vents, and the passenger display into separate areas. The other control functions were located in the lower section, with a 10.25” touchscreen in the middle of the center stack. The drivetrain was heavily upgraded. While the displacement and the torque remained the same, the power was increased from 600 to 620 hp. The twin-turbo V8 engine was paired to a new, 8-speed, dual-clutch gearbox. It sent all the power to the rear wheels via an electronically controlled differential. The performances were improved over its predecessor. Another new update was the addition of a gasoline particulate filter (GPF), to lower emissions and comply with the Euro 6d standards.",FERRARI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Portofino M"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""powerful"", ""open-top"", ""redesigned"", ""improved"", ""exclusive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""redesigned""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FERRARI 296 GTS,"Open-top vehicles were always part of the Ferrari's lineup, and, in 2022, the Italian carmaker introduced a new model, the 296 GTS. Based on the 2021 296 GTB, the Spyder continued the idea of placing retractable hardtops instead of the ragtops used on older Ferrari convertibles. That not only added more practicality for the users but also allowed the carmaker to create a shape that also provided more comfort and safety than a regular ragtop vehicle. The shape was already known from the coupe, or berlinetta, as the carmaker insisted on calling it. At the front, the supercar sported a broad grille extended from one side to the other of the apron, with a narrower gap in the middle section. This was used for cooling the electrical system since the 296 architecture was a plug-in hybrid one. Its sides revealed deeply sculptured doors on their mid-upper section, making room for the air-intake placed above the rear wheels, one on each side of the vehicle. Those were used for both cooling and feeding the engine. The hardtop was pivoting on rear-mounted hinges and hid under a hard cover above the engine compartment. It only needed 14 seconds for this operation, at speeds up to 45 kph (72 kph), meaning that it could have been operated anytime while driving within city speed limits. Like its coupe sibling, the 296 GTS featured two sport bucket seats with high bolstered areas that helped during high-speed cornering. The dashboard design, with its fighter-jet-inspired design, sported an instrument cluster. On the center console, Ferrari showed a modern interpretation of the classic gear-shift gate and a storage compartment for the car's key. Since it was a plug-in hybrid, the car combined the power of a twin-turbo V6 with an electric motor for a total output of 830 hp. It was mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission that sent the power to the rear wheels. The system offered the driver to use the 296 GTS in a full-electric mode for a maximum of 25 kilometers (15.5 miles), which was enough for a daily commute by European standards.",FERRARI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""296 GTS"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""practical"", ""comfortable"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""retractable"", ""sleek""],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""extended"", ""cooling""],    ""hood"": [""sculptured""],    ""headlights"": [""sporty""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""rear-mounted""],    ""doors"": [""sculptured"", ""mid-upper""],    ""roof"": [""hardtop"", ""pivoting""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""plug-in hybrid""]  }}```"
FERRARI 488 Pista,"Based on the Ferrari 488 GTB, the 2018 Ferrari Pista offered 50 more horsepower than its sibling and it was built for track action, as its name suggested (Pista = track). The true successor of the Ferrari 360 Challenge Stradale, 430 Scuderia, and 458 Speciale was designed for those who are regularly taking their cars to the race-track. After an intensive diet program, the 488 Pista lost 90 kgs (198 lbs) from the standard 488 GTB. The underbody aerodynamics was changed so the car would gain more downforce from the ground effect. From the outside, the 488 Pista had few details that differentiated it from the standard 488. For instance, the wheels were made out of carbon fiber. That detail was important not only for the total weight of the car but also for reducing the unsprung masses, thus improving the handling. Also in the back, the bodywork element that connected the taillights was made out of carbon fiber. The same material was used for the rear diffuser. Inside the car, everything was made out of Alcantara and carbon-fiber. While the first was used for the dashboard, upper door panels, and seat upholstery, most of the other items were made out of carbon-fiber. The engine was the most powerful V8 engine ever made by the Ferrari. With its 720 hp mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox. It was rear-wheel-drive.",FERRARI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ferrari Pista"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""track-focused"", ""lightweight"", ""aerodynamic"", ""carbon-fiber details"", ""powerful""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""carbon-fiber""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""carbon-fiber""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FERRARI GTC4Lusso T,"Ferrari lost four cylinders from the GTC4Lusso, but it didn't lose its appeal when it built the GTC4Lusso T but gained in sport-response and agility. The design was the same as its V12 sibling, the GTC4Lusso, with a shooting-brake appearance and the same long hood as a front-engine Ferrari. It had an option for 20"" light-alloy wheels. The GTC4Lusso T had an HD 10.25-inch touchscreen, a 1.5 GHz CPU, and the sort of responsive, interactive usability a lot of cars could only dream about. It's also nice how Ferrari has designed the dashboard to wrap around it so it's fully integrated rather than stand-out of the dashboard-proud. And, most important, the passenger next to the driver has its own display dedicated to the audio system. Think like the driver has a personal DJ on the road. With the 3.9-liter V8 engine installed and an increased weight bias toward the rear (46:54%), and the re-calibrated 4-wheel-steering system, the vehicle was more responsive both in entering and entering the corners. Finally, the tech upgrade is huge and it starts with a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox, dual-coil adaptive dampers, and the 9th generation ESP.  Unlike its sibling, the Ferrari GTC4Lusso, it was only RWD. In order to make the car faster, the electronic-controlled rear differential was re-tuned for a faster response. Last, but not least, the four-wheel steering gives more handling in the parking lot and on the track.",FERRARI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""GTC4Lusso T"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""shooting-brake appearance"", ""long hood"", ""20\"" light-alloy wheels""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""long""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""20\"" light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FERRARI 812,"Two years after the introduction of its flagship model, the Gran Tourer 812 Superfast, Ferrari unveiled the open-top version of it, traditionally named GTS. While the era of naturally aspirated engines was coming to an end, the Italian automaker released the 812 Superfast with its most powerful atmospheric production engines ever. But there was a problem with that. Its grand tourer was usually very well insulated from the exterior sounds, and that included the engine’s music. So, the only way its customers could listen to it was to drive with their windows down. But when that was not good enough for them, the car manufacturer released the 812 GTS. Now, the recipe was complete and kept its customers happy. The 812 Superfast followed the long lineage of high-performance vehicles made for long distances, such as the 365 GTB4 (Daytona), the 456, or the F12. As a result, it had the powerplant in front of the cabin but behind the front axle, meaning that it was a front-mid-engine vehicle. That resulted in a very long hood, where the automaker’s designers placed two discrete air-intakes next to the headlights. The entire front fascia was carried over from its coupe sibling, or Berlinetta, as Ferrari named that type of bodywork. From its profile, there were the same vents behind the front wheel arches that extracted the air from inside the wheel wells. But from the waistline up, it was different. The power-retractable hard top could be concealed behind the cabin at the touch of a button, and the driver and their passenger sat exposed under the sky. Behind them, Ferrari placed two safety arches neatly concealed by two humps in the back. For the two-seat cabin, Ferrari opted for expensive, luxurious materials such as leather, carbon fiber, and aluminum trims. In front of the driver was the same instrument cluster with a large rev counter that took center stage and was flanked by two TFT displays for additional data gathered from the vehicle’s onboard computer. Like in the 812 Superfast, there was a small screen in front of the passenger displaying the information for the audio system, the tachometer, the speedometer, and other data that they didn’t need but wanted to see. The retractable hard top could be retracted in just 14 seconds at speeds of up to 45 kph (28 mph) at the flick of a switch. Finally, at the back, the automaker made additional changes to compensate for the lack of a fixed roof. As a result, there was a new diffuser underneath the bumper. Under the hood was the same naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V12 that powered the 812 Superfast. The insane specific power of 123,14 PS/liter (121.45 hp/liter) was obtained at a stratospheric 8,500 rpm. All the power was sent to the rear wheels via a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox via an electronically-controlled limited-slip differential.",FERRARI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""812 GTS"",  ""year"": ""unspecified"",  ""size"": ""long hood"",  ""overall-design"": [""powerful"", ""luxurious"", ""open-top"", ""front-mid-engine"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""discrete air-intakes""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""long""],    ""headlights"": [""sleek""],    ""bumper"": [""new diffuser""],    ""wheel"": [""rear wheels""],    ""doors"": [""power-retractable""],    ""roof"": [""power-retractable hard top""],    ""diffusor"": [""underneath the bumper""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""naturally aspirated""]  }}```"
FERRARI Daytona,"Ferrari unveiled a stunning limited series vehicle in late 2021 when it unveiled the Daytona SP3 model, a hypercar that recalled a glorious racing moment of the Italian carmaker's past. In 1967, at Daytona, on Ford's home ground, three Ferrari racing cars ended the 24 hours race on the podium, leaving the Blue Oval brand in tears. It was the payback for Ferrari's defeat from the 1966 Le Mans race. Come 2021, and the Italian carmaker built a unique vehicle that evoked that magnificent victory from Daytona and named it Daytona SP3. It was more than just another livery and some fancy seatbelts. It was based on the LaFerrari platform, albeit the hybrid technology. At the front, the car featured an unusual grille design integrated into the front bumper. Its mesh-grille design sported the Prancing Horse chromed badge in the middle and was flanked by side scoops with four horizontal fins that channeled the air to the sides of the car. In addition, its partly covered headlights featured a lower LED strip for the daytime running lights, while the front fenders resembled those from the Ferrari 330 P3/4 racecar. Its profile revealed a five-spoke wheels design and an aggressive ascending line. Its open-top cabin featured a tall safety arch behind the seats, followed by the angled side pillars that flanked the engine cover. In addition, Ferrari designers installed a unique design for the car at the back with four full-length horizontal slats followed by another pair of two slats divided by the center-mounted dual exhaust with rectangular pipes. The powerplant was a naturally-aspirated V12 derived from the one fitted in the Ferrari 812 Superfast but tuned with titanium connecting rods and a revised crankshaft. Its 6.5-liter displacement provided 830 hp and 514 lb-ft (697 Nm) of torque. The engine was paired to a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox, which powered the rear wheels.",FERRARI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Daytona SP3"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""stunning"", ""unique"", ""aggressive"", ""open-top"", ""powerful""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""unusual"", ""integrated"", ""mesh"", ""chromed"", ""flanked""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""partly covered"", ""lower LED strip""],    ""bumper"": [""front"", ""integrated""],    ""wheel"": [""five-spoke""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""open-top"", ""tall safety arch"", ""angled side pillars""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual"", ""rectangular""]  }}```"
FERRARI 296 GTB,"The era of hybrid supercars had already begun when the Italian automaker introduced the 296 GTB on the market in 2022, but it used the technology not just to save fuel but also to add performance. It wasn't Ferrari's first hybrid vehicle. That credit goes to the 2019 SF90. In just a few years, the Italian car manufacturer gained a lot of experience in doing these kinds of vehicles. It gained experience thanks to F1 racing and then added some other technologies. With all of these combined and matched to fit under a beautiful bodywork designed in the Ferrari Styling Center by Flavio Manzoni, the 296 GTB broke covers in June 2021. Like all mid-engined supercars made by Ferrari, the 296 GTB sported a short nose and a slim front area to minimize drag. Still, a lower bumper fitted with an air dam that housed a center air intake and two side scoops provided additional downforce to the vehicle. The vehicle's profile revealed a raked windshield and a short roof above the cabin. Even though the rear windscreen was vertical, the designer had created side, sloped-down posts that made the cabin look longer. At the back, the muscular-looking quarter panels featured up-mounted air intakes for the engine. Finally, the rear fascia sported two pairs of round LED taillights and a center-mounted exhaust above the underbody's diffuser. The cabin boasted a pair of sports seats wrapped in Alcantara and leather. Ferrari mounted the driver's seat between the front and rear axle in the middle to enhance feedback. On the dashboard, a digital display showed various functions of the vehicle, including a wide tachometer and the battery status. The low center console featured a cup holder and the controls for the gearbox. But one of the most particular parts of the interior was the steering wheel that sported shift lights incorporated into the rim on the upper section. Moreover, it was also fitted with main controls for lights, turn signals, wipers, and the famous ""Manettino"" drive-mode selector. Powering this hybrid supercar was a 120-degree V6 engine, helped by a pair of turbochargers that spooled between cylinder banks. In addition, an electric motor of 167 PS (165 hp) completed the power department for a total of 830 PS (819 hp). Thanks to a 7.45 kWh battery pack, the 296 GTB plug-in hybrid could drive up to 25 kilometers (15.5 miles).",FERRARI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""296 GTB"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""mid-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""hybrid"", ""performance-oriented"", ""aerodynamic"", ""muscular"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""short""],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""lower"", ""air dam""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sports""],    ""roof"": [""short""],    ""diffusor"": [""underbody""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""center-mounted""]  }}```"
FERRARI Purosangue,"After 75 years on the market, the famous Italian brand Ferrari introduced its first official production vehicle with four doors and four seats and named it Purosangue (thoroughbred). Just like Porsche, who had to create the Cayenne to survive, the Italian supercar-maker Ferrari understood that the era of niche vehicles was gone. There were not enough buyers for its products, so it had to find new territories. It found it in the crossover segment with a vehicle named by the Italian carmaker as more of an evolved GT, not an SUV. The car's shape is absolutely a Ferrari one. Its long hood, raked windshield, and sloped roofline resembled the same idea seen on the Ferrari FF. In addition, the enlarged, muscular quarter panels evoked many supercars that came from Maranello. At the back, the quad-exhaust and the half-circular taillights were already a common sight on several vehicles produced by the Italian manufacturer. Inside, Ferrari created a four-seat cabin with high-bolstered front and rear seats. Moreover, the center console was extended to clearly separate the front occupants. In addition, a similarly-shaped console was placed between the rear occupants. For the dashboard, Ferrari made an instrument cluster for the driver and an additional touch-screen for the front side passenger. Under the hood, the carmaker installed a front mid-mounted V12 engine behind the front axle. It was naturally aspirated and featured a direct fuel-injected system that helped the carmaker provide enough oomph for its customers. The powerplant was paired as standard to a seven-speed, dual-clutch, automatic gearbox that transferred the torque in all corners.",FERRARI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Purosangue"",  ""year"": ""N/A"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""evolved GT"", ""crossover"", ""long hood"", ""raked windshield"", ""sloped roofline"", ""enlarged, muscular quarter panels"", ""quad-exhaust"", ""half-circular taillights"", ""four-seat cabin"", ""high-bolstered seats"", ""front mid-mounted V12 engine""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""long""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""quad""],    ""interior"": [""four-seat cabin"", ""high-bolstered seats"", ""extended center console"", ""instrument cluster"", ""touch-screen""]  }}```"
FERRARI Monza,"The 2018 Ferrari Monza SP1 was designed for the driver who doesn't want to take any passenger along the road. The one-seater vehicle was built mostly for collectors. The car was inspired by the 1955 Ferrari 750 with one seat and track-days in mind. But the SP1 was legal to drive on the public roads. It was accompanied by the SP2 model, a vehicle that offered a passenger seat, so the driver could enjoy a companion. The low profile of the vehicle showed no room for a windscreen, while the big hump behind the driver hid the roll-over protection bar. With a seat designed and tailored to the exact driver dimensions, the Monza SP1 was built for those who would enjoy a track-day as much as the road to there. A radical choice was made for the design of the cars' compact doors which open upwards. Equally important is the all-carbon-fiber one-piece hood-wing assembly which was hinged at the front to showcase the V12 engine once opened. The ""Virtual Wind Shield"" deviated a part of the airflow to maintain driving comfort. But still, the driver had to wear a helmet. The dashboard consisted of one, big, a tachometer, and two screens on its sides. The whole commands and controls for headlights, turn signals, and on-board computer were placed on the steering wheel. The light, barchetta configuration ensured a high-performance dynamic and uncompromising sports car handling.",FERRARI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ferrari Monza SP1"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""low-profile"", ""radical"", ""high-performance"", ""dynamic"", ""barchetta""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""non-existent"", ""virtual""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""one-piece"", ""carbon-fiber"", ""hinged""],    ""headlights"": [""compact""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""compact"", ""upward-opening""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FERRARI F60 America,"Ferrari decided to celebrate its 60th Anniversary in America with a special model: the 60 America. An open-to roadster built especially for ten customers. The first Ferrari ever sold in the U.S. was the Tipo 166 Spyder Corsa. It was a race-car with two seats and no roof. The difference is that the F60 America was not a race-car, but was a roadster well. The F60 America was based upon the Ferrari F12. It featured the same long hood with a stripe in the middle. The prancing-horse on a yellow shield was applied on the front fenders, just in case that someone wouldn't know that that was a Ferrari. A raked windshield followed. Behind the cockpit, there were two security arches, raked forward and painted in silver. For rainy days, Ferrari designed a special, light, top that could provide some cover for the occupants. Inside, on the center tunnel, there was another pair of the 60th Anniversary Prancing-horse badge. The driver's area was bigger than its passenger. The asymmetrical design was studied to offer maximum comfort for the one behind the wheel. The sport-bucket seats with leather and Alcantara upholstery designed for maximum support while fast cornering. The F60 America was not just a show car, but a true track-oriented car. For the drivetrain, the exclusive model was powered by the same 6.3-liter engine from the Ferrari F12, mated to the same 7-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox.",FERRARI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""F60 America"",  ""year"": ""60th Anniversary"",  ""size"": ""roadster"",  ""overall-design"": [""celebratory"", ""sporty"", ""asymmetrical"", ""track-oriented""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""long"", ""striped""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""asymmetrical""],    ""roof"": [""open-top"", ""light""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FERRARI Roma Convertible,"Customers had to wait for almost three years to see the open-top version of the Ferrari Roma, but the result made them forget about the time spent refreshing the carmaker's page, hoping to see the Spider version unveiled. And yet, it happened in the Spring of 2023, just in time for some customers to order it and enjoy the vehicle before the Summer ended. The engineers from Maranello worked hard to create an open-top version of the Roma without compromising this grand touring car's dynamics. Thus, the Roma Spider was just 84 kilos (185 lbs) heavier than its hardtop sibling. But that wasn't all. At the flick of a switch, the Roma Spider could fold its roof in just 13.5 seconds at speeds of up to 60 kph (37 mph), which was about 10 kph (6 mph) more than the speed limits in most European countries. Of course, by cutting the roof, the automaker had to redesign the rear side of the vehicle, and it did that flawlessly. It looks like the Ferrari Styling Center, led by Flavio Manzoni, penned the car right from the start to get a folding roof. Which is what it most probably did. Behind the cabin featured a cover seamlessly integrated into the rear deck. It opened rearwards and let the canvas top unfold and close to the windshield's rim, at the front, in an elegant move. By creating the open-top version of the Roma, Ferrari had to rearrange the car's interior but still kept the 2+2 seat layout. The sports seats at the front were leather-wrapped, and the same materials were used for the rear seats. The automaker used the same 16"" screen for the instrument panel and the 8.4"" vertical touchscreen for the infotainment system, allowing wireless connection to Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The Roma Spider carried over the same 3.9-liter V8 turbocharged engine from its hardtop sibling.  That provided 620 PS (612 hp) sent to the rear wheels via an eight-speed automatic (dual-clutch) transmission.",FERRARI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Roma Spider"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""Grand touring"",  ""overall-design"": [""elegant"", ""dynamic"", ""seamless"", ""flawless"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""foldable""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""leather-wrapped""],    ""roof"": [""folding"", ""integrated""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""turbocharged""]  }}```"
FERRARI Roma,"In 2019, Ferrari introduced a new base model in its lineup, namely the Roma, and built it on the same platform and with the same 3.9-liter turbocharged V8 as the Portofino, but with a completely different interior. The Italian automaker had a weak spot for mid-front mounted engines, reserving the mid-ship solutions only for the fastest ones in its lineup. But even if the Roma was the entry-level Ferrari, that didn’t mean that it was slow. It was very fast and could carry four people inside its cabin. In addition, the automaker’s design studio, led by Flavio Manzoni, created a gran touring shape for the car. Furthermore, the Roma boasted a high level of technology, making a complete package for its customers that included not just a beautiful shape but also an advanced platform in all areas. From the outside, the long and low nose of the vehicle started with a set of LED headlights that were flush with the curved shapes of the front fenders. The daytime running lights created the illusion of splitting the headlamps into an upper and a lower side. The bumper sported the main grille where the carmaker’s badge took center stage. In addition, in the apron, Ferrari installed a second, broad grille and a splitter underneath it. From its profile, the cab-rearward design was emphasized by the sloped-down roofline, which ended into a wide rear window. The enlarged rear quarter panels made the vehicle look muscular but elegant at the same time. Finally, the rear fascia featured a very complicated design, with a crease under the upper section and LED taillights. Under the bumper, the automaker installed a diffuser and two pairs of round exhausts on each side of the vehicle. Inside, Ferrari arranged a 2+2 cabin layout with two high-bolstered bucket seats at the front and a bench seat profiled for two behind them. The transmission tunnel split the cabin into two areas, crossing the cabin from front to back. Fronting the driver was a digital instrument cluster with a center-mounted tachometer flanked by additional screens for the onboard computer data, navigation, and media system. The driver fronted a flat-bottom steering wheel with two large paddle shifters for situations when they wanted to manually change gears. On the sloped center stack, the automaker placed the touchscreen for the HVAC system, while the center console housed the automatic transmission controls and a cup holder. In the back, there was hardly room for grown-ups, but those were fine for short jaunts. Underneath the hood, Ferrari installed a 3.9-liter turbocharged engine mated with an eight-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox that sent all the oomph to the rear wheels via an electronically-controlled limited-slip differential. The new gearbox was six kilos (13 lbs.) lighter than the seven-speed transmission offered on the Portofino.",FERRARI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Roma"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""Gran touring"",  ""overall-design"": [""fast"", ""muscular"", ""elegant"", ""sloped"", ""complicated""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""curved""],    ""grille"": [""main"", ""broad""],    ""hood"": [""long"", ""low""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""flush"", ""splitting""],    ""bumper"": [""sporty"", ""grille"", ""apron""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""2+2 layout""],    ""roof"": [""sloped-down""],    ""diffusor"": [""complicated""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""round""]  }}```"
FERRARI GTC4Lusso,"Ferrari doesn't mess too much about mid-life cycle facelifts. It changes the model that much that it can be renamed. For instance, how many know that the 430 was actually a facelifted 360? So, in 2014 the FF model was replaced by the GTC4Lusso. The only body part that was kept from the FF was the windshield. Everything else was changed. Inside, Ferrari showed that it ditched the 2000's look and adopted a modern approach. It looks like there are two cockpits separated by a large central console, defined by the air-vents. The GTC4Lusso has an HD 10.25-inch touchscreen, a 1.5 GHz CPU and the sort of responsive, interactive usability a lot of cars could only dream about. It’s also nice how Ferrari has designed the dashboard to wrap around it so it’s fully integrated rather than stand-proud. And, most important, the passenger next to the driver has its own display dedicated to the audio system. Think like the driver has a personal DJ on the road. Finally, the tech upgrade is huge and it starts with a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox, dual-coil adaptive dampers and the 9th generation ESP. The AWD system was upgraded too. Last, but not least, the four-wheel steering is new and brings more handling in the parking lot. Since it is a 4.9-meter (16 ft) long vehicle, it is a feature more than welcome.",FERRARI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""GTC4Lusso"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": ""4.9-meter"",  ""overall-design"": [""modern"", ""integrated"", ""responsive"", ""sleek"", ""upgraded""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""kept""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FERRARI SF90,"Ferrari unveiled during a private event held on their home track at Fiorano the SF90 XX in both versions: the Stradale, which is the coupe, and the Spider, which is the open-top version of it. The new model comes as an addition to the SF90 lineup and is aimed at those who are spending some time on a track, not just on regular roads. The car was developed under the XX Programme, previously focused only on vehicles built for race tracks. But then, the program evolved and started to enhance production models, such as the Ferrari FXX-K EVO. Nevertheless, the team noticed that its customers started to ask for road-legal high-performance vehicles, so it came up with this: the SF90 XX Stradale. A 799-unit production for a high-performance vehicle made for tracks, but able to wear license plates on it. The team started off with a production SF90, which they enhanced it in all areas. As a result, the SF90 XX Stradale features a new nose fitted with a wider and lower splitter. In addition, the Z-shaped LED headlights were connected on their lower side with a pair of air intakes made to cool the front brakes. On the upper side of the front fenders, Ferrari installed a set of vents to enhance the car's aerodynamic shape. Moving on to the sides, there are new carbon fiber side skirts that are extended on the rear quarter panels. In addition, there are air intakes on both sides of the greenhouse, but those are needed to cool the engine. Last but not least, Ferrari installed a rear wing supported by two goose-neck-style struts. Inside, everything is designed around the driver. Ferrari installed a pair of sports seats with high bolstered areas. Despite the fact that they looked like unadjustable racing ones, they could recline. Between them, the car manufacturer installed a light center tunnel where the buttons for the gear selector were placed but were moved forward compared to the SF90. The cockpit also featured a simple-looking dashboard that Ferrari covered in Alcantara on the upper side to reduce glare, while the lower side was cushioned with fabric for a softer touch. Ferrari installed a plug-in hybrid system for the vehicle that featured a twin-turbo V8 internal combustion engine helped by three electric motors. As a result, the combined power of these elements reached 1030 PS (1016 HP). The ICE alone provided 797 of them, while the rest was ensured by the electric motors. Since Ferrari developed the car as a plug-in hybrid, it also ensured a large enough battery pack that allowed the vehicle to run for up to 25 km (15.5 miles) in EV mode at speeds of up to 135 kph (84 mph).",FERRARI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""SF90 XX"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""high-performance"", ""aerodynamic"", ""track-focused"", ""road-legal"", ""plug-in hybrid""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""wider"", ""lower""],    ""headlights"": [""Z-shaped LED""],    ""bumper"": [""air intakes""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""carbon fiber side skirts""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""rear wing""],    ""exhaust"": [""twin-turbo V8""]  }}```"
FIAT 500 Abarth,"While its electric-powered cousin Fiat 500 conquered the hearts and money of the eco-friendly vehicles buyers, the Abarth 595 version pushed the boundaries of its internal combustion unit. As part of the Fiat Group, Abarth built its vehicles differently, where the performance factor stood on top of anything else. However, unlike AMG, it didn't focus on luxurious items but turned its attention towards design, technical packages, and a sporty ambiance, even in the small Fiat 500 series. The Abarth 595 featured a different front fascia than the electric-powered 500. It still sported the round headlights and elliptic lamps underneath them. Still, it sported a functional grille on the lower part of the front bumper, needed to cool the internal combustion engine. It sat between the small, round fog lights. From its sides, the 595 featured 17"" light-alloy wheels, while in the back, the carmaker installed a quad exhaust system with twin pipes on each side. Inside, the car received a mild upgrade with a leather steering wheel and leather Abarth sports seats complemented with black design cues. In addition, the carmaker applied a matte black frame on the 7"" HD Uconnect infotainment system, and the same color adorned the dashboard. But the essential part of any Abarth was under the skin. The 1.4-liter turbocharged engine came from Formula 4 and provided enough grunt for the car to reach a top speed of 135 mph (217 kph) and the 0 to 62 mph (0-100 kph) time in just 7.3 seconds. So along with the stiff suspension and the big brakes kit, it transformed the Abarth 595 into a fun car on tight race tracks.",FIAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Abarth 595"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""functional"", ""aggressive"", ""compact""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""functional""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""round""],    ""bumper"": [""front""],    ""wheel"": [""17-inch"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""quad"", ""twin pipes""]  }}```"
FIAT 500X,"Fiat refreshed the 500 X urban crossover lineup in 2018, improving and adapting the vehicle to newer European emission standards, and also upgraded the car's exterior and interior. Those looking for a stylish B-segment crossover had many options to choose from, but the 500 X was focused more on the design than most of its competitors. As a result, despite its drawbacks on the interior, it provided many features that made its owners' lives easier thanks to some clever solutions and, most importantly, a better-looking vehicle. Fiat didn't want to sell a car that looked just like any other grocery-getter on the market. Furthermore, it still had the flavor of the successful 500 lineup. From the outside, the new and improved 500 X featured full-LED headlights that promised to fix the nighttime driving problems that the previous version had. Its daytime running lights were integrated inside the headlamps and mimicked the look of those installed in the regular 500. To create a powerful image of a crossover, the 500 X sported a front bumper adorned on its lower side by a light-gray plastic shield, which was mostly good for grass, not for bushes or rocks. From its profile, the 2019 model featured contrasting door handles and integrated blinkers into the door mirror caps. The greenhouse was tall enough to provide enough headroom for adult-sized passengers. Finally, at the back, a raked-forward tailgate ended the vehicle in a stylish way, similar to its 500 sibling. Moving onto the interior, customers were greeted by high-mounted front seats with mild bolstering. Those were mostly designed for comfort, the lack of tall sides easing the ingress and egress to the car. Still, those who wanted to feel hugged by the seats could get an optional set to satisfy their tastes. Fronting the driver was a unique-looking instrument cluster. The analog speedometer and the tachometer had their own individual scoops, while between them, Fiat squeezed another cluster filled with a 3.5"" TFT that showed information from the car's onboard computer. Atop the center stack, Fiat installed a touchscreen that featured Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, both wirelessly. In the back, access was easy thanks to the rear doors, and there was just enough room for a couple of passengers, although a third, middle-seated one, could suffer on long trips. Under the car's skin, Fiat installed a wide choice of drivetrains and engines. Unlike many of its competitors, who didn't offer AWD versions, the 500 X had that on the options list. The engine choice was surprisingly big for this segment, ranging between a 95 PS (94 hp) turbo diesel and a 150 PS (148 hp) turbocharged gasoline powerplant. All the oomph was sent to the front or in both axles, depending on the version.",FIAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""500 X"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""B-segment"",  ""overall-design"": [""stylish"", ""unique"", ""tall"", ""raked-forward"", ""wide choice""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""tall""],    ""grille"": [""adorned"", ""stylish""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""full-LED"", ""integrated"", ""stylish""],    ""bumper"": [""front"", ""adorned"", ""light-gray""],    ""wheel"": [""contrasting""],    ""doors"": [""integrated"", ""easy access""],    ""roof"": [""raked-forward"", ""stylish""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FIAT 500,"The Fiat 500 is not a car anymore. It is an icon of the European automotive industry, the car that helped Italy to grow more than six decades ago. The original design was re-mastered and, just like a black&white classic movie when it is colorized, the 500 was reinvented and brought back to the main automotive scene in 2007. Nowadays, the electric motor is the only one available on the little Italian car. The 500 dropped its internal combustion engines and adopted an 87 kW electric motor, which is fed from a 42 kWh lithium-ion battery. The plug is in the rear side of the vehicle and the battery ensures a range of up to 320 km in the WLTP cycle. This power unit is enough for a 0 to 100 kph (0-62 mph) sprint in 9 seconds flat and a 0 to 50 kph (0-31 mph) acceleration time of just 3.1 seconds. The top speed is limited to 130 kph (93.2 mph). Inside the vehicle there are a lot of recycled materials, since the Fiat 500 has also become a statement of sustainability. A 7” TFT plays the dashboard role and works together with a 10.25” Touch Screen infotainment display. The vehicle has multiple ways of charging and it comes as standard with a charging device, which can be plugged-in at home or in any regular 220v socket. An optional charging wall-box is provided for faster charging. In fast-charge mode, at public charging stations, it can be charged up to 80% in 35 minutes.",FIAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Fiat 500"",  ""year"": ""2007"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""iconic"", ""reinvented"", ""sustainable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""re-mastered""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FIAT Doblo,"The facelifted version of the Fiat Doblo was introduced in 2015 at the Geneva Motor Show. Despite being a utility van, it was factory built as an MPV as well. In 2000, Fiat decided to build a utility vehicle that could cover most of the urban needs for a small shop. It was a huge success and, in 2010, it introduced the second generation. It was offered in a few sizes, to fit everyone's needs and pockets. The 2015 Doblo MPV was more about sense than styling. It was a very practical vehicle, easy to drive, with great visibility and a huge luggage area. But the styling was not completely removed from the equation. Its new, swept-back headlights, the ascending beltline for the windows, and the tall greenhouse were specific for its class. The flared wheel-arches created a sportier look, even though it was not quite a sporty vehicle. In the back, the Doblo was available with either a liftgate or two half-doors. Inside, the Doblo MPV featured a dashboard that resembled most of the van's version, but with new additions. The steering wheel was different and an infotainment system with a 5” touch-screen was installed. Depending on the version, the car was available with up to seven seats. The last two were placed in the trunk area and could have been removed and left in the garage to increase the trunk space. For the drivetrain, the Doblo MPV was fitted with a choice of gasoline and diesel engines. On specific markets it was available with CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) as well. The manual gearbox was the only option for most of the versions. Only the 1.6-liter 90 hp was available with a 5-speed automatic.",FIAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Fiat Doblo"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""Utility van, MPV"",  ""overall-design"": [""practical"", ""swept-back headlights"", ""flared wheel-arches"", ""tall greenhouse"", ""ascending beltline""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""great visibility""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""flared wheel-arches""],    ""doors"": [""two half-doors""],    ""roof"": [""tall greenhouse""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FIAT Panda 4X4,"Fiat introduced the third generation of the Panda 4x4 at the Paris Motor Show in 2012. It was the only all-wheel-drive vehicle in its segment. The Italian carmaker introduced the Panda lineup in 1980, but it wasn't until 1986 when it launched the 4x4 version for its small-class vehicle. That version proved successful, and the carmaker decided to introduce all-wheel-drive Pandas to the following generations. That said, in 2012, the third generation of the all-wheel-drive Panda was ready to face the snow and tracks. Fiat built the Panda 4x4 on the same platform as the 500 and the Panda. Unlike its siblings, it featured a higher ground clearance and specific design parts, such as the black underbody protection on the front bumper and the plastic moldings on its sides. The designer continued the same theme on the rear bumper. A silver plastic shield was introduced on the car's bottom to further enhance the car's off-road ability. Inside, the design was modified when compared to the 4x2 versions. It featured a new green fascia variant around the instrument cluster. The car featured specific fabric seats with a special design and eco-leather details. A high console over the central tunnel added a further storage compartment to the 14 already present on 4x2 versions. The technical side was the most important part of the little Panda 4x4. Its all-wheel-drive system was based on a Haldex center differential and the ESP system, which braked the wheels without traction and sent the torque to those with a better grip. The gasoline engined vehicles featured a very low range first gear so the car could cope better with steep ramps.",FIAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Panda 4x4"",  ""year"": ""2012"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""off-road"", ""rugged"", ""compact"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""specific design parts""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""black underbody protection"", ""plastic moldings"", ""silver plastic shield""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""specific fabric seats"", ""eco-leather details""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FIAT Panda,"The Fiat’s success with the Panda started back in 1980 and since then, the company produced over 2 million Pandas and the number kept growing with every new generation. In 2011, Fiat decided to revive the Panda and give it a more mature look, but with the same versatility displayed by the previous models. Fiat has thus launched a replacement in the form of the new Panda, which made its debut at this year’s Frankfurt Auto Show. The Panda was offered with 3 engine options: a 0.9-liter aspirated TwinAir developing 65 hp, a 1.2-liter Fire Evo II (optimized valve timing at all engine speed and ensure higher torque) with 69 hp and a 1.3-liter Multijet with 75 hp. The gasoline engines and the 1.3-liter multijet offered a Start&Stop system as standard, which reduced the fuel consumption and the CO2 emissions. Even if the Panda was a small car, its trunk was still very spacious and could comfortably accommodate 5 people. The load area could go up to 260 liters with the rear seats folded. Another smart thing was the thin front seats that ensure enough legroom for the rear seats passengers. At the launch, the Panda was offered with a two-wheel-drive, however, later on, a Panda 4x4 was presented to the public.",FIAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Panda"",  ""year"": ""2011"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""mature"", ""versatile"", ""spacious"", ""smart""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""thin front seats""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FIAT 600,"One of the most successful cars in Fiat's history was the 500, a model that received many upgrades along its lifespan. Moreover, that little car paved the way for new vehicles that evolved from it, including its bigger sibling, the 600. Furthermore, both cars shared the same platform, including one powered by electrons, not by gasoline or diesel. To keep the car's price low, the automaker offered the 600e in just two versions: red and La Prima. Customers asked for more crossovers, and Fiat thought about how to answer that request better, and the answer, in 2023, was the 600e. While the automaker made it to fit in the B-segment, the higher ground clearance and some of its details pushed it into the crossover area. Yet, it was mainly created to tackle cobblestone roads, pavement, and curbs. It was not the car someone would choose to go in the woods. The 600e featured a front fascia that resembled the same look as its smaller sibling, the 500e. Its LD headlights sported a half-circle design. They flanked the main grille, which was mostly blocked, and on the lower bumper, the designers placed a mesh grille with a squares-pattern look. From its profile, the five-door hatchback 600e boasted black plastic moldings around the wheel arches that matched the black matte side sills. Fiat offered the vehicle with up to 18"" light-alloy wheels that created a powerful image for the little vehicle. At the back, the raked-forward tailgate was available with either a manual opening or a hands-free power one. As a final exterior detail, the 600e sported the nameplate embossed in the rear bumper adorned by the Italian flag. Inside, Fiat created a cozy cabin fitted with ivory manmade leather that sported the carmaker's logo embroidered on them. Unusually for a car from this segment, customers could order the vehicle with back-massage seats and three heating levels. A 7"" digital instrument cluster showed information about the car's function, while a 10.25"" touchscreen had its place atop the center stack. In the back, there was enough room for three passengers on short jaunts that could fill the 60/40 split-folding bench seat. Fiat knew its customers, and that's why it tried to provide the car with enough storage areas that could hold up to 15 liters (0.5 cu-ft) of various small-sized items. At the back, the trunk could accommodate up to 385 liters (13.6 cu-ft) of space. Fiat took the safety assistance systems very seriously, so it fitted the 600e with all the technology an urban driver would need. As a result, there was a radar behind the front bumper, in the middle of the lower grille, that helped with the adaptive cruise control or the automatic emergency braking system. For the drivetrain, Fiat offered just one choice: a 115 kW (156 HP) motor fueled by a 54 kWh battery pack.",FIAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Fiat 600e"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""B-segment"",  ""overall-design"": [""cozy"", ""modern"", ""urban"", ""sleek"", ""compact""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""blocked"", ""squares-pattern""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LD"", ""half-circle""],    ""bumper"": [""lower mesh grille""],    ""wheel"": [""up to 18\"" light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [""five-door hatchback""],    ""roof"": [""raked-forward tailgate""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""rear bumper embossed""]  }}```"
FIAT Tipo 5 Doors,"Fiat revived the Tipo nameplate in 2015 by creating a new vehicle in three shapes: sedan, station wagon, and hatchback, and all of them were built on a budget in Turkey. Fiat's financial status was not on the bright side of the balance anymore, and the Italian carmaker needed a solution to sell more cars, and it needed it fast. Also, it needed solutions to build this car on a budget and sell it with a profit even though it was affordable. But since we're talking about Fiat, they found a way to do that. The hatchback was not the first to reach the assembly lines in Turkey. It came second and featured the same front fascia as its three-box sibling. Regardless of the car's qualities, it was well designed, with angry-looking headlights that flanked a chromed mesh grille which, in turn, supported the Fiat badge in the middle. It shared the same A- and B-pillars with the sedan and the station wagon, but from there on, there was a significant difference at the C-pillar, which concluded the greenhouse's shape at the back, supporting the tailgate. Moreover, all versions received a roof spoiler with integrated third brake light. Inside, Fiat installed the same dashboard as in the station wagon, with a larger infotainment screen than in the sedan, and that was an option. But the customers shouldn't expect a high-quality interior or leather seats. Also, it shared the same rear bench with the station wagon, which expanded the otherwise small trunk. Fiat didn't want to invest too much in this project built atop an existing platform and installed already developed diesel and gasoline engines.",FIAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Tipo"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""budget-friendly"", ""well-proportioned"", ""angry-looking"", ""integrated"", ""practical""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""chromed"", ""mesh""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angry-looking""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""integrated"", ""spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FIAT 124 Spider,"The most sold roadster in the world received an Italian heart and a different face that transformed it from a Mazda MX5/Miata into a Fiat 124 Abarth. The Mazda MX5/Miata was a long time champion as the most sold roadster in the world, long time after the original Fiat 124 Abarth was a glorious name on the car arena. Fiat and Mazda joined their forces and developed a car that could have been offered as an MX5 or as a 124 Abarth. It was something more than just a badge-engineering. From the exterior, the round headlights and wide grille resembled the original Fiat 124 Spider from 1966 styled by Pininfarina. The classic look of the car was different than the one on the Miata, which was styled by Masashi Nakayama. The low beltline and the almost vertical A-pillars gave the car a simple, clean aspect. In the back, the 124 GT Abarth featured four exhausts on the sides and a diffuser under the bumper. Inside, the Italian cousin of the MX5 featured Recaro sport-bucket seats, but most of the interior was carried-over from the Japanese model. Both cars were built in Japan, in a Mazda factory. The instrument cluster was slightly different, with a big and red tachometer in the middle. The car didn't feature a power-roof. It was manual, but it needed less than 5 seconds to open or close it. Under the hood, the Fiat 124 GT Abarth featured a different engine than the Japanese version. It featured a 1.4-liter turbocharged engine and it produced more torque and more power than the MX5. Moreover, the gearbox was different, even though it was a 6-speed as well.",FIAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Fiat 124 Abarth"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""Italian"", ""classic"", ""clean"", ""sporty"", ""powerful""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""simple"", ""clean""],    ""grille"": [""wide"", ""round""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""round""],    ""bumper"": [""diffuser"", ""four exhausts""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""manual"", ""quick""],    ""diffusor"": [""under the bumper""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""four on the sides""]  }}```"
FIAT Topolino,"The Topolino is a legendary nameplate in Fiat's history, credited by many as the car that saved the Italian brand after World War II. As a result, the carmaker considered bringing it back on the market as an EV in 2023. Just like the 500 Topolino that Fiat made between 1936 and 1955 in more than 500,000 units, the 2023 Topolino was affordable, practical, and easy to use by anyone. In addition, in selected countries, the vehicle could be rented and driven even by people who didn't have a driving license. Being part of a big automotive group such as Stellantis came with its perks, and one of them was the advantage of shared technology. The micro-vehicle was a badge-engineered Citroen Ami or Opel Rocks. It was not even considered an actual car but an electric quadricycle aimed at customers who needed affordable transportation inside cities. It took the concept of building cheaply at a higher level. Innovative engineering and planning allowed the automaker to create the Topolino/Ami/Rocks with fewer body parts than a regular one. For instance, both doors were molded in the same press. That's why one was hinged at the front while the other was in the back. But Fiat adapted the vehicle's look according to its design language. As a result, the front fascia resembled the old Fiat 500 from the '50s, featuring round headlights and a silver bumper. At the back, the quadricycle had a panel that sported vertical taillights and, as an option, an external rack for a suitcase. But the Italian automaker went even further with personalizing the vehicle. Apart from the canvas folding roof, it offered the possibility to drive the Topolino with the doors removed and passengers secured just by the seat belts and a rope hung between the A- and B-pillars. Worth mentioning that all body panels were made out of composite materials. The Topolino offered room for two occupants, just like its French and German siblings. Unlike those, it featured padded plastic seats. In front of the driver, the Italian automaker installed a small digital display fitted into a cluster resembling the 1957 Fiat 500 dashboard's design. In addition, customers could install a speaker or a fan plugged-in into a USB socket. There was no infotainment system in the vehicle. Still, customers could use their smartphones along with a dedicated app for that. It could've been connected via the same USB port for accessing more data provided by the quadricycle's onboard computer. The electric quadricycle was a European vehicle category that allowed anyone over 14 years old to drive them on public roads. In addition, these vehicles had a capped maximum speed of 45 kph (28 mph). Thanks to its 6 kW (8HP) motor, the Topolino had no problem reaching that speed. The battery pack provided 5.5 kWh of energy, enough to provide a range of up to 75 km (47 miles).",FIAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Topolino"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""micro-vehicle"",  ""overall-design"": [""affordable"", ""practical"", ""city-friendly"", ""innovative"", ""personalized""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""molded"", ""compact""],    ""headlights"": [""round""],    ""bumper"": [""silver""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""molded"", ""removable""],    ""roof"": [""canvas folding""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FIAT 500L Trekking,"The Fiat 500L Trekking is a roomy and practical vehicle that provides comfortable seating for five people and ample storage space for their belongings, including five suitcases in its 400-liter boot. Its design incorporates extensive glazing and split windscreen pillars, ensuring exceptional visibility with a nearly 360-degree vision for the driver. EuroNCAP has recognized the 500L's safety features by awarding it a five-star rating. There are four powertrain options: two gasoline engines and two diesel engines. The petrol lineup includes the 0.9-liter TwinAir Turbo engine with 105 hp and the 1.4-liter FIRE engine with 95 hp. For diesel variants, there is a 1.3-liter engine with 85 hp or a 1.6-liter engine with 105 hp. All engines, except the 1.4-liter one, come equipped with Start & Stop technology. Setting a precedent for Fiat, the 500L Trekking comes standard with City Brake Control, a system designed to prevent or minimize damage during low-speed collisions. Additionally, it comes equipped with Traction+, an electronic system that emulates the behavior of a self-locking differential, enabling the front-wheel drive car to handle challenging terrains. The exterior design of the 500L Trekking exudes a sporty and dynamic character, featuring specially crafted bumpers, underbody protection, and satin-finish inserts, as the Fiat 500L Trekking is designed to excel in off-road conditions, featuring specially designed bumpers, protective shields, and increased ride height. The vehicle sits 10% higher than the regular 500L, providing a ground clearance of 5.7 inches, and is fitted with M+S all-season tires to ensure enough grip in all kinds of situations. Inside, the 500L Trekking offers a high level of standard equipment, including a 5-inch touchscreen radio with Bluetooth. There are also a lot of optional upgrades when it comes to the interior, ranging from a digital radio and satellite navigation to a premium Beats sound system. The interior of the 500L Trekking combines functionality and flexibility with a sliding 60/40 split rear seat that accommodates three passengers. The clever Fold & Tumble function allows for a flat load space from the tailgate to the front seats, enabling the transportation of loads up to 7.8 feet long. Rear parking sensors are included as a standard feature. For the car to offer an authentic Italian feeling like other variations of the Fiat 500L, the 500L Trekking provides the option to have a fully integrated espresso coffee machine in the center console. In collaboration with Lavazza, Fiat has developed a special platform that enables the installation of the coffee maker within the passenger compartment. Overall, the Fiat 500L Trekking offers a stylish, attractive, and versatile package that combines practicality, safety, and off-road capability. It provides various customization options and accessories to suit individual preferences and offers unique driving experiences.",FIAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Fiat 500L Trekking"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""roomy, spacious"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""dynamic"", ""versatile"", ""stylish"", ""attractive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""extensive glazing"", ""split pillars""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""specially crafted"", ""off-road design""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FIAT 500 3+1,"The Fiat 500 saga continued with the introduction of a new model in 2020. It was a bold move that offered easier access to the rear seats. The 500 might be one of the biggest success stories in Fiat's history. It was the car that saved the Italian carmaker from bankruptcy and the foundation of its evolution. After it switched to an all-electric drivetrain, the bodywork needed some transformations to be a better daily driver in the city or as a commuter vehicle. At a glance, some might say that there were no modifications to the vehicle. In the front lower bumper, there was a mesh that provided air to cool the AC condenser and the batteries. The standard full-LED headlights were half-round with ""eyebrows"" on the hood. A pair of circles for the daytime running lights decorated the bumper's upper corners. In the back, the car marked the return of full-size taillights. Previously it featured only a lit rim. They were full-LED as well. The most significant difference was on the passenger side, where there were a door and a half. The rear one was rear-hinged (suicidal door) and provided easier access for the bench. It was okay if there was a baby strapped in a child seat in the back. Moreover, there was no B-pillar between the A- and C-pillars. The instrument panel was a 7"" TFT display while the infotainment UConnect system featured a wide, 10.25"" touch-screen. For the drivetrain, the 500 3+1 featured a 70 kW electric motor fed by a 23.8 kWh battery pack. It could drive up to 240 km (150 miles) in the city, with 180 km (112 miles) range in a complete NEDC cycle.",FIAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Fiat 500"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""bold"", ""electric"", ""modern"", ""city-friendly"", ""innovative""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""mesh""],    ""hood"": [""half-round"", ""with 'eyebrows'""],    ""headlights"": [""full-LED"", ""half-round""],    ""bumper"": [""decorated with circles"", ""lower with mesh""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""rear-hinged (suicidal)"", ""no B-pillar""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FIAT Panda Cross,"Fiat introduced a new version of its small-sized crossover Panda 4x4 in 2014, adding more rugged elements to the vehicle and making it more off-road capable. The Italian automaker offered a 4x4 version of the Panda on the first generation in 1983, and owners loved it. Thus, Fiat helped Italians and many other European customers to enjoy a day at a picnic without the fear of getting stuck on some fields or at a campsite. The idea was carried over to the third generation of this nameplate. But the look didn't exactly match the car's possibilities. So Italians made it look even tougher and renamed it Panda Cross. At the front, the car boasted a new bumper fitted with a large skid plate at the bottom to protect the engine and transmission and flanked it with unpainted plastic elements. Above them, the headlights, fog lamps, and LED daytime running lights were well protected against grass and bushes. But Fiat didn't stop there and added additional protection on the lower side of the doors and the side sills. Combined with a high ground clearance of 16 cm (6.3 inches) and 185/65R15 tires (larger than on the Panda 4x4), the Cross showed more muscle for an off-road trip. Finally, at the back, another underbody shield protected the rear bumper from scratches and hits. Inside, the automaker didn't make too many changes but worked on those that mattered most. Thus, the front seats boasted brown eco-leather bolstered areas that matched the door cards' trims. In addition, the seatbacks were adorned with the ""Cross"" wording embroidered. Fiat added a new copper color on the dashboard and the center consoleand satin titanium finish. Although not a hard-core off-road machine, the Panda Cross featured an all-wheel drive system with electronic controls for the center differential. Furthermore, the 24° (approach), 33° (departure), 20° (ramp break over) angles, and 31.5° (70%) climb gradient allowed it to perform far better than many other heavier crossovers.",FIAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Panda"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""tough"", ""muscular"", ""off-road capable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""tough"", ""protective""],    ""headlights"": [""well-protected""],    ""bumper"": [""new"", ""fitted with skid plate"", ""unpainted plastic elements"", ""additional protection""],    ""wheel"": [""high ground clearance"", ""185/65R15 tires""],    ""doors"": [""additional protection on lower side"", ""brown eco-leather bolstered areas""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FIAT 500L Urban,"While the reintroduction of the Fiat 500 on the market was a real success, the 2-door Fiat 500 was a little too small to carry rear passengers and cargo. With the desire of attracting even more buyers, Fiat decided it was time to design a bigger Fiat 500, while still keeping some of the already iconic look. The larger four-door Fiat 500 L provided more than 60cm of added length, plus the extra doors. The interior space could be compared to a small’s crossover. The standard features available for the Fiat 500L brought antilock disc brakes, traction and stability control, hill-assist, a rear-view camera along with rear parking sensors. An optional smart feature was the Uconnect Access that came with a 6.5-inch touchscreen. It also included remote vehicle access with emergency assistance and stolen vehicle location. The 500L was offered in 3 trim levels: Pop, Trekking and Lounge. The basic Pop was well equipped with 16-inch alloys, tinted glass, daytime running lights, adjustable front seats, Bluetooth phone connectivity, a 5-inch touchscreen display and many others. The Trekking trim level came with bigger 17-inch alloys, foglight, leather upholstery, heated front seats and a better audio system with a subwoofer included. The top of the range added chrome exterior mirrors and body accents, as well as the same 17-inch alloys but this time, with a painted finish. Stand-alone options such as a sunroof, a matte black finish wheels were available as well.",FIAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Fiat 500L"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""larger four-door"",  ""overall-design"": [""iconic look"", ""crossover interior space""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""daytime running lights"", ""foglight""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""16-inch alloys"", ""17-inch alloys"", ""painted finish"", ""matte black finish wheels""],    ""doors"": [""two extra doors""],    ""roof"": [""sunroof""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FIAT Panda City Cross,"Fiat introduced the City Cross version of the Panda in 2017, offering it as a crossover with either front- or all-wheel drive system. Ever since the first Panda generation, the small Italian hatchback was offered a 4x4 version. While in the '80s, that was needed to access country roads and muddy terrains, things changed over time. In 2017, small-sized crossovers were mainly used inside cities and didn't even require all-wheel drive systems. In addition, customers asked for off-road-looking vehicles not to drive them through the woods but to crawl above a curb in a parking lot. And that's exactly what Fiat understood and provided. Thus, the Panda City Cross featured plastic cladding around the vehicle, with an oversized bumper up front that mimicked an underbody shield. A pair of small, round fog lamps were fitted next to the headlights on their inner side. The higher ground clearance was emphasized by additional side sills and fender trims. Inside the cabin, Fiat installed hard plastic trims, easy to wash. It was a great idea since those pieces were far cheaper than soft ones, although they didn't look bad at all in a crossover. The high-mounted front seats didn't provide any side bolstering, but they were designed for urban comfort. In addition, that solution allowed the passengers seated in the back to slip their feet underneath the front seats. The rear bench featured a 60/40 split-folding system, increasing the otherwise tiny trunk. Under the hood, Fiat installed a 1.2-liter turbocharged gasoline engine. Depending on the market, Fiat offered it with either front- or all-wheel-drive system.",FIAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Panda City Cross"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""crossover"", ""urban"", ""off-road"", ""plastic cladding"", ""high ground clearance""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""oversized""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""small"", ""round""],    ""bumper"": [""oversized""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""turbocharged""]  }}```"
FIAT Tipo Cross,"Fiat refreshed the Tipo lineup and, along with other improvements on the drivetrain, introduced a new crossover version named Tipo Cross. The Italian carmaker introduced the new generation of Tipo in 2015 as a successor for the Bravo and Linea models. It was built as an economy vehicle, with a low price and low maintenance costs, using a new platform. It was offered in three body versions: sedan, hatchback, and station wagon. The Tipo lineup was refreshed in 2020. The facelifted model featured full-LED headlights and taillights on the Tipo Cross version. The manufacturer also installed brushed chrome elements in the lower section of the car. A pair of 16"" light-alloy wheels was offered as standard while a 17"" was on the options list. Fiat offered the Tipo Cross only as a hatchback. Together with a 4 cm (1.6"") raise in the ground clearance due to the new suspension, Tipo Cross offered a more adventurous look to travel well on unpaved roads. Fiat Tipo was often criticized for its bland interior, which offered an infotainment system with a screen smaller than most smartphones on the market. So, the Italians made a big improvement on the car's dashboard. A 7"" TFT screen replaced the conventional, analog dials, and on the center stack, Fiat installed a 10.25"" touch-screen display. Under the hood, Fiat installed new engines that complied with the Euro 6d regulations, which were due to become mandatory from January 2021. The new, 1.0-liter gasoline engine was a three-pot unit that offered higher torque at lower revs than its 1.4-liter naturally aspirated unit, which it replaced. Fiat installed a revised version of its already known 1.6-liter unit for the diesel versions but upgraded to 130 hp for the top version.",FIAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Tipo Cross"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""economical"", ""modern"", ""adventurous""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""brushed chrome""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""full-LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""16\"" light-alloy"", ""17\"" optional""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FIAT Tipo,"The name Tipo returned after two decades of absence on the market and it evolved to a compact sedan, but it was built on a small-segment car platform, from the Fiat 500 L. The compact sedan market in some parts of Europe was highly contested by more car-makers. Fiat understood that it can get a big piece of pie there and it started to work on a car that would fit the needs and exceed some expectations. The Fiat Tipo was offered in three body versions: sedan, hatchback, and station-wagon. The most important version was the sedan, which was launched in 2015 at the Istanbul Motor Show. In the small-segment, most of the cars were designed without too much attention to the exterior look. But Fiat took a different approach. The narrow headlights, the 3D grille, and stylish look didn't offer the same cheap design feel like some of its competitors. Inside, there was a five-passenger interior, but the shoulder room in the back and the profiled floor didn't offer enough space for three adults. The dashboard was designed with nice forms, but the 5” infotainment screen was the biggest in the offer and it was smaller than most of the smartphones on the market. For the engine compartment, the Tipo was offered with a choice of two gasoline and two diesel versions, but only the 1.6-liter gasoline unit was available with an automatic gearbox as an option.",FIAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Tipo"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""compact sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""stylish"", ""compact"", ""elegant""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""narrow""],    ""grille"": [""3D""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""narrow""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""five-passenger""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""gasoline"", ""diesel""]  }}```"
FIAT Fullback,"Fiat tried to offer a wider range of utility vehicles for its customers, including a workhorse such as the Fullback pickup, available with an extended cab and a longer bed. The Italian carmaker needed an off-road pickup in its LCV lineup and the logical partner was the Mitsubishi. Previously, the Japanese carmaker worked closely with Dodge, which was now in a partnership with Fiat. After the paper were signed, a badge-engineered Mitsubishi L200 was introduced on the market as Fiat Fullback. It was available in a few body choices, including an extended-cab version. The main difference between the Fullback and the L200 was the badge and the front fascia. Fiat Fullback featured swept-back headlights and a mesh grille with a 3D pattern on it. The extended cab offered enough room in the back for two adults on short trips, such as from the storage area to the construction site, or to the stable to deliver hay for horses. Inside, the Fullback featured cloth upholstery for the base trim level, while the leather seats and aluminum inserts were fitted as standard on the upper trim levels. A big infotainment system, carried over from Mitsubishi, was fitted as an option. At least, the air-conditioning was standard. Fiat Professional was the Italian carmaker's utility vehicle arm, and its customers who already had LCV's from it asked for a reliable and trustworthy off-road vehicle. Fiat offered the Fullback. Under the hood, the pickup-truck featured a 2.4-liter turbodiesel engine for most of the markets, while in specific countries was available with a 2.3-liter gasoline unit. The standard transmission was a 6-speed manual, while a 5-speed automatic was on the options list.

FIAT 500e,"Fiat made the 2013 500e specifically for the U.S. market and even said that it had no intentions to sell that vehicle in Europe, leaving its fans at home, in Italy, with tears in their eyes. The 500 was so successful that the Italian automaker couldn’t replace it with anything else. Moreover, it expanded the range using the same nameplate and various letters behind it. While the L or X meant larger-sized vehicles, with a crossover stance or an MPV, respectively, the e stood for electric. Fiat made it on the same platform as the rest of the range to get some incentives from the U.S. government, and the recipe worked. Moreover, the final product was good enough, especially for those who needed a nice-looking tiny vehicle able to park anywhere but large enough to accommodate up to four people inside its cabin. Fiat used the same bodywork as the regular 500 series with internal combustion engines. But still, there were some slight differences that made the electric version stand apart from its gasoline-powered siblings. At the front, the automaker installed headlights with tiny little bezels surrounding the projector beam headlamp. Below the bumper, the 500e sported a different apron than its siblings. It featured a trapezoidal grille with an upper gap and round holes. The fog lamps were also included in this new part. Depending on the trim level, the car featured contrasting colors for the door mirror caps and the rear roof spoiler placed atop the tailgate. Inside, the automaker installed two bucket seats at the front and a bench for two in the back, but without too much legroom for those seated there. Still, it was enough for children. The main differences compared with the ICE-powered 500 were at the front. Fiat filled the instrument cluster with a color display that showed various information about the car’s status gathered from the onboard computer. Besides speed, it revealed energy consumption, range, and battery status. On the center stack, instead of the gear stick, the 500e featured a round panel with four buttons on it for driving programs. Despite the car’s small size, there were even two cup holders and a phone holder between the seats on the floor. As a final detail, the automaker proudly placed the 500e badge on the dash panel in front of the side passenger. Since Fiat transformed the 500 into an electric vehicle, it used the area under the hood to place the 111 hp (113 PS) electric motor that powered the front wheels. But the most impressive part of this electric drivetrain was the instant 148 lb-ft (201 Nm) of torque that moved the less-than-3,000 lbs. vehicle. Fiat installed a 24 kWh lithium-ion battery pack under the rear bench seat. As a result, the range was not great, and its 0 to 60 mph (0-97 kph) time of 8.2 seconds was not impressive. Still, it was enough for the urban environment, school runs, and some light shopping.",FIAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""500e"",  ""year"": ""2013"",  ""size"": ""tiny, small"",  ""overall-design"": [""electric"", ""compact"", ""urban-friendly"", ""stylish"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""trapezoidal"", ""round-holed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""projector beam"", ""tiny bezels""],    ""bumper"": [""different apron"", ""fog lamps""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""contrasting colors for door mirror caps""],    ""roof"": [""contrasting colors for rear roof spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""rear roof spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FIAT Tipo Station Wagon,"Fiat introduced a station wagon version for the re-born Tipo lineup in 2016 and brought more space into the budget-car segment. The Italian carmaker dug deep and retrieved the Tipo nameplate from its files in 2015, two decades after the last Tipo 1 rolled out from the assembly lines. Unlike its predecessor, it was a three-box sedan. The station wagon and the hatchback followed it in the following year. Fiat chose to build the car in Turkey to lower the manufacturing costs and compete against other budget cars from the market. While the European market was focused on crossovers and SUVs, a significant number of customers were more interested in econobox cars, such as the Tipo. The station-wagon shape offered bigger trunks than a regular, compact-segment hatchback, but at a lower price. At the front, it featured a 3D pattern for the grille and swept-back headlights. Up to the B-pillar, it shared the same panels as the sedan. The carmaker ended its extended roof towards the raked-forward D-pillars at the back. To ease the loading and unloading, Fiat installed a low and flat trunk sill. Inside, the carmaker installed an upgraded dashboard and, as an option, a larger screen for the infotainment unit compared to the sedan version. At the back, the Tipo station wagon offered 550 liters with the rear split-folding bench in an upright position. Under the hood, Fiat offered the Tipo with a choice of diesel and gasoline engines ranging between 95 hp and 120 hp.",FIAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Fiat Tipo Station Wagon"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""budget-friendly"", ""practical"", ""elegant""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""3D pattern"", ""swept-back""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""extended"", ""raked-forward""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FIAT 500L Living,"A well-thought combination of comfort, space and efficiency, the new 500L Living was designed for bigger families. While still keeping the iconic look of the Fiat 500, the 500L Living had rounder shapes and, of course, more space - it was longer than the 500 L with almost 20 cm. The 500L Living was designed with an extra 3rd row with 2 seats, suitable for children rather than adults. The trunk capacity was around 550 L and could be extended to a 1700 L with the 2nd and the 3rd row of seats folded, users being able to carry items longer than 250 cm. Considered to be the most compact 7-seater on the market, the 500L Living also offered great handling and agility. The Living was easy to park in tight spots and also dealt pretty well with corners. Both diesel and gasoline engines were offered for the 500L Living, 3 diesel options and one gasoline, with power ranging from 85 hp to 105 hp. The 500L Living came in 2 versions, the PopStar (5 seater) and the Lounge (7-seater). While the basic PopStar came with lots of features, the Lounger added dual-zone climate control, fog lights, chamois eco leather dashboard, 16-inch alloys, rain sensor and optional leather seats and ParkView rear camera with the Loft Pack included.",FIAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""500L Living"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""longer, spacious"",  ""overall-design"": [""iconic"", ""compact"", ""round""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FIAT Uno,"Fiat revived the Uno name for the South-American market, built it in its Brazilian factory, and marketed it as the ""Nuovo"" Uno since 2010. The Uno was introduced on the market in 1983, and it was a huge global success for the Italian carmaker. It was produced in Europe until 2002 in Fiat's Polish factory, but eventually, it was withdrawn and replaced by the Punto on the small segment. On the other hand, the Brazilians still missed it and asked Fiat the permission to revive the name. They even made the initial design sketches while the final details were made in Italy. Then, the production started in the Banta factory. While the car's overall look resembled more of a Panda than an Uno, the South-American customers were happy with the new car. It stood on the same platform as the trusted Fiat Palio, which was also successful on that market. Its swept-back headlights covered the hood and fenders' front upper corners while the almost completely masked grille sported three small vertical gaps. Its wrapped-around bumpers and the oversized wheel-arches made the car looks bigger than its 3.8 m (148"") length. Inside, the carmaker offered something for low-budget customers with a simple dashboard design. While the materials were not top-quality, the carmaker managed to offer a pair of cupholders and two airbags. On the upper trim levels, Fiat offered an air-conditioning system and power windows. For the rear seats, the carmaker installed a one-piece folding bench with a tilting system that allowed a 10 liters (0.3 cu-ft) trunk increase while still offering enough room for two passengers. Under the hood, the carmaker installed a choice of three gasoline engines when the production started, while Fiat offered a flex-fuel system later on.",FIAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Uno"",  ""year"": ""2010"",  ""size"": ""3.8 m (148\"") length"",  ""overall-design"": [""Panda-like look"", ""Oversized wheel-arches"", ""Simple dashboard design""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""Swept-back""],    ""grille"": [""Almost completely masked"", ""Sporting three small vertical gaps""],    ""hood"": [""Covered by headlights""],    ""headlights"": [""Swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [""Wrapped-around""],    ""wheel"": [""Oversized wheel-arches""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FISKER Ocean,"Fisker returned on the market with a brand new SUV in late 2021, after spending several years in financial struggles after the Fisker Karma vehicle. This time, it didn't return with a hybrid but with a full-electric SUV. Like the Karma, the Ocean is focused on design but with a few engineering marvels. At the front, the carmaker placed a large black grille with a hexagonal pattern on the apron, flanked by body-colored elements and the orange, boomerang-style turn signals. In the middle, the carmaker put the radar sensor for the automatic cruise control and the AEBS systems. Up above the bumper, the carmaker placed the car's model name, Ocean, in the middle, while on the sides, it installed the LED headlights. Those three elements were connected visually via a light strip. Unlike most electric cars on the market, the Ocean had the motor at the front. Thus, even though some thin lines were on the cover, it was not a regular opening hood. On the driver's side, there was the charging port on the front wheel fender. The tall, sculptured door panels raised on the rear side, above the rear wheel arch. A set of black fender-flares adorned the wheel fenders. The D-pillars featured a cutout as a design element at the back, while the tailgate featured an opening, drop-down window. Moving inside, the Ocean featured large seats and exclusive microfiber materials. The flat-bottom steering wheel stood in front of a TFT display placed in front of the driver. Fisker set a second touch-screen on the center stack for the infotainment system, lower than the instrument panel, and used recycled materials for the interior. A tall center console separated the front passengers.",FISKER,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ocean"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""electric"", ""sculptured"", ""exclusive"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""tall""],    ""grille"": [""large"", ""black"", ""hexagonal"", ""boomerang-style""],    ""hood"": [""sculptured""],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""body-colored""],    ""wheel"": [""front"", ""rear""],    ""doors"": [""tall"", ""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [""none""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Mustang Convertible,"Ever since the Mustang's first generation, Ford offered a drop-top version for this model, and in late 2022 it also brought the GT Convertible. The Mustang convertible was part of the pony car culture, and these open-top versions attracted thousands of customers ever since the 1964 ½ model year appeared on the market. Considering this, it was obvious that Ford wouldn't launch any new generation without a rag-top version. Thus, in 2022, along with the introduction of the Mustang's seventh sequel, it also created such a model. In addition, it also made it with a GT package. As expected, the front of the car retained the same design language shared with its GT coupe sibling, including the hood with the vents on it. Moreover, the front fascia retained the hexagonal-pattern mesh design for the upper and lower grilles and the side scoops. From its profile, the GT convertible revealed its thick A-pillars that also served as a safety arch. The cabin showed a completely different design than the sixth generation of the Mustang. For starters, the double-bubble dashboard design was replaced by a more conventional one. On the plus side, the analog instrument cluster was replaced by a 12.4"" wide TFT in front of the driver, continued by a 13.2"" touch-screen placed atop the center stack. All four seats featured bolstered areas. In the back, like in any other Mustang convertible, there was very limited legroom. Fortunately, thanks to the retractable roof concealed behind the cabin, the headroom was enough. For the powertrain, Ford chose the 5.0-liter Coyote engine as the sole option for the GT Convertible, which paired it with either a six-speed manual or a ten-speed automatic.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mustang"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""thick A-pillars"",  ""overall-design"": [""open-top"", ""hexagonal-pattern mesh design"", ""double-bubble dashboard replaced"", ""analog instrument cluster replaced"", ""bolstered seats""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""concealed retractable""],    ""grille"": [""hexagonal-pattern mesh""],    ""hood"": [""vented""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""retractable""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""5.0-liter Coyote engine""]  }}```"
FORD Everest,"One month after it introduced the Ranger, Ford brought the new generation of the Everest on the market, replacing its seven-year-old predecessor. Ford was highly successful with the previous generation of the Everest and followed the same recipe for the 2022 model. Thus, it carried over the chassis and the drivetrain from the Ranger and then added a modified bodywork on top of that. At the front, the 2022 Everest featured the same front fascia as its pickup sibling. Thus, it carried over the C-shaped daytime running lights and a massive grille adorned with chromed elements. In addition, the lower bumper sported a pair of fog lamps and two recovery hooks. But, unlike its Ranger sibling, the Everest received a fully-closed bodywork. Thus, from its profile, the long roof was extended behind the rear seats. By creating a raked-forward D-pillar adorned with a chromed trim, the automaker managed to hide the SUV's utilitarian roots. Finally, at the back, the taillights were extended from the quarter panels onto the tailgate and were visually connected with a chromed slat that sported the Everest nameplate. Inside, the Everest carried over Ranger's dashboard that featured a generous infotainment system placed atop the center stack. Also, the instrument cluster was fully digital, with a rectangular display in the middle flanked by the speedometer and tachometer on separate TFTs. Depending on the trim level, the Everest boasted a leather-wrapped interior for the higher grades, while the base models were offered with cloth upholstery. Its seven-seat capacity transformed the Everest into a sought-after vehicle, and Ford kept that attribute. Under the hood, Ford announced a V6 turbo-diesel developed with Volkswagen. The base version, on the other hand, was powered by a 2.0-liter bi-turbo oil burner. Both versions sent their torque in all corners via a ten-speed automatic transmission.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Everest"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""utilitarian"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""spacious"", ""stylish""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""C-shaped"", ""daytime running""],    ""bumper"": [""lower"", ""sporty""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""long"", ""extended"", ""raked-forward""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Escape,"Ford refreshed the fourth generation of the Escape in 2022 for the 2023 model year and improved the car's look, the interior, and most importantly, the drivetrain. Sharing its platform with the European Ford Kuga or with the Focus' fourth generation, the Escape proved to be a good bet for those looking for a crossover perfectly suitable for the urban environment. Moreover, it managed to be a good companion on long runs, albeit its rather short wheelbase didn't recommend it for cross-continental drives. Moving to the facelifted version, the Escape offered a redesigned front fascia that featured narrower headlights with angular LED daytime running lights inside. Unlike its predecessor, the 2023 model featured a higher-mounted grille with a wide hexagonal shape and had the blue-oval badge mounted on it instead of on the upper side of the bumper. From its profile, the 2023 Escape didn't change too much, save for the front bumper. Finally, the rear side of the crossover sported redesigned taillights. Inside, the most significant difference was on the dashboard, which received a new infotainment unit placed atop the center stack. It featured SYNC 4 technology that allowed a cloud-connected navigation system. In addition, it had wireless Apple CarPlay and Android auto smart driving capability. Ford offered the Escape as a gasoline-only version, a hybrid, or a plug-in hybrid version.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Escape"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""urban-friendly"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""narrower""],    ""grille"": [""higher-mounted"", ""wide hexagonal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angular"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""redesigned"", ""front""],    ""wheel"": [""short wheelbase""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Wildtrak,"Ford introduced a brand new generation of its well-known pickup Ranger in 2021 and, to live up to its reputation, the carmaker introduced the Wildtrak version as well. The Ranger was the best-selling pickup in Europe, the UK, and other countries around the world. Its simple construction, rugged chassis, and fuel-efficient engines made it a great choice over its competitors. Thanks to the U.S. know-how carried over from the F-150, the 2021 Ranger became even more desirable not only by contractors and used as a workhorse but also as a lifestyle vehicle. At the front, its C-shaped daytime running lights surrounded the outer sides of the headlights, resembling those installed on the Bronco and the F-150. Its massive front grille was designed to accommodate larger radiators for the V6 turbodiesel engine and also incorporated a lower area fit for aftermarket winches. Ford worked together with ARB for that, so the owners received strong support for that. Finally, at the lower side of the bumper, the carmaker installed two recovery hooks. From its sides, the Ranger featured a pair of functional vents on the front fenders, which was unusual. Those were installed to help cool the engine. At the back, the Ranger featured its nameplate stamped on the tailgate and the third brake light. Inside, on the center stack, the Ranger Wildtrak featured a 12”, portrait-mode infotainment screen fitted with the SYNC4 system. The electronic selector for the automatic transmission sported the buttons for manually engaging the gears sat between the front seats, on the center console. Next to it, a group of buttons controlled the transfer case. Under the hood, the carmaker placed the 3.0-liter V6 developed together with Volkswagen. The German carmaker chose to partner with Ford for the Ranger/Amarok lineup.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ranger"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""functional"", ""desirable"", ""simple construction""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""front""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""C-shaped"", ""surrounded"", ""outer sides""],    ""bumper"": [""lower area"", ""recovery hooks""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Ranger Double Cab,"After almost a year since it launched the Ranger on the Australian and European markets, Ford finally introduced the U.S. version of it in the North American Continent. Built in the same factory as the Bronco, the 2024 Ranger shared most of its components with its non-American cousins. Still, it had some aces up its sleeves to be more attractive to customers from its home country. In addition, since it was smaller than the F150, it was a better choice for urban environments, and it could also serve as a family car since it was available exclusively with a four-door cabin. The exterior look resembled those from other continents, featuring big headlights with C-shaped outer daytime running lights and a broad grille between them. The front bumper was neatly continued downwards and featured cutaways with exposed towing hooks, just in case someone gets stuck in the mud. From its sides, the classic four-door pickup look was enhanced by sculptured lines on the doors. Finally, at the back, the five-foot (1.5 m) long bed was wide enough to fit a four-foot (1.2 m) plywood between the wheel arches. In addition, Ford fitted the tailgate with a bottle opener on one side and a hook on the other, and on the edges, it added a ruler and clam pockets, just like on the F150. Inside, even the lower trim levels got an 8"" LCD for the instrument panel and a ten-inch one for the infotainment system. Ford offered a 12"" display for the cluster and a 12.4"" touchscreen atop the center stack for the higher trim levels. While the standard upholstery was fabric, customers could also choose a leather-wrapped interior. At the time of launch, Ford offered the Ranger powered by a 2.3-liter turbocharged engine, and later it added a 2.7-liter twin-turbo V6. The standard transmission for the entire range was the well-known 10-speed automatic. 2WD and 4WD versions were available.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ranger"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""smaller than F150"",  ""overall-design"": [""attractive"", ""urban-friendly"", ""family-oriented"", ""classic"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""big"", ""C-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [""neat"", ""functional""],    ""wheel"": [""wide""],    ""doors"": [""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Expedition,"Ford refreshed the fourth generation of the Expedition lineup in 2021 for the 2022 model, adding some changes here and there while removing some other features. The carmaker built the Expedition with family needs in mind ever since the first generation, which appeared on the market in 1996. By 2018, when it launched the fourth sequel of the full-size SUV, the car was more or less an expensive luxobarge built to tow campers, boats, and other trailers for family activities. For the 2022 model, the carmaker noted its customers' preferences and added some changes. On the outside, the main changes were for the paint, where it deleted the Blue and Gold colors, replacing them with the Antimatter Blue and the Kodiak Brown ones. In addition, since the Expedition had to cope with various demands, from off-roading to trailer hauling and family trips, Ford provided the vehicle with a wide option of wheels ranged between 17"" and 22"" in size. Ford also tried to answer better to its customers' demands when it made the 2022 Expedition available in 13 equipment groups. Despite an increasing demand for comfort, the carmaker deleted the conversation mirror from the overhead console. In the safety department, the carmaker worked on the Ford Co-pilot360 Assist and offered it as standard on the Limited version. In addition, an 8"" LCD Capacitive Touchscreen with swipe capability, Android Auto, and Apple CarPlay was included in the STX package. The main differences on the drivetrain were for the Electronic Limited Slip Differential (eLSD), which was removed from the Heavy-Duty Trailer tow package and introduced as an option for the rest of the range.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Expedition"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""full-size SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""expensive"", ""family-oriented"", ""versatile"", ""comfortable"", ""safe""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""17-22\"""", ""wide options""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Fiesta 5 Doors,"Ford refreshed the Fiesta Active model in 2021 and enhanced its drivetrain with electrified versions while it dropped the turbodiesel engines on the way. In 2017, Ford introduced the seventh generation of the Fiesta lineup and added a crossover version named Active. The carmaker tried to compete against the market leader Renault Captur, which was also based on a small-segment vehicle, the Clio. Five years later, the blue-oval brand added a well-deserved facelift for the entire Fiesta range, including the Active version. Regardless of the technological improvements, a carmaker has to upgrade the exterior of a refreshed car, and Ford knew that. The most striking innovation was on the front bumper, which received a new, L-shaped set of trims on the side scoops. Since the carmaker added the Matrix-LED headlights, the overall front look of the vehicle showed a bolder stance on the road. In addition, its grille featured vertical slats instead of the mesh design used for the 2017 model year. At the back, the carmaker offered the Active with an option for LED taillights. Changes continued on the interior where Ford installed a 12.3” digital instrument display, which replaced the former analog dials. Atop on the center stack, Fiesta Active featured the same infotainment system as its non-facelifted version. But the most significant change was under the hood, where Ford dropped the fuel-efficient turbodiesel engines. Instead, it replaced them with new, mild-hybrid versions with a 48-volt architecture that complemented the regular, inline-three gasoline powerplants.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Fiesta Active"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""electrified"", ""crossover"", ""bolder"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""vertical"", ""slatted""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""Matrix-LED"", ""bold""],    ""bumper"": [""front"", ""L-shaped"", ""new trims"", ""side scoops""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD F-150 Raptor,"Ford released the third generation of the F150 Raptor in 2021 as a 2022 model year, and it was meaner and hard-core than before. In 2009, Ford stunned the world with the introduction of the Raptor's first generation. It was praised for its high-speed off-road abilities. Soon, the competition started to match its performances and caught-up. But then, the blue-oval brand released a second generation. In 2021, with the third generation, it was even tougher and readier to fly over bumps, dunes and potholes. But Ford didn't forget to make it look business. Maybe it looked too massive to make someone think that the F150 Raptor could jump, even though it did it easily. Its flat front grille featured the big FORD lettering on it, sidelined by a pair of LED headlights. Ford's designers didn't try to hide the aluminum skid-plate under the engine and pulled it to the front bumper. From its sides, it was the regular, four-door F150 with a separated bed in the back. The interior was slightly reworked when compared to a regular loaded with options F150 Crew Cab. Active Orange punctuated an interior packed with Tremor detailing, including unique seat trim with superior stitching, materials, and finishes for the center stack, center console, and doors. A wide TFT display filled the instrument cluster and offered various functions for the car, including specific ones for the Raptor version. Apart from the new twin-turbo engine paired to a 10-speed gearbox, the Raptor featured a special-tuned chassis. The five-link rear suspension featured extra-long trailing arms to maintain a better axle position on rough terrain, a Panhard rod and 24-inch coil springs - the longest in the class.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""F150 Raptor"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""massive"",  ""overall-design"": [""mean"", ""hard-core"", ""tough"", ""business"", ""aggressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""flat"", ""front"", ""big""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""aluminum"", ""skid-plate"", ""front""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""four-door"", ""separated bed""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Focus Wagon,"Ford made the Focus Active Wagon as an alternative to classic station wagons. It provided more ground clearance while it kept the same fuel-efficient engines. With its vertical slats, the grille sported the blue-oval badge, which moved there from the hood as on the non-facelifted version. An important upgrade was for the headlights, which were LED for the entire range. It marked a big step forward to modern-era cars. The daytime running light pattern was moved inside the headlamps and encircled the darker central section. In addition, the carmaker tried to mix the classic station wagon bodywork with an SUV-inspired stance and parts for the Active Wagon version. Thus, the crossover featured black, unpainted plastic parts that underlined the lower side of the bodywork. In addition, a satin-chromed shield peaked at the lower part of the front bumper and was complemented by a similar-looking underbody protection element under the rear bumper. For the interior, Ford focused on the technology department and installed the SYNC 4 infotainment system. It features a new 13.2"" touchscreen placed atop the center stack. Unlike other carmakers in the compact, mass-market segment, it provided more features, including voice commands for accepting calls and navigation and controlling the audio and climate control systems. Since it shared the same bodywork with the station-wagon version, the Focus Active Wagon provided a 608 liter (21.5 cu-ft) trunk, which the user could expand up to 1,653 liters (58.4 cu-ft) with the rear bench folded.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Focus Active Wagon"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""modern"", ""SUV-inspired"", ""fuel-efficient""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""vertical slats"", ""blue-oval badge""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""modern"", ""daytime running light pattern""],    ""bumper"": [""satin-chromed shield"", ""underbody protection""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Focus ST 5 doors,"Ever since its first-generation, Focus provided a sportier version named ST. Later on, an RS version with more ponies under the hood and race-inspired technology took the flagship role. When Ford updated the fourth generation of the Focus in 2020, it couldn't leave the ST version aside. Even though the car was not fuel-efficient and the carmaker had to deal with European penalties for that. It was built because a flagship model was needed. Something to brag about. And thus, the Focus hot-hatch returned as a different kind of animal in the Focus stable. There is an important change at the front fascia, where the carmaker installed a black honeycomb grille that sported the Ford badge in the middle. It was flanked by the LED headlights with an option for Dynamic Pixel LED lamps. The foglight was also included on their inner side. Its daytime running lights were converted into turn signals when needed. From its sides, the 18"" light-alloy wheels were standard, with an option for a 19"" set sported a unique design for the ST version. Ford bragged about their in-hose designed and developed front sport bucket seats with high bolstering for the interior. They were made for excellent lateral support during high-speed cornering. With its TFT display instead of analog dials, the ST version tried to ditch the older gauges but provided more information for the driver. A 13.2"" large infotainment display that featured the SYNC4 system sat atop the center stack. Under the hood, the carmaker installed the same 2.3-liter powerplant mated to a six-speed manual gearbox. Yet, a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) was on the options list for those who didn't enjoy the three-pedal setup.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Focus"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""aggressive"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black"", ""honeycomb""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""Dynamic Pixel"", ""flanked""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""18-inch"", ""19-inch"", ""light-alloy"", ""unique design""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Focus 5 Doors,"Ford introduced the fourth generation of the Focus compact lineup in 2018 but didn't wait too much until it refreshed it in 2020 for the 2021 model-year. The Focus started as a global car in 1998 and has evolved ever since. For 2018 model, it offered a completely new design, which was kept for the 2021 facelift. Although there were a few styling updates that made it look different. A slight upgrade was noticeable at the hood, which received a taller front grille, making room for a higher ""nose."" Also, the blue-oval badge was relocated and placed in front of the radiator instead. An important upgrade was for the headlights, which were LED for the entire range. It marked a big step forward to modern-era cars. The daytime running light pattern was moved inside the headlamps and encircled the darker central section. Like its predecessors, the 2021 Focus was available in a few body shapes. The five-door hatchback was among the most popular choice. It featured a sloped tailgate with a roof spoiler. Its landscape-oriented taillights emerged from the quarter panels onto the tailgate, under the rear window. For the interior, Ford focused on the technology department and installed the SYNC 4 infotainment system. It features a new 12.3"" touchscreen placed atop the center stack. Unlike other carmakers in the compact, mass-market segment, it provided more features, including voice commands not just for accepting calls but also for navigation and controlling the audio and climate control systems. For the drivetrain, Ford introduced hybrid and mild-hybrid versions powered by the 1.0-liter turbocharged Ecoboost engines. Thanks to its 48-volt architecture, the car increased its fuel efficiency and lowered its CO2 emissions. In addition, a belt-driven integrated starter-generator helped reduce the turbo-lag.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Focus"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""modern"", ""sleek"", ""efficient""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""taller"", ""front""],    ""hood"": [""upgraded""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""modern"", ""encircled""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Fiesta ST,"In 2018, Ford dropped the five-door Fiesta ST and kept only the three-door version, which was a better competitor for other pocket-rockets on the market such as Mini Cooper S or, in Europe, Renault Clio Sport. Ford tried to make a sportier version for the Fiesta ever since the first generation, but it wasn’t until the fifth generation when it succeeded in introducing a true, performant version for it, named ST. The 2018 model was part of the seventh generation which Ford introduced on the market in late 2016. In 2017, the blue-oval brand launched the ST version with three and five doors but starting with 2018, it kept only the fewer doors version. It sported an aggressive styling with a hexagonal pattern on the mesh-grille at the front, adorned by the red ST badge on the left lower corner. In the bumper, Ford’s designers placed an additional grille to cool the intercooler and a set of side-scoops that hosted the fog lights. A set of 17” light-alloy-wheels was fitted as standard, while a set of 18” was on the options list. Inside, the carmaker garnished the cockpit with sport-inspired trims and a standard SYNC 3 infotainment system. The Recaro sport bucket-seats featured high-bolstered areas to prevent their occupants from sliding during high-speed cornering. A thick steering wheel with 12-o’clock stitching amplified the sport sensation of the car. From a technical point of view, the 2018 Fiesta ST was the first that featured a Quaife limited-slip differential (LSD). That helped the car in corners and made it faster around tracks. In addition, its 200 hp engine paired to a standard, close-ratio, six-speed manual made it an excellent track-day car in its class.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Fiesta ST"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""sporty"", ""performant"", ""stylish"", ""athletic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""hexagonal"", ""mesh"", ""aggressive""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""fog""],    ""bumper"": [""additional grille"", ""side-scoops""],    ""wheel"": [""17-inch light-alloy"", ""18-inch optional""],    ""doors"": [""three-door""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual""]  }}```"
FORD Mustang,"Ford unveiled at the Monterey Car Week in 2023 the wildest version ever for a Mustang: the GTD. With this version, the American automaker proved that it could build race-ready cars developed for tracks and adapted for the roads. The GTD was based not on the regular Mustang but on the GT3 race car that was unveiled in 2023 at Le Mans, and the three letters are carried over from the IMSA ""GTD"" racing class, which respects the FIA's GT3 standards. A small team of passionate engineers started to develop the outrageous Mustang GTD in 2021 in Allen Park, Michigan. Their intention was to create a vehicle to tackle European sports cars. In theory, the Mustang was not exactly the best idea. And yet, the team made it. First, they analyzed the exterior and created a new carbon fiber bodywork. It was a form-follow-function concept. There was nothing made just to visually impress. Everything was functional. As a result, the front fascia features a wide and wild-looking apron fitted with a trapezoidal lower cooling area flanked by a pair of air intakes needed to cool the massive front brakes. In addition, a double splitter and a couple of side winglets were installed to improve the front downforce at high speeds. The upper grille sported a honeycomb mesh pattern where the automaker placed the famous Mustang logo, but black instead of silver. On the redesigned hood, the team installed two safety locks and two massive vents closer to the hood. But they didn't want to let the same headlights as on the regular 'Stang, so they put a set of headlights with amber DRLs and LEDs. From its profile, the GTD boasted the most extensive vents ever installed on the front fenders of a Mustang. They were there to extract the air from the wheel wells. At the back, the rear fenders were significantly enlarged and sported air intakes that cooled the rear discs and the gearbox. Another unusual detail for a vehicle was noticed at the back, where a goose neck-style wing ensured the downforce for the rear axle. Moreover, that was hydraulically controlled and also featured a DRS function. The rear fascia featured more vents for a couple of radiators installed in the area where a regular Mustang had the trunk. Finally, under the bumper, within the diffuser, the automaker installed a pair of wide Akrapovic exhausts. Inside, the automaker deleted the rear bench seat and installed a pair of high-bolstered sports seats for the front occupants. One of the reasons it did that was because of the gearbox mounted in the back. Power came from the engine via a carbon fiber shaft to it via a transmission tunnel. Under the hood, Ford installed a supercharged 5.2-liter V8 that was said to develop up to 800 HP (811 PS). The power went to the rear wheels via an eight-speed automatic gearbox built for racing. And yet, the car was made to be completely street-legal. As a result, the 2025 GTD became the most potent road-going Mustang to that date.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mustang GTD"",  ""year"": ""2025"",  ""size"": ""wide and wild-looking"",  ""overall-design"": [""race-ready"", ""outrageous"", ""functional"", ""street-legal"", ""potent""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wide"", ""trapezoidal"", ""honeycomb mesh""],    ""hood"": [""redesigned"", ""ventilated""],    ""headlights"": [""amber DRLs"", ""LEDs""],    ""bumper"": [""wide"", ""diffuser""],    ""wheel"": [""extensive vents""],    ""doors"": [""high-bolstered sports seats""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""wide""],    ""spoiler"": [""goose neck-style"", ""hydraulically controlled"", ""DRS function""],    ""exhaust"": [""wide Akrapovic""]  }}```"
FORD F-150 Super Crew,"Ford seems like it locked a hard off-road team and asked them to do a professional all-terrain pickup truck smart enough to be driven by newbies on expert trails. Most of the off-road fans are customizing their trucks. Nobody wants to tackle a challenging trail with a showroom condition pickup-truck. Changing the tires is just for starters, but soon follows the suspension, skid plates, transmission, and so on. Ford engineers asked themselves if they cannot do that right from the start and do it better. So they took an F150 and upgraded it, and named it F150 Tremor. The exterior looked mostly like a regular F150, but it was broader and taller. On the bodywork, there were some orange decals on the grille and the sides. As for why was the new beast taller and wider, that's a different story. The interior was slightly reworked when compared to a regular loaded with options F150 Crew Cab. Active Orange punctuated an interior packed with Tremor detailing, including unique seat trim with superior stitching, materials, and finishes for the instrument panel, center console, and doors. But the real upgrades were under the military-grade aluminum bodywork. The engineers installed a new suspension with higher ground clearance, with one inch at the front and 1.5"" in the rear. There was one damper on the front side and two in the back. A set of bigger, 33"" General Grabber all-terrain tires increased the ground clearance with an additional 1"" all around. The transmission was reworked and featured a locking rear differential. A front locker was on the options list beside the standard LSD system. A complete set of skid plates protected the pickup-truck underbody as for towing capacity, which remained unchanged to 10.900 pounds (4944 kg).",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""F150 Tremor"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""broader, taller"",  ""overall-design"": [""off-road"", ""all-terrain"", ""upgraded"", ""military-grade"", ""aggressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""orange decals""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""bigger"", ""33\"" General Grabber all-terrain tires""],    ""doors"": [""unique seat trim"", ""superior stitching"", ""materials"", ""finishes""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Explorer,"The sixth generation of the Ford Explorer was launched at the North American Motor Show in 2019 and it shared its platform with the Lincoln Aviator. It represented the return to the RWD platform. The original Ford Explorer was launched in 1991 and it replaced the two-door Bronco II model. Its name came from a trim-package used for the F-Series between 1967 and 1986. Over time, it evolved into a mid-size crossover SUV. It was equipped with the Ford Co-Pilot360 system that included automatic emergency braking, pre-collision assist, Lane-Keep System, blind-spot monitor, and cross-traffic alert. The big, mesh-grille on the front with flash-mounted headlights were part of a sporty look of the vehicle. A big air-dam was on the apron, which helps to cool the engine. While the first generation of the Explorer was a true offroad vehicle, with low-range gear and body-on-frame structure, the 2020 model featured a unibody construction, which was lighter and improved the fuel-efficiency. Inside, the car featured a hi-tech approach, with a TFT instrument cluster and an infotainment display on top of the center stack. There were two displays in the options list: an 8” landscape-type and a 10” portrait-type. The Explorer was available with three seat rows, with the middle ones offered with reclining and sliding function. Under the hood, the Explorer could receive a choice of engines ranged between an inline-four up to a twin-turbo V6. It was available as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid as well.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ford Explorer"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""mid-size crossover SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""hi-tech"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""dynamic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""big"", ""mesh""],    ""hood"": [""flash-mounted""],    ""headlights"": [""flash-mounted""],    ""bumper"": [""big"", ""air-dam""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Galaxy,"Ford introduced the third generation of the Galaxy MPV in Europe in 2015, and after four years, it refreshed it, trying to keep up with the market changes in terms of styling, emission levels, and technology. The European minivan segment was highly contested by several brands, and Ford tried to impose the Galaxy as a stylish, family-friendly vehicle but with several sports-inspired details. Starting with the 2019 model year, the blue-oval brand aligned the styling with the Mondeo, with which it shared its platform. Unlike the market-segment leader, the Renault Espace, the Galaxy was available with potent engines and all-wheel-drive versions. Moreover, it provided options fit for luxurious vehicles, but unlike the Sharan from Volkswagen, it lacked sliding rear doors that were easier to use in tight parking spots. As a result, the sales were not impressive, and in 2022, Ford decided to pull the plug on its largest European minivan. At first sight, it was not significantly changed compared to its predecessor, but still, a keen eye for detail could notice the clear-lenses fog lights and the enhanced headlights. In addition, the top-spec version sported a nice hexagonal grille fitted with a 3D-mesh styling and surrounded by a chromed rim. Furthermore, the lower bumper had a lower lip and side scoops adorned with shiny silver trims. From its profile, there were no significant changes. The main advantage of the Galaxy over its competitors was its wide rear doors, which eased ingress and egress to the vehicle. Finally, at the back, Ford offered a hands-free opening tailgate. The taillights were also restyled. Inside, the Galaxy was a true family and friends hauler. There were three rows of seats where up to eight adults could sit in a 2-3-2 layout. At the front, the high-mounted seats featured individual armrests and were separated by a tall center console that housed the gear stick, a pair of cup holders, and an armrest with a storage area underneath it. One of the most important upgrades of the 2019 Galaxy was noticed on the center stack. There, Ford installed a brand-new infotainment system fitted with an eight-inch touchscreen. Furthermore, the driver could use voice commands and the buttons on the steering wheel. The second row of seats could slide and tilt forward to ease access to the rearmost seating position. There were loads of headroom for everyone and enough legroom for six-feet passengers. Under the hood, the improved gasoline engine lineup consisted of two turbocharged units, while the turbodiesel range was covered by a choice of four two-liter powerplants ranging between 120 PS (118 hp) and 210 PS (207 hp). Power went to the front or all four wheels via either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic, depending on the engine version and options.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ford Galaxy"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""stylish"", ""family-friendly"", ""sports-inspired"", ""luxurious"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""hexagonal"", ""3D-mesh"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""enhanced"", ""clear-lenses""],    ""bumper"": [""lower lip"", ""side scoops"", ""shiny silver trims""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""wide rear doors""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Kuga,"The Ford Kuga was first produced in 2008 and was also called the Ford Escape on some markets such as the U.S. Like the Ford Focus and Ford C-Max, the Kuga is based on the C1 platform and it comes in several versions, a 1.5-liter & a 2.0-liter EcoBlue diesel, and a 1.5-liter EcoBoost gasoline engine, followed by plug-in hybrid variants, Kuga EcoBlue Hybrid (mild-hybrid) and Kuga Hybrid (full-hybrid). The new Kuga model benefits from the latest automotive technologies and hi-tech features like Stop & Go, Speed Sign Recognition, Lane-Centring, wireless charging pad, FordPass Connect embedded modem, B&O Sound System, 12.3-inch LCD, and Ford's SYNC 3 infotainment system accompanied by an 8-inch central touchscreen. The parking can be done automatically through Active Park Assist 2, a useful technology that makes life easier for its users. The new Ford Kuga comes with more interior space making the car more comfortable, revised aerodynamics (thus reducing weight and fuel consumption) and augmented architecture for improved crash performance. Furthermore, due to a longer wheelbase, the stability on the road has increased, and with Post-Collision Braking technology (that reduces the impact of a potential secondary collision), Ford has made the Kuga model inherently safer.

FORD GT,"2020 Ford GT has been unveiled and is ready to take your breath away. Literally. It has a fresh new look, and with it, an overall extended appeal. The new GT comes with the same v6, 3.5-liter engine tuned with gallery-cooled pistons and higher-energy ignition coils. The engineering team also modified the engine cooling and airflow by fitting a lighter Akrapovic titanium exhaust that provides nine-pound weight savings over its predecessor while featuring that deeply profound, unmistakable vibrant sound emanating from the powerful Ecoboost engine. And with 13 more hp than its predecessor, the refreshed Ford GT is rounding up a colossal 660 hp. The 7-speed automatic gearbox remains untouched. Ford will also introduce a Liquid Carbon GT version that comes with carbon fiber wheels, titanium lug nuts, six-point racing harness anchors, five interior options, five caliper colors and most importantly with the body of the car completely free of paint, leaving the model with a visible weaved exterior surface. The clear coat is designed to highlight the carbon fiber body, leaving the unmistakable feeling that Ford is constantly raising its game for its customers through this ultimate expression of innovation.

FORD S-Max,"Being a facelift for the model's second generation, the 2020 Ford S-Max represents a stylish makeover of the functional MPV. With production beginning in 2006, the S-Max is presented by Ford as an ""SAV – sports activity vehicle,"" a vehicle that falls somewhere between a sedan and an MPV. Even though it only offers one engine option, the 2.0-liter EcoBlue diesel engine, the vehicle has multiple options when it comes to transmission. It can be equipped with a standard six-speed manual transmission or an eight-speed automatic transmission capable of providing better fuel economy. To optimize fuel efficiency and provide a smoother ride and increased comfort, the vehicle comes equipped with adaptive cruise control paired with a Stop & Go function. The feature's usefulness comes from the fact that if the vehicle doesn't stop for more than three seconds in traffic when the car in front gets rolling, the Ford follows it automatically. The MPV has a redesigned front part, giving it a more aesthetic look. The upper grille and the fog lights contour come with a bright chrome look that provides the S-Max with a refreshed appearance. For the ST-line version, the chrome turns black to highlight the trademark honeycomb upper grille better. To provide the Ford with a more refined look, there are 18-inch two-tone wheels as well as pearl grey 15-spoke alloy wheels available as an option. For better versatility, the interior is available in a five-seat configuration and also in a seven-seat format to suit the various need of the customers. The MPV is made to easily accommodate an increased number of passengers or provide ample cargo space within the same structure. The main attraction of the interior is the ""Campaign for Healthier Backs"" approved seats. They are adjustable in 18 to provide maximum support and offer a comfortable and pain-free ride, even if it is a very long trip. The seats are certified by an independent testing committee of experts from various medical fields. They are created to adapt to a person's position, not for the person to adjust their position to the seat. The 2020 S-Max is also available in a Vignale specification that provides the model with Salerno leather interior wrapping, aluminum interior touches, a heated steering wheel, and upgraded front seats that are heated, cooled, and also have a massage function. To help customers better understand their vehicles, Ford offers an optional FordPass Connect technology that enables the owner to remotely access the vehicle's location, fuel levels, alarm status, oil life, and more, all through the FordPass mobile app. The 2020 Ford S-Max represents one of the most subtle MPVs, as it offers increased practicability through more than enough cargo space and extended passenger capacity while maintaining an aerodynamic look thanks to its curved edges.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ford S-Max"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""MPV"",  ""overall-design"": [""stylish"", ""aesthetic"", ""refined"", ""subtle"", ""aerodynamic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""curved""],    ""grille"": [""bright chrome"", ""black for ST-line""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""fog lights""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""18-inch two-tone"", ""pearl grey 15-spoke alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Figo,"The second generation of the Ford Figo was the Indian brother of the European Ford Ka+. It was unveiled in 2015 and refreshed three years later. The Indian market was keen for small-sized vehicles, due to crowded cities and small parking spaces. The price was an important factor as well. With that said, Ford decided to offer a low-budget vehicle but with high standards of safety and quality. The facelifted Figo featured a new bumper design, with integrated foglights on the outer side. A “C” trim was mounted on the sides of the apron for the Blue trim level (top-spec). A new set of light-alloy wheels was available on the options list. In the back, Ford enhanced the bumper and installed a roof-spoiler with integrated third brake light. Inside, the base model featured two airbags, but the top-of-the-range version was fitted with an infotainment system, six airbags, and the word “Blue” embroiled on the seatbacks of the front seats. The car was fitted with air-conditioning and four power windows and locks. Under the hood, the 2018 Ford Figo was fitted with a new engine: the 1.2-liter gasoline unit. It offered 95 hp and it was paired as standard to a five-speed manual.

FORD Edge,"The Ford Edge was a mid-size crossover that offered seating for five. Easy to drive and easy to manoeuvre around town and also available with powerful engine, it was a great fit for families. An extensive list of the latest technologies was available depending on the trim level. The trim levels available with the 2018 Edge were the SE, the SEL, Titanium and Sport. The Titanium was more luxury-oriented, while the Sport version offered a more engaging and attractive ride with the most powerful engine in the range. The SE was pretty well equipped with 18-inch alloys, automatic headlights, air-conditioning, a rear-view camera, Bluetooth connectivity, voice controls, rear privacy glass and an USB port. Going to the upper trim level, the SEL, the Edge came equipped with LED headlight stripes, heated side mirrors, rear parking sensors, dual-zone automatic climate control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and power-adjustable front seats. A package that added leather upholstery, heated front seats, an upgraded audio system, smartphone integration (AppleCar Play and Android Auto) and an 8-inch touchscreen was available for the SEL model. More luxurious, the Edge with the Titanium trim level featured bigger 19-inch wheels, noise-reducing front windows, ambient interior lighting, front sport seats and a 12-speaker Sony sound system. Customers interested in more power had the option of going with the Sport trim level.

Various updates were made over the years to keep the Fusion fresh, and for 2019, Ford updated the exterior design and added even more standard features. For 2019, the 5-passenger midsize sedan was available in 5 trim levels: the S, the SE, the SEL, the Titanium and the V6 Sport. We found the base trim level to be well-equipped, with the Fusion featuring a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine that developed 173 hp. A front-wheel-drive system was standard and the powerplant was mated with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The standard features included 16-inch steel wheels, automatic headlights, cruise control, air-conditioning, a rearview camera, Bluetooth connectivity, a 4.2-inch display and an USB port. The Co-Pilot360 Protect package added blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision mitigation and lane keeping assist. The 2.5-liter unit was a little underpowered and for the ones looking for a punchy engine, the upper trim levels or even the top-of-the-range would had been a better choice. Moving to the upper SEL trim level, the Fusion featured LED headlights, adaptive cruise control and a navigation system. Starting with this trim level, the all-wheel-drive system became available. Also standard were an automatic stop-start system, 17-inch alloys, rear heat ducts, an 8-inch touchscreen, Apply CarPlay and Android Auto, a navigation system, as well as two USB ports. The SE appearance package was optional and added 18-inch black wheels and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. The SEL trim level was comfort and practicality oriented, while the Titanium was equipped with the more powerful 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, 19-inch alloys and more luxurious features. As expected, the V6 Sport offered the most powerful engine in the range, a 2.7-liter turbocharged V6 engine that developed 325 hp. Besides the slightly different exterior look, the top-of-the-range offered an adjustable suspension and even an automated parking system for parallel and perpendicular parking.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ford Fusion"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""midsize sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""appealing"", ""well-equipped"", ""punchy"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""refreshed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""adaptive""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""16-inch"", ""17-inch"", ""18-inch"", ""19-inch""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Tourneo,"The need for a car that can be used as a people carrier and a utility vehicle was proven over the time and, in 2018, Ford launched the Transit Connect with 7 seats at the Chicago Auto Show. The Transit Connect Wagon started its life as a utility vehicle. It was adapted for family use or a team of workers in the same vehicle with their tools and, why not, a ladder strapped on the roof. For others, it was their family vehicle with a surfboard on top. Short front, two available lengths, and up to seven seats inside. These were, for short, the most important features of the 2018 Ford Transit Connect Wagon. The large MPV was also available with a long wheelbase and up to 7 seats. If the middle and the rear seats were folded or removed, a very big platform was formed and transformed it into a camper-van. It offered interesting features for its class, especially for the safety systems, such as the Automatic Emergency Braking that included the Pre-Collision Assist with Pedestrian Detection. The technology offered by Ford in that MPV was also noticeable in the infotainment unit with the Sync3 system that featured a 6.5"" touch-screen. To move the vehicle, Ford installed two engine options: a 1.5-liter turbodiesel or a 2.0-liter gasoline unit. Both were mated to a standard 8-speed automatic transmission built for economy.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Transit Connect Wagon"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""Short front, two available lengths"",  ""overall-design"": [""Versatile"", ""Functional"", ""Adaptable"", ""Spacious"", ""Safe""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""Adequate size""],    ""grille"": [""Simple""],    ""hood"": [""Short""],    ""headlights"": [""Sleek""],    ""bumper"": [""Functional""],    ""wheel"": [""Standard size""],    ""doors"": [""Sliding""],    ""roof"": [""Adaptable""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Ka+,"The KA+ could be regarded to as the cheaper version of the Fiesta. The KA+ actually had the Fiesta’s underpinnings and was of a similar size. The dashboard design inside the KA+ had a similar design to the Fiesta’s, and while it looked good, the plastics’ quality was not that great The cabin offered decent storage rooms along with a good size glovebox. 4 cupholders were also well placed. Getting comfortable in the KA+ was not a hard thing to do with the height adjustable seats, as well as the adjustable steering wheel (up and down only). The KA+ came in 2 trim levels: Studio and Zetec. The Studio trim level offered all the necessary basics such as electric windows, air conditioning, Bluetooth connectivity, an USB port and an AUX jack, along with electric mirrors, front fog lamps and an alarm. The upper trim level offered alloy wheels and a leather steering wheel and sync voice recognition. The KA+ was available with a 5-door body shape only and was mostly designed for families with smaller children. The space in the rear seats was decent, but not the best for adults. The back doors had a wide opening, thus mounting a baby seat or taking it out was not hard to do. The trunk had no exterior handle and needed to be opened by pressing the button on the center console or the one on the key fob. The trunk size was good for a city car in its class, with only 10 liters less than the Fiesta’s. The cargo area could also be extended by folding the rear seats. The single engine available for the KA+ was a 1.2-liter gasoline – one of 69 hp for the Studio version, and 84 hp for the Zetec.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""KA+"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""similar to Fiesta"",  ""overall-design"": [""affordable"", ""family-friendly"", ""practical""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""alloy for Zetec""],    ""doors"": [""5-door body shape""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Mondeo Wagon,"The Ford Mondeo was introduced to the market in 1993 and it was produced ever since. In 2014 it reached its fourth generation, but it had to be refreshed due to European regulations. The fourth generation of the Mondeo received an ample facelift in 2019. It wasn't only for the looks but for the technological part as well. Due to its cavernous trunk space, the station-wagon version was one of the roomiest cars in its class. The exterior of the car featured a new trapezoidal grille shape with a 3D effect. For the Titanium trim levels, it featured horizontal chrome slats. The lower apron featured a new grille as well and new fog lights. For the ST version, smaller winglets were added on the sides. In the back, the C-shaped taillights were intersected by a stylish, trim in satin silver or chrome, depending on the car's version. Inside, the customers had a long options list to chose from and to select the interior's look. From different trims to different infotainment systems and instrument cluster. The base version was fitted with a combination of analog and digital display. The seats were comfortable and also offered in a few upholstery and comfort levels, but the split-fold rear seats were fitted as standard. Under the hood, the Mondeo station-wagon was offered with a wide choice of diesel, gasoline, and hybrid versions. Depending on the powering option, the car was fitted with a 6-speed manual, a CVT, or an 8-speed automatic.

FORD EcoSport,"Ford introduced a heavily facelifted version of the EcoSport model in 2017, which completely transformed the car. The first generation of the EcoSport was designed and produced in Brazil, and it sold well, but it was available only in a few countries. Then, for the second generation, Ford produced it in more locations and made the EcoSport available in more countries, including Europe. It wasn't precisely what the Europeans were looking for on a small-sized crossover until 2017 when the blue-oval brand introduced the facelifted version. With a heavily improved design, the 2017 EcoSport featured a new front fascia with a grille inspired by the European Mondeo lineup. Its angular headlights, swept-back to the sides, and corner-mounted turn signals made the little crossover look more aggressive. On the sides, the ascending beltline was adorned by a chromed line toward the C-pillars. The only old feature that couldn't be re-worked was the tailgate, which was side-hinged. Inside, Ford prepared a modern interior with a SYNC infotainment system on top of the center stack. Its three-spoke steering wheel with buttons on it was also new. The carmaker installed a TFT display between the speedometer and tachometer for the on-board computer in the instrument panel. Since it shared its platform with the Fiesta, it didn't have a long wheelbase but still offered adequate room for the rear passengers. Under the hood, Ford installed modern engines, including the awarded 1.0-liter EcoBoost. It was no longer a car for the emerging markets only.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""EcoSport"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""small-sized crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""heavily improved"", ""modern"", ""aggressive"", ""angular"", ""swept-back""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""European-inspired""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angular"", ""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""modern""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Fiesta 3 Doors,"The Fiesta started its story with a 3-door version, back in the 70s. Eventually, it gained another pair of doors to ease access to the rear seats. In time, from the no-AC vehicle, it grew and became a stylish car. In 2017, the new Fiesta 3-door was launched at a special event and brought some novelties for the small Ford vehicle. For the 3-door version, Ford introduced the Ford Fiesta Vignale model - part of the Ford Vignale upscale product and ownership experience. The Fiesta Vignale joins the Mondeo, S-MAX, Kuga and Edge Vignale models as the highest expression of the Ford brand in Europe, and offers unique 18-inch alloys wheel designs, exclusive exterior detailing and colors, and hexagonal-quilted, tuxedo-stitched leather seats. It also featured a premium B&O PLAY Sound System, and for the first time offers an openable panoramic glass roof.

FORD Ranger Super Cab,"The third generation of the European Ford Ranger was introduced in 2011. It received a facelift in 2015, raising its status from a simple, utility pickup truck, to a lifestyle vehicle. The 2015 Ranger Super Cab was part of the Ford Ranger lineup and it was refreshed as well. Even though it wasn't a true five-seat vehicle and more of a two-seat one, it was continued and sold along the rest of its brothers with some improvements. From the outside, the most striking modification was at the front, where a chromed grille with three wide bars was installed. The new angled headlights were swept on the fenders, like most of the SUVs on the market. The door-mirrors featured chromed cases, to enhance the adventure look even in a parking lot. Inside, the 2015 Ranger Super Cab was offered with the new, SYNC 2 connectivity system, which was available with voice commands. It featured an 8” touchscreen with color-coded corners for easy menu navigation. The Super Cab body featured regular front doors and rear-hinged half-door in the back. Inside the cabin, there were two regular seats for the front occupants and a small bench in the back, for temporary use. It was more useful as a trunk. The 2015 model featured an evolution of the 2.2-liter diesel engine, which was offered in two power options: 130 hp and 160 hp, respectively. The top of the range Wildtrak version was equipped with the same inline-five 3.2-liter unit good for 200 hp. Apart from the later version, all the others were available with 4x4 on-demand or two-wheel-drive. The Wildtrak was 4x4 only.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ranger Super Cab"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""lifestyle"", ""adventurous"", ""utility""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""angled""],    ""grille"": [""chromed"", ""wide-bar""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angled"", ""swept""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""front"", ""rear-hinged""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Ranger Regular Cab,"A revised version of the Ford Ranger was released in 2015. It wasn't a completely new model, but a facelift that improved the comfort and the performance of the most sold pickup in Europe. Since it was introduced in 2011, the third generation of the Ford Ranger grew on the market and succeeded to gain more than one-fifth of the market. The experience gained by Ford in building and selling pickup trucks in the U.S. paid off in Europe too. With the facelift, the 2015 Ranger Regular cab offered a new front design. The headlights were smaller and placed upper, to protect them from small scratches and hits by the bushes or in parking lots. A chromed grille was adopted for the upper trim levels. It was noticed that European customers started to use the Ranger as a lifestyle truck, for outdoor sports, off-road trips and less for work. Inside, the base versions were poorly equipped and prepared for being used as workhorses on the construction sites. For the upper trim levels and for the top of the range Wildtrak version the interior featured an advanced infotainment system, leather seats, and climate control, plus more USB ports for the connected lifestyle. Under the hood, the Ranger Regular cab was offered with one engine choice: a 2.2-liter that provided 160 hp. The standard transmission was a 6-speed manual, and Ford offered it with a rear or a 4x4 version with a transfer case and high and low gears.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ford Ranger"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""Regular cab"",  ""overall-design"": [""facelift"", ""improved comfort"", ""smaller headlights"", ""chromed grille"", ""lifestyle truck""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""smaller"", ""upper placement""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD F-150 Super Cab,"Ford introduced the electric version of its best-selling truck F-150 in 2022 and took a different approach than its main competitors, such as the Chevrolet Silverado EV or the Rivian R1T. The F series was the best-selling model in the car industry, and Ford was proud of it. And yet, it didn't rush to create an electric version for it and waited until it was sure that it could provide a trustworthy work truck. While it shared most body panels with the version powered by an internal combustion engine, the F-150 Lightning featured a few particular differences. At the front, the massive grille between the headlights was completely blocked. Since there was no radiator behind it, it didn't make sense to have an actual grille. Instead, it was a panel with a horizontal sculptured slat in the middle that sported the blue-oval badge. The headlights were visually united via an LED strip that served as a daytime running light. From its sides, though, the pickup looked very similar to the rest of the F-150 range, with the two-step window line and the separated bed at the back. On the inside, the most significant change was for the infotainment screen. Ford installed a portrait-mode, massive 15.5"" touchscreen in the middle of the dashboard, replacing the regular center stack. Moreover, a 12"" instrument panel sat in front of the driver. Another major difference from the regular F-150 was the front trunk. Since it didn't have an engine there, Ford installed a 400 liters (14 cu-ft) luggage compartment ideal for groceries. In the same area, the carmaker placed four 110 V outlets to power various equipment on a construction site, for instance. The F-150 was available with two battery packs and a choice of two engines. In the most potent version, it provided a neck-hurting four-second acceleration from 0 to 60 mph (0-97 kph).",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""F-150 Lightning"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""full-size truck"",  ""overall-design"": [""massive"", ""trustworthy"", ""electric"", ""modern"", ""powerful""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""blocked"", ""horizontal"", ""sculptured"", ""blue-oval badge""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""united"", ""LED"", ""daytime running light""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Puma,"The name is old, this car is new and has high-hopes on the ever-expanding crossover market. It is meant to be loved by those who, 20 years ago, were teenagers and loved that little sport-coupe car from Ford. Except that, this time, the Puma is a crossover built in Eastern Europe after a 1.8 billion dollars investment, not a compact sports car built in Germany. Like the old Puma, which introduced a new design language (new-edge design), the new Puma starts a new generation of Ford electrified vehicles. It features a 48-volt architecture and it is a mild-hybrid with underfloor batteries. The new Ford Puma will have only one engine: the 1.0-liter EcoBoost with three cylinders and three power versions, starting with a 125 hp (same as the original Puma) and ending with a 155 hp version. Except for the base model, all the other trim levels will have a mild-hybrid function. The small, 4.2m (13.7 ft) crossover Puma is able to carry 456 liters (16 cu-ft) of luggage. But don't expect something extraordinary from the available passenger space. Five people will fit inside, but not for the longest drive of your life. Those who will share the backseat are not going to be very happy after a 2-hour drive. The new Puma also introduces the newest Ford infotainment system, SYNC 3. The system allows users to keep their phone in the wireless charging point, while they can browse or listen to music uninterrupted.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Puma"",  ""year"": ""new"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""modern"", ""sleek"", ""compact"", ""electrified"", ""stylish""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""bold""],    ""hood"": [""curved""],    ""headlights"": [""sharp""],    ""bumper"": [""sporty""],    ""wheel"": [""dynamic""],    ""doors"": [""streamlined""],    ""roof"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""diffusor"": [""functional""],    ""spoiler"": [""subtle""],    ""exhaust"": [""efficient""]  }}```"
FORD Bronco,"Ford made a bold move forward when it introduced the Raptor version for the 2022 Raptor and gave the car a much more powerful engine and a suspension setup that transformed the SUV into a fast off-road beast. The American brand already had a Raptor lineup, and all of them were highly capable on trails. Thus, the Bronco had a promise to keep, and Ford ensured its customers that they won't be disappointed. For starters, it improved the car's image with beefier, 35"" tires and a high-lift suspension. Its upgraded Dana heavy-duty axles, both front, and rear, led to a longer wheelbase, extended by 8.6 inches when compared to the rest of the Bronco range. In addition, a sturdy-looking aluminum shield installed under the front bumper protected the engine from hits and rocks, while the fenders received wider flares over the tires. Inside, there were minimal upgrades in terms of design, but a keen eye for detail could notice the new ring that surrounded the GOAT (Goes Over All Terrain) all-wheel drive selector placed on the center console. In addition, Ford installed a standard touch-screen infotainment atop the center stack, in line with the instrument cluster, which was also digital. Finally, a few carbon-fiber trims adorned the steering wheel, with the Raptor badge written on the lower spoke. Under the hood, the carmaker placed a new powerplant that offered more power and torque than the rest of the Bronco range. It was mated as standard to a ten-speed automatic transmission. Moreover, the transfer box was upgraded and offered a 3.06:1 gearing, made especially for rock crawling.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Bronco"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""larger wheelbase"",  ""overall-design"": [""bold"", ""powerful"", ""capable"", ""sturdy"", ""minimal""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""beefier""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""sturdy-looking"", ""aluminum shield"", ""front""],    ""wheel"": [""35\"" tires"", ""high-lift suspension"", ""Dana heavy-duty axles"", ""wider flares""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Explorer Electric,"Ford teamed up with Volkswagen and introduced the Explorer EV on the European market in the Spring of 2023, expanding its electric-powered vehicles lineup. The blue-oval badged brand was eager to get a bigger slice of the EV market that was rising all over the world. In Europe, it had few EVs to offer, and it needed more time to develop a new one from the ground up. Thus, it turned its attention to Volkswagen, which already had the MEB platform used for the ID.3, the ID.4, and the ID.Buzz. Sliced below the Mach E, the mid-size crossover Explorer was developed especially for European customers based on their driving habits. Design-wise, it looked bold, with a flat front fascia that, on a panel, sported Ford's blue-oval badge. That also concealed the radar for adaptive cruise control and other safety features. Between the upside-down L-shaped headlights and above the front panel, the automaker placed a black trim that sported the Explorer lettering on it. From its profile, the SUV-like shape was boxy, with flared wheel arches and massive 235/45 ZR 21 tires. Finally, at the back, the automaker installed another black trim with the car's nameplate lettering. Inside, it was completely a Ford, and its most distinctive feature was the portrait-mode touchscreen for the SYNC infotainment system. This tablet could slide up and down, covering a compartment behind it for valuable items. Another big storage area was in the center console that was spacious enough to fit a 15"" laptop inside. The high seatback front seats featured incorporated headrests and slightly bolstered areas. Fronting the driver was a second display for the instrument cluster. One interesting feature of the vehicle was that it didn't have any physical buttons on the dashboard, not even for the volume. In the back, there was room enough for three adults, and behind the split-folding bench seat was a 470 liters (16.6 cu-ft) trunk. The Explorer was available with either rear or all-wheel drive systems, both provided by Volkswagen and similar to this automaker's products. The same went with the battery packs available for the blue-oval badged crossover.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Explorer EV"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""mid-size crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""bold"", ""boxy"", ""sporty"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""flat"", ""front""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""upside-down L-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""flared"", ""massive""],    ""doors"": [""spacious""],    ""roof"": [""SUV-like""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Mustang MACH-E,"The Mustang Mach-E GT was not the kind of Mustang John Oros imagined in the mid-60s, but it was surely quicker than any muscle car from that era, even with five people on board. Back in 1964, JFK was in the office, and Mustang started the pony-car culture. Fast forward almost six decades, and there were still unanswered questions about JFK, but we knew that the battery-powered crossover was far away from what Ford imagined about a sports car when it introduced the 1964 ½ Mustang. Unlike the standard Mach-E, the GT sported a unique orange color and a few fine details that made it look different than its less-powered sibling. Its wide hexagonal black grille featured the iconic wild horse illuminated. The front bumper was different, while the apron featured the active grille shutters. A more aggressive splitter caught the air and diverted it to the sides through a pair of vents, creating an air curtain around the vehicle. The piano-black lower side sills made the profile look slimmer and lower to the ground from its sides. In the back, it was very similar to the regular Mustang Mach-E. Inside, Ford designers didn't bother to enhance the look too much. Sure, there were some GT stitchings around the cabin on the seats, steering wheel, center armrest, and the door sills. But the bolstered seats were almost the same, and there were no unique carbon-fiber trims as expected in such a performance vehicle. Under the skin, Ford installed two electric motors that provided 480 hp for both GT versions. The regular model offered 600 lb-ft (814 Nm) of torque, while the Performance version added 34 more lb-ft (46 Nm).",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mustang Mach-E GT"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""mid-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""quick"", ""unique"", ""aggressive"", ""slim"", ""low""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wide"", ""hexagonal"", ""black"", ""illuminated""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""different"", ""active grille shutters"", ""aggressive""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Mustang Mach 1,"The Mustang was a success in the U.S., but nobody knew what will happen in Europe, with so many other car-makers that could match its performances. Ford built the Mach 1 for the European market to offer the growling V8 sound and the thrills that come with it. Maybe it wasn't the fastest car in its category, but it surely was the one that had a long history in the back, matched only by the Porsche 911, which was way more expensive. The design team installed new air-intakes in the honeycomb mesh-grille to feed the engine and a taller grille on the apron to improve the cooling factor. The Mach 1 showed the big Brembo calipers through the specific, 19"" light-alloy wheels from its sides. A specific badge with the car's version name was installed on the front fenders and on the trunk lid. A specific aerodynamic package with a wing helped the car hit a higher cornering speed in the back. Four 4.5"" tailpipes (114.3 mm) improved the sound experience and the performance as well. The interior featured two bucket seats in the front and a 12"" digital instrument cluster. The dashboard design resembled the one on the original, 1969, Mach 1, with a raised area in front of the front passenger. For the infotainment, Ford installed its latest SYNC 3 device and a Bang&Olufsen sound system. Ford said that the Mach 1 was track-ready. Its stiffer suspension and wider tires made the car more planted to the road. The Magnaride adjustable dampers were tuned to improve grip and helped the car be one of Ford's best track car. The engine was carried over from Mustang Bullit, and it was paired as standard to a Tremec 6-speed manual with rev-match capability.

FORD Focus ST Wagon,"The hot-hatch revolution was on, and the power-war resembled the one from the muscle-car era in the U.S. But nevertheless, Ford had a brilliant idea to offer a hot-Focus as a station-wagon. Maybe it was the Volkswagen Golf that started the hot-hatch segment, but soon after its competition arrived. Opel/Vauxhall, Ford, Renault, Honda, Fiat, and MG joined the new trend. Most of them offered the most powerful versions exclusively on three-door bodyworks. Later on, they installed them on five-doors versions. But only Ford dared to put one of the most powerful engines it had on the Focus, in the station-wagon shape. All of a sudden, it was alone in its segment—the only hot-compact wagon on the market. While the front side was similar to the 5-door version with its wide-open black grille on the bumper and a small apron underneath. There were small differences from its sides compared to the regular Focus Wagon: its rocker-panels and bigger light-alloy wheels. In the rear, the twin-pipe exhaust poked in the middle of the bumper. Inside, the car meant business. Like its five-door sibling, the wagon version featured a specific ST dashboard with three additional gauges installed in a separate instrument cluster above the center stack. They were used for oil pressure, oil temperature, and boost. Despite being a station-wagon, it featured Recaro sport-bucket seats with embroiled ST lettering on their seatbacks. Under the hood, Ford installed an inline-four turbocharged gasoline engine. It provided 250 hp, which were sent to the front wheels. Ford offered an LSD on the options list.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ford Focus"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""hot-hatch"", ""station-wagon"", ""powerful"", ""wide-open grille"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wide-open"", ""black""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""bigger""],    ""bumper"": [""wide-open"", ""small apron"", ""twin-pipe exhaust""],    ""wheel"": [""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [""five-door""],    ""roof"": [""station-wagon""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""twin-pipe""]  }}```"
FORD Super Duty,"The Super Duty range was more of a truck than a pickup, but Ford still considered that it could fit it with car-like features and offered-it with a great comfort level for the upper trim levels. While the F-150 took most credits for the best-selling nameplate in the world, its heavy-duty brothers were the silent heroes for hard jobs. Ford united the F-250, the F-350, and above into one family named Super Duty. These two were competing against the HD series from GM 2500/3500, the RAM 2500/3500, and Nissan's Titan. From the exterior, the Super Duty showed a similar design to its well-known brother, the F-150, but taller. The Tremor F-250 featured simple wheels in the back, while its bigger brother F-350 was available with dual wheels in the back for heavier trailers. The C-shaped headlights flanked the broad and tall, body-colored grille with a black mesh design at the front. In the middle, it sported Ford's blue-oval badge. Inside, in the Lariat trim level, it showed a luxurious cabin, with wide front seats and a bench wide enough to comfortably fit four adults. Its numerous storage compartments would make a child happy to hide its toys and find them years later. For the 2022 model-year, Ford improved the infotainment system and upgraded it to the SYNC 4 unit with a 12"" touch-screen. Under the hood, Ford was still impressive with its V-8 engines or the turbo-diesel engine that was able to tow up to 37,000 lbs (16,782 kg) with gooseneck, or 24,200 lbs (10,976 kg) with conventional towing.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Super Duty"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""tall, heavy-duty"",  ""overall-design"": [""truck-like"", ""luxurious"", ""impressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""body-colored"", ""tall"", ""C-shaped"", ""black mesh""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""C-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""simple"", ""dual in the back""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Puma ST,"The car-manufacturers started to improve their offers in the crossover market with new or improved products. The Puma ST was just an example of fine engineering and sportiness offered by Ford. Despite the pandemic situation, Ford had a plan to improve its products by unveiling new vehicles or enhancing those that already existed on the market. The Ford Puma ST was the most potent version of the small crossover SUV. It was introduced in mid-September 2020. The Puma ST showed a different, more aggressive styling than its less-powered version. A new apron on the front, with a broad black grille and two side-pods for a fake air-intakes and fog lights, changed the car's look. A new radiator grille with honeycomb styling was installed by the manufacturer to enhance its sporty character, and a set of 19"" light-alloy wheels completed its image. For the interior, Ford installed a new digital instrument cluster with a 12.3"" display. The heated and bolstered Recaro bucket seats featured the ST logo printed on the back-seat. On the center stack, an 8"" touch-screen was fitted as standard. It was Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatible. The trunk was as large as for the rest of the range, with enough room for a set of golf clubs. For the drivetrain, Ford installed a turbocharged three-cylinder 1.5-liter unit, helped by an electric motor. The total output was 200 hp. The standard gearbox was a 6-speed manual, and the car featured a launch-control function that allowed the driver to get a 6.7 second time for the 0 to 100 kph (0-62 mph) run.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Puma ST"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""small crossover SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""sporty"", ""stylish"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""black"", ""honeycomb""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""new"", ""aggressive""],    ""bumper"": [""new""],    ""wheel"": [""19-inch"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Transit Custom,"The Ford Transit is long established name in Europe. Its roots are going back to 1953, when the first generation appeared based on the Ford Taunus platform, but it wasn't until 1965 when the Transit name was used as a brand model, and not a version. It was a good strategy that worked for four generation. Now, it looks like the blue-oval carmaker wants to divide the successful name Transit into a range of different vehicles. The Transit Custom is a smaller version of the big Transit, which became available as a light utility vehicle of up to 5 metric tons, with lot of body variations. The Transit Connect though, it is smaller and it is one of the best vans in its segment. The Transit Custom received a mid-cycle revision. The front look, the interior and the engine lineup was refreshed. On the front fascia, there are new headlights, new hexagonal grille and new bumper. The exterior design is part of the Ford's lineup unitary look, amarked by the hexagonal grille shape on all of its range, from the small Fiesta and up to the Transit Van. Under the hood, there are new engines. In the U.S., there was and still is available the 3.5-liter EcoBoost twin turbo, which offers 310 hp. ]A softer version of the same engine, without turbochargers. is now offered along with another new unit: the 2.0-liter TDCI EcoBlue that is shared with the Ford Ranger. It also gets a 10-speed automatic transmission. For the first time, the Transit Custom can be fitted with an all-wheel-drive system.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ford Transit Custom"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""smaller"",  ""overall-design"": [""unitary look"", ""refreshed front fascia""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""hexagonal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""new""],    ""bumper"": [""new""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Edge ST,"The blue-oval brand asked its sub-department Ford Performance to enhance the Edge lineup, and the result should have been better, but it wasn't quite so. Most carmakers had a special department that worked more on performance figures than on the fuel-efficiency or the trunk areas. It was the same with the Ford Performance, who had to work on the Edge lineup and squeezed more from it in terms of power and speed cornering. ST stood for Sport Technologies and defined the factory-tuned vehicles that could walk the talk. At the outside, the 2018 model sported a Mustang-inspired front fascia with blacked-out side intakes and a massive, hexagonal pattern mesh-grille. On the sides, the black rocker panels enhanced and visually lowered the ground clearance of the Edge. In the back, unique for the ST version, the carmaker installed a black diffuser and two rectangular exhausts. Inside, the sporty accents continued with the shining metallic pedals and the ST embroideries on the front seats' seatbacks. The Ford Performance logo, with blue and red lettering, adorned the door's sills. The driver had an ST-badged steering wheel loaded with plenty of buttons that could do anything for the infotainment system or the on-board computer. Two TFT screens flanked the center-mounted speedometer on the instrument panel and filled the driver with all the information required. Under the hood, Ford installed a tuned, turbocharged 2.7-liter V-6. It was the same used on the previous Edge Sport, but with 20 horsepower more and more torque as well. An eight-speed automatic transmission replaced the previously used six-speed auto.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Edge"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""aggressive"", ""muscular"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""hexagonal"", ""massive"", ""black""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""ST-embroidered"", ""metallic""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""black""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""rectangular""]  }}```"
FORD Raptor Ranger,"It had the name of its bigger brother F150 and the heart and veins (engine and gearbox) of its family-oriented sibling Edge. But the Ford Ranger Raptor stood proud on its own, muscular, feet. For many years, Ford enthusiasts were crying for a Raptor version. The 450 hp F150 Raptor was seen as the ultimate road-warrior and, when the road ended, it could go as fast as before. But in 2018 the Ranger Raptor was designed and launched for all the world. On the front, the Ranger Raptor featured the same design from the F150 Raptor with FORD letters embossed on the grille. The front-bumper was mounted on the frame for durability. There are some new headlights too. The fenders had flared wheel-arches to make room for the 285/70 R17 tires. same goes with the rear fenders. The Raptor was 1873 mm tall (73.7"") and 2180 mm (85.8"") wide. On the side, there were side-steps made of steel to be used as rock-sliders. And that was factory equipment! Inside, the Raptor was the same Ranger with few details to stand out. At the start of the vehicle, the TFT display between the dials inside the instrument cluster showed a ""Ford build for though"" animated gif and on the infotainment system, at start-up, it also shows the ""Raptor"" theme with a honeycomb grille in the background. The Raptor name also appeared on the seat-backs of the bolstered front seats. The technical part is far more than the spec list. The new Fox-racing allows a higher suspension-travel and cope better under hard punishment, on jumps and landings. The reinforced suspension overall was made for endurance.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ford Ranger Raptor"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""1873mm tall, 2180mm wide"",  ""overall-design"": [""muscular"", ""rugged"", ""aggressive"", ""durable"", ""athletic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""embossed"", ""FORD letters""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""new""],    ""bumper"": [""front-mounted"", ""durable""],    ""wheel"": [""flared wheel-arches""],    ""doors"": [""side-steps made of steel""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""reinforced""]  }}```"
FORD Maverick,"Ford introduced the 2022 Ford Maverick for the North American market in June 2021 as a compact pickup vehicle. The blue-oval brand aimed the new vehicle at those who thought a mid-size pickup was too big for their needs. Maverick was not only smaller, but it was also lighter and offered a better fuel efficiency than an F-150, for instance. Ford claimed that it could get up to 40 mpg-US (4.6 l/100 km). Ford adopted the form-follow-function design for the Maverick. Its squared-looking body confirmed it. The front fascia featured a black grille above the bumper crossed by a twin-slat chromed trim, which supported the Ford badge in the middle. A pair of squared, LED headlights with clear lenses for the turn signals resembled the bigger F-150 brother. The body-colored plastic bumper sported a black area on the lower side so that the driver wouldn't worry about minor scratches over it. On its sides, the four wide-open doors allowed an easy ingress and egress, while at the back, the 4.5 ft (1.4 m) wide bed could get a few sheets of plywood strapped together and leaned against the adjustable tailgate. Inside, the Maverick offered room for five on two seats at the front and a bench for three in the back. The dashboard was made out of recycled materials and sported an SYNC3 infotainment unit, which supported Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Its instrument cluster was completely digital. Between the front seats, Ford installed a rotary knob for selecting the driving programs. There was no gear stick around. Under the rear seats, the Maverick featured two storage areas for small items. Under the hood, Ford installed a hybrid system with a 2.5-liter gasoline engine and an electric motor paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The other option was a turbocharged 2.0-liter unit paired with the same gearbox but without an electric motor.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Maverick"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""squared-looking"", ""form-follow-function"", ""lightweight"", ""fuel-efficient""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black"", ""twin-slat chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""squared"", ""LED"", ""clear lenses""],    ""bumper"": [""body-colored"", ""plastic"", ""black area""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""wide-open""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Ka+ Active,"While the customers' preferences started to shift toward the SUV and crossover section, Ford found a new way to make its vehicle more attractive by lifting them, like the 2018 Ka+ Active. Ford developed the third generation of the Ka on the same platform as the Fiesta, dropping the previously used Fiat 500 base. Then, it added another pair of doors and renamed-it Ka+. It was a good addition for the European model that was easier to fit four adults inside while the car's exterior remained minimal. In 2018, Ford unveiled the crossover version for its smallest four-door car available. With striking color and black plastic molds around its bodywork and wheel-arches, the Ka+ Active was a vehicle that stood apart in the city-segment. Apart from the Dacia Sandero Stepway, it was alone in the segment. Ford added a unique set of wheels and roof-rails. The KA+ featured a high-mounted trapezoidal grille and large, swept-back headlamps. Ford increased the height by 23 mm (0.9"") and made it look like a crossover vehicle, able to climb over curbs and tackle some unpaved roads. Inside, the Ka+ was already capable enough to accommodate four adults up to 2 m (6.56"") high, which was remarkable in its class. Maybe they didn't sit comfortably, but still, it was a great achievement for its segment. Ford's designers enhanced the Active version's interior with a unique steering wheel design and brown stitching. For the infotainment system, the carmaker installed an SYNC3 infotainment system with a 6.5"" screen. Under the hood, the Ka+ Active featured a choice of two engines paired to a standard 5-speed manual.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ka+ Active"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""minimal"", ""striking"", ""crossover"", ""unique"", ""capable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""high-mounted"", ""trapezoidal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""large"", ""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""unique set""],    ""doors"": [""four-door""],    ""roof"": [""roof-rails""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Territory,"The Ford Territory was built in China and it was developed together by Ford Motor Company and Jianling Motor Corporation. It was based on a Chinese SUV and sold only in China. Doing car-business in China means that the manufacturers should work together with a local car-manufacturer most of the time. Apart from a few premium car-makers, most of the mass-production vehicle brands have an alliance with a local manufacturer since it is more affordable to built there than to transport there. Ford had a partner which already had developed their own product, the Yusheng 330. The Territory had a different front fascia than the Yusheng 330. It features headlights that resembled other Ford models and a grille with a 3D mesh on it. The floating roof design concept was adopted well by the American car-maker for the Chinese market. In the rear, the design concept of the headlights was adopted for the taillights. Under the rear bumper, there was a fake splitter that was complemented by a dual exhaust system. Inside, the dashboard was re-designed by Ford following modern concepts of ergonomy. It featured a large infotainment display on the center stack and a TFT display for the instrument cluster. The drivetrain featured a 4G15 gasoline engine, which was a further development based upon a Mitsubishi 1.5-liter engine. It was mated as standard with a 6-speed manual gearbox and was offered with an option for a 6-speed automatic.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ford Territory"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""modern"", ""sleek"", ""stylish"", ""ergonomic"", ""distinctive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sleek""],    ""grille"": [""3D mesh""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""resembling other Ford models""],    ""bumper"": [""fake splitter"", ""dual exhaust""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""floating""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual""]  }}```"
FORD Ranger Tremor,"Ford put its vast experience into building pickups and produced the Tremor as a special version for the Ranger in Europe, a vehicle built for hard off-road adventures but capable enough to carry long and heavy items. The European Ranger proved to be a hit among its customers. Still, some of them didn't need it just to drive around towns and farms. They needed to do some serious off-road and didn't want to browse around specialized shops to get their truck done. But Ford knew that, and that's why its engineers developed the Tremor and Wildtrack duo, where the Tremor was prepared to tackle water streams and difficult situations while still being able to carry heavy loads in the back. Its rugged look was a statement of ""I can do anything,"" and Ford promised that it was true. The enlarged wheel fenders and the arch moldings covered the wide all-terrain tires that covered the 17"" light-alloy wheels. In addition, cast-aluminum side steps provided not only an easier ingress and egress to the car but also protected the bodywork from getting hit by rocks. The Tremor also featured a long-leg tubular sports bar at the back of the cabin and, as an option, a flexible rack system that allowed customers to load long items in the back and still be able to close the tailgate. This rack could sustain up to 80 kg (176 lbs) of loads while moving or 250 kg (551 lbs) static. Inside, the automaker installed bucket seats with bolstered areas at the front and a bench profiled for two in the back. Like its LTD Ranger sibling, the Tremor featured a dual-screen dashboard, with a TFT for the instrument panel and a portrait-mode touchscreen for the SYNC infotainment system. In addition, Ford installed an overhead switch pack for up to six inputs for winches, light bars, and other accessories. Powering the whole monster was Ford's 2.0-liter turbo-diesel that developed 205 PS (202 hp) and a ten-speed automatic transmission. The 30 mm (1.3"") wider track and 26 mm (1.2"") increased ground clearance compared to the standard Ranger made the Tremor an excellent off-road warrior while still being able to carry all the loads to the camping site.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ranger"",  ""year"": ""N/A"",  ""size"": ""Mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""Rugged"", ""Capable"", ""Rugged look"", ""Enlarged wheel fenders"", ""Arch moldings""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""17\"" light-alloy wheels"", ""Wide all-terrain tires""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""Dual exhaust system""],    ""bumper"": [""Front and rear heavy-duty bumpers""],    ""roof"": [""Long-leg tubular sports bar"", ""Flexible rack system""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""doors"": [""Cast-aluminum side steps""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""Dual exhaust system""]  }}```"
FORD Transit Connect Wagon,"Ford refreshed the Transit Connect Wagon in 2018 and unveiled it at the Chicago Auto Show, a vehicle that combined the practicality of a minivan with the fuel efficiency of a mid-sized sedan. The Transit was the most popular light utility vehicle around the world, and Ford took advantage of that and used the same nameplate for this smaller MPV. While it was also available as a delivery van, it was also offered for regular people as a family hauler. The refreshed version came on the North American shores with enough features and amenities to make it a good choice for fleets and families alike. The North American version of the Transit Connect Wagon was slightly different than its European sibling. At the front, the automaker installed the badge on the broad black grille, while on the Old Continent, that was mounted on the hood. Also, the lower bumper featured a different design, with a distinct apron that incorporated a grille flanked by the fog lamps' scoops. From its profile, the ascending beltline started from the flared wheel arches and went towards the back of the vehicle, underlining the exposed rail for the sliding doors. Finally, at the back, the automaker offered either a fridge-door opening system or a wide tailgate. Inside there was room for seven passengers, depending on the wheelbase option. The shortest version could accommodate just five occupants. It offered interesting features for its class, especially for the safety systems, such as the Automatic Emergency Braking that included the Pre-Collision Assist with Pedestrian Detection. The technology offered by Ford in that MPV was also noticeable in the infotainment unit with the Sync3 system that featured a 6.5"" touch-screen. Under the hood, Ford installed either a 2.0-liter naturally-aspirated, direct fuel-injected gasoline unit or a 1.5-liter turbocharged and paired both of them with an eight-speed automatic transmission that drove the front wheels.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Transit Connect Wagon"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""mid-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""practical"", ""fuel-efficient"", ""family-friendly"", ""distinct"", ""safety-focused""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""black""],    ""hood"": [""mounted""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""different design"", ""distinct apron""],    ""wheel"": [""flared""],    ""doors"": [""sliding""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD Ranger Wildtrak,"Ford expanded the European Ranger lineup with the addition of the Wildtrack X and Tremor versions, which were designed and engineered to tackle hard offroad situations. While SUVs and crossovers were already mainly built for asphalt and city traffic, Ford used its off-road experience to create variants that were able to go through mud and snow with ease. And when that task was accomplished, the automaker added rock crawling as another trial. And it won that one too. While the regular Ranger double-cab was still capable enough to go through unpaved roads and even difficult off-road situations, the Wildtrack X took things to another level. With a 30 mm (1.3"") wider track and a 26 mm (1.2"") higher ground clearance than its regular Ranger sibling, the Wildtrack X offered a ferocious look. Its front bumper with fixed hooks was impressive when seen in the rearview mirror. From its sides, the 17"" light-alloy wheels wearing large 265/70 All-Terrain tires were just a few hints that this version is up for everything. In addition, the cast-aluminum side steps protected the bodywork from stones and underbody hits while rock crawling. Unlike the Tremor, the Wildtrack X featured a nicer interior with contrast accents on the mixed-upholstered (leather and fabric) seats. Still, it featured the same TFT display inside the instrument cluster and the portrait-mode touchscreen for the SYNC infotainment system. At the back, Ford installed a bench wide enough to carry up to three adults. Powering the whole monster was Ford's 2.0-liter turbo-diesel that developed 205 PS (202 hp) and a ten-speed automatic transmission. The suspension was revised and featured high-performance Bilstein shock absorbers in all corners.",FORD,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ford Ranger"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""double-cab"",  ""overall-design"": [""off-road"", ""ferocious"", ""impressive"", ""nicer"", ""powerful""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""front"", ""fixed hooks"", ""impressive""],    ""wheel"": [""17\"" light-alloy"", ""large 265/70 All-Terrain tires""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
FORD E-Tourneo,"The brand-new Ford E-Tourneo Courier represents another stepping stone in the electrification path for American automaker. The idea of revitalizing a model that has been around for approximately two decades through an electric powertrain may reveal that Ford's goal to achieve zero emission across all vehicle sales in Europe by 2035 is attainable. Being amongst the ten all-electric models Ford offers for the European market by 2024, the new Tourneo also has the option of a traditional gasoline EcoBoost engine. This approach from Ford is meant to satisfy the needs of a wider variety of customers, so the brand is trying to match their catalog with the diverse needs of their clients. The E-Tourneo provides the flexibility of both 11 kW AC and 100 kW DC charging capabilities. A standard overnight AC charge, covering the range from 10 to 100 percent, takes approximately 5.7 hours. When utilizing a DC fast charger, customers can add an impressive 87 km (54 miles) range in just ten minutes and charge from 10 to 80 percent in under 35 minutes. Although it has an SUV look, the Ford is made to be as economically viable as possible, so practicability is the main focal point of the car, trading aspects like off-road capability and premium interiors for a more efficient powertrain and extra cargo space. Carrying five passengers and their luggage should be easy for the new E-Tourneo as it has 44% more cargo space than the previous model. To this space, the car has an additional 44-liter frunk, a trademark of electric vehicles. The 134-hp electric motor does an excellent job with the car's propulsion, being more than enough to help the Ford make its way through traffic, even when loaded at total capacity. For better use, there are three selectable drive modes, Normal, Eco, and Slippery, meant to adapt the car to all driving conditions and to adjust according to the driver's needs. On the exterior, the car can be recognized as a Ford from far away due to the signature diamond grill that spans between the massive headlights of the car. Also connecting the headlights is the light bar that underlines the car's rough edges, complementing the futuristic look. The standard look of the vehicle is more than enough when we talk about the practical identity of the car, meant to be useful, not luxurious.

GEELY Emgrand EC7,"The Chinese automaker Geely tried to create an upscale brand under its umbrella and launched the Embrand brand in 2009, together with its first product, the EC7. Geely was new to this segment and didn’t know how to approach it. But it tried its best, hiring international suppliers both for vehicle parts and for the assembly lines. The result was known as the Emgrand EC7, but since the parent company was better known in some markets, it was also sold under the Geely marque. The 2009 EC7 was the model’s first generation, and it was both exported and assembled outside China in Russia, Pakistan, Uruguay, and Iran. The automaker worked together with Mitsubishi when it developed the Emgrand EC7, but in terms of design, the result was nothing out of the ordinary. Its front fascia featured a high-mounted grille crossed by four horizontal slats, which were either black or chromed, depending on the version and options. The headlights were angular-shaped and slightly swept-back on the sides, sporting corner-mounted turn signals and projector-beam headlamps. Depending on the version, the lower bumper sported an apron with a grille flanked by two scoops for fog lamps when fitted. From its profile, the EC7 sedan tried to look modern with a cab-rearward design despite being a front-wheel-driven vehicle. The sculptured creases on the door panels and the ascending belt line made it look sporty but not very aggressive. Finally, at the back, the deck was short, and corner-mounted taillights flanked the trunk lid. Inside, the cabin was dominated by cheap plastic surfaces on the dashboard, door cards, and other areas. Still, the overall design was original, especially for the instrument cluster. There, Geely installed two large dials for the speedometer and rev counter that flanked a rectangular TFT display that showed data from the car’s onboard computer. Above it, in an elliptically-shaped LCD, the automaker added the fuel level indicator, the coolant temperature, and the door-closing status. Geely offered the Emgrand EC7 with different options, depending on the market. Some customers could get the car with a GPS navigation system placed on the center stack, with an SD-card reader to play music or load maps. At the front, the automaker installed regular bucket seats with little to no side bolstering, made mostly for comfort, while in the back, a bench seat could accommodate two people for longer travels and three just for short jaunts. Under the hood, Geely installed improved Mitsubishi gasoline engines to propel the vehicle. A 1.5-liter four-banger moved the base version, while the top-spec version came fitted with a 1.8-liter engine under the EC715 or the EC718 nameplate, respectively. Power was sent to the front wheels only via a standard five-speed manual transmission, while a CVT with manual override was available for the most potent version.",GEELY,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Emgrand EC7"",  ""year"": ""2009"",  ""size"": ""mid-sized sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""modern"", ""sporty"", ""original""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""high-mounted"", ""horizontal slats"", ""black or chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angular-shaped"", ""swept-back"", ""projector-beam""],    ""bumper"": [""lower grille"", ""fog lamp scoops""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured creases"", ""ascending belt line""],    ""roof"": [""cab-rearward design""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
GEELY Galaxy,"The Chinese automaker Geely worked hard to develop the Galaxy L6, which became one of its most important products on the market. Despite being released during the electric-car revolution, this model was powered by internal combustion engines. Still, it offered more than enough features and amenities to be attractive to mid-level executives for both company and family use. While other automakers tried to change their design language, Geely followed the former bio-design styling but improved as much as it could. That was noticeable on the Galaxy L6, which was penned with waved shapes and curved lines on the car's bodywork. At the front, the automaker installed a slim light strip that crossed the car's width and emerged into the headlights and the lower-mounted daytime running lights. On the lower bumper, the automaker installed a trapezoidal-shaped air intake that helped to cool the engine, flanked by side scoops that mimicked vents. From its profile, the Galaxy L6 showed a crossover stance with tall door panels and narrow windows. The curved roof line ended at the back by a sloped rear windscreen. Despite the car's overall shape, it wasn't a hatchback but a three-box sedan with a short and sloped down deck. The taillights mounted on the rear fascia boasted dynamic lights for brakes and turn signals. To further create a luxury image, the automaker installed a pair of fake chromed exhausts at the lower part of the bumper. For a sportier look, customers could order the car with either 18 or 19"" light alloy wheels. Inside, Geely created a spacious cabin fitted with high-quality materials in the main areas and cheaper ones for the hidden ones. The hexagonal-shaped steering wheel looked slightly unusual but provided enough grip for the driver thanks to its thick crown. The automaker created the Galaxy L6 with a completely digital dashboard, with a TFT fronting the driver and a touchscreen placed atop the center stack. Between the front seats, the automaker placed a tall center console that featured a few storage places, including a wireless charger for mobile phones just underneath the armrest. In the back, there was enough room for three adults seated on the 60/40 split-folding bench. On the upper trim levels, the Galaxy L6 boasted a leather-wrapped interior and a panoramic roof. Geely built the Galaxy L6 on the same e-CMA platform used for the Galaxy L7. Power came from a PHEV system. The gasoline unit was a 163 PS (161 HP) 1.5-liter turbocharged engine that was helped by a 146 PS (144 HP) electric motor for a total of 390 PS (385 HP). The carmaker offered an options for two lithium-ion battery packs of 9.11 kWh or 19.1 kWh for an all-electric range that varied between 48 and 105 km (30 – 65 miles), respectively.",GEELY,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Galaxy L6"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""mid-size sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""waved shapes"", ""curved lines"", ""crossover stance"", ""luxury image"", ""sporty look""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""curved""],    ""grille"": [""trapezoidal-shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""slim"", ""emerged"", ""dynamic""],    ""bumper"": [""lower-mounted"", ""trapezoidal-shaped"", ""fake chromed""],    ""wheel"": [""18 or 19\"" light alloy""],    ""doors"": [""tall door panels"", ""narrow windows""],    ""roof"": [""curved"", ""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""fake chromed""],    ""interior"": [""spacious"", ""high-quality materials"", ""leather-wrapped"", ""panoramic""]  }}```"
GEELY LC,"After successfully introducing the LC lineup in 2008 and gaining popularity as the first Chinese automaker able to produce a vehicle with a five-star rating in the local crash test, Geely dared more and introduced a crossover version for this model and named LC Cross, although it had different names on various markets, such as the Panda. Geely was a big manufacturer of small vehicles, and its reputation grew after it launched the LC in 2008. Two years later, in 2010, it got a five-star rating on local crash-test results, rocketing the car's sales. Still, customers wanted something that they could use on unpaved roads and park over curbs. So, in 2011, Geely introduced a ""SUV-izied"" version for it, the LC Cross or Panda Cross, depending on the market. Unlike many other automakers who just jacked up the suspension, put unpainted clads on the bodywork, and called it a day, Geely came up with unusual ideas for this small-sized segment. The car's exterior featured the same rounded headlights but with projector headlamps inside them. Moreover, while the upper section of the bumper sported body colors, the lower one was black, unpainted, and scratch-resistant and featured two round fog lamps. Finally, to further emphasize the crossover stance, the automaker added a light-gray underbody shield underneath the bumper's middle section. From its profile, the egg-shaped vehicle featured a jacked-up suspension, like most other crossovers from its class. In addition, a set of black clads adorned the doors, although those were mostly useful against shopping carts. But the most intriguing part of the vehicle was on the back. There, Geely installed a bumper with an unpainted lower section and a full-size spare wheel mounted on the tailgate. This was an unusual solution. Inside, the automaker kept the same simple lines of the dashboard with rounded shapes on the center stack and an instrument cluster filled with a large speedometer and a smaller tachometer on its left. In addition, a small LCD showed the odometer. On the center stack, the automaker installed a stereo and the turning knobs for the HVAC. The regular seats carried over from the standard Panda (or LC) featured cloth upholstery with contrasting colors. At the same time, the rear seats benefited from the same treatment, and the seatback could fold in a single piece. Finally, the trunk was slightly larger than in its non-crossover version since the spare wheel wasn't there anymore. The car's underpinning featured the same 1.3-liter or 1.5-liter gasoline engines, depending on the market, as the Geely LC and both versions were paired with a five-speed manual that sent the power to the front wheels. Unlike its street-oriented sibling, the LC Cross featured different springs and suspension struts that helped the car get a higher ground clearance.",GEELY,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""LC Cross (Panda)"",  ""year"": ""2011"",  ""size"": ""small-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""rounded"", ""crossover"", ""unpainted"", ""jacked-up"", ""simple""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""rounded"", ""projector""],    ""bumper"": [""two-tone"", ""scratch-resistant"", ""underbody shield""],    ""wheel"": [""full-size spare mounted on tailgate""],    ""doors"": [""adorned with black clads""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
GENESIS G90,"Hyundai introduced the first refresh for the Genesis G90 range in 2021, three years since the model's introduction on the U.S. market, and that change affected the exterior, the cabin, and the drivetrain. Genesis G90 was the flagship model of the Korean carmaker, which was the upscale brand for the Hyundai-Kia group. It offered the most luxurious ride for its customers, but it had to go through a facelift process every three years, just like its siblings. We might say that the 2022 model year, introduced in late 2021, represented the most important refresh for the luxurious model. Its headlights were completely changed, not just reshaped. Instead of one headlamp, it featured two thin LED lines divided by a horizontal slat. At the front, the grille kept the diamond shape, but the lower bumper received bigger air intakes. On the sides, the same sculptured line started from the front fenders and ran across the bodywork towards the rear, in a sloped curve ended at the taillights. Inside, the carmaker offered a choice of five combinations for the Korean domestic market: Obsidian Black/Mono-Tone, Bordeaux Brown/Obsidian Black Two-Tone, Glacier White/Urban Brown Two-Tone, Modern Gray/Galaxy Black Two-Tone, and Dune Beige/Velvet Burgundy Two-Tone. Furthermore, the dashboard received a completely new design with a full-digital instrument panel and a second display integrated above the center stack. In addition, a dial replaced the gear selector on the center console. While the exterior and the interior went through an extensive workout, the drivetrain was shrunk to just one engine option, a 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged V6 powerplant paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission that sent the power to the rear or in all corners.",GENESIS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Genesis G90"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""luxurious"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""sophisticated"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""refined""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""diamond-shaped"", ""prominent"", ""modern""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""thin LED lines"", ""distinctive"", ""modern""],    ""bumper"": [""bigger air intakes"", ""aggressive""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
GENESIS G70,"Hyundai introduced the G70 as a premium contender on the U.S. market and built it on the same platform as the Kia Stinger. In 2021, the Korean carmaker unveiled a refreshed version of the G70 and added more features to the sport sedan. It competed in the mid-size sedan premium market, even though its brand name was not as famous as its competitors'. Designed by the German Peter Schreyer, the G70 represented one of the most ambitious Hyundai projects. So when he re-worked the 2021 model, he enhanced the LED quad-signature thin lamps at the front. In addition, the vast, diamond-shaped grille sported a black color for the sport trim levels, creating a more aggressive look for the car. On the front fenders, behind the wheel arches, the carmaker added fake exhaust vents, but their plastic cover looked odd and resembled the B-shaped grilles from a Bentley. At the back, the oval-shaped tips over the quad exhausts looked similar to those installed by the British luxury car as well. The lower part of the rear bumper, on the other hand, looked unusual with its mat, unpainted plastic area. Inside, Genesis worked hard to provide a luxurious yet sporty ambiance. The sport bucket seats at the front provided a high-bolstered area. At the same time, the tall center console featured an aluminum trim with the rotary dial for the infotainment system and the gear-selector. Its leather-clad interior provided a luxurious image, especially with the optional quilted pattern. A floating-design 10.25"" touch-screen adorned the top of the center stack. Genesis installed two analog dials and two gauges in the instrument cluster for the driver, plus a color LCD between them. Under the hood, the carmaker reduced the engine versions to just three: two turbocharged gasoline units and a turbo-diesel. Genesis offered the latter, especially for European customers.",GENESIS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""G70"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""mid-size sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""ambitious"", ""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""aggressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""vast"", ""diamond-shaped"", ""black""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""quad-signature"", ""thin""],    ""bumper"": [""unusual"", ""mat"", ""plastic""],    ""wheel"": [""fake exhaust vents"", ""odd"", ""Bentley-like""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""oval-shaped"", ""quad"", ""similar to British luxury car""],    ""interior"": [""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""floating-design"", ""10.25\"" touch-screen"", ""quilted pattern"", ""aluminum trim""],    ""center-console"": [""tall"", ""aluminum trim"", ""rotary dial"", ""gear-selector""],    ""instrument-cluster"": [""analog dials"", ""color LCD""]  }}```"
GENESIS G80,"When Toyota needed a luxury brand, it created Lexus. When Honda and Nissan went for the premium segment, Acura and Infiniti showed up. Now, Hyundai is doing the same with the Genesis brand. That's why nobody should have been surprised by the 2020 Genesis G80. It is a completely new model, on a new platform. From a distance, it might be mistaken with an Infiniti M model, but on a closer look, the pentagonal grille and quad-headlights will tell a different story. Maybe it is not that original from the design point of view, but the same words were said about Lexus when it started. The side dropping line might remember someone from the lines of a second-generation Mercedes-Benz CLS. That said, as an original design cue, the double horizontal lines from the headlights and taillights are making a statement. The roofline is kind of like the one on the Kia Stinger, which is fine since it is another vehicle from the Hyundai-Kia group. The interior is very luxurious, with a big, 14.5” infotainment screen in the middle of the dashboard. For a better feeling of space, the A-pillars are slimmer, to offer a panoramic view. Since the G80 has the same platform as the new Genesis SUV GV80, we can expect a 2.5-liter turbocharged gasoline engine and a 3.5-liter V6 turbocharged unit.",GENESIS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Genesis G80"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""elegant"", ""sophisticated""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""slimmer A-pillars""],    ""grille"": [""pentagonal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""quad""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""reminiscent of Kia Stinger""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
GENESIS GV70,"Genesis opened a new chapter in its history with the introduction of the GV70, a vehicle that will compete against BMW X3, Audi Q5, and other premium vehicles in the SUV-compact segment. Hyundai was relentless and hit the premium market with its up-scale brand Genesis. Even though it wasn't completely successful with all of its lineups, it still going strong against the big premium car-makers. The GV70 was based on a rear-wheel-drive platform, most probably carried-over from the G70 sedan. With a breathtaking design, the GV70 doesn't resemble any other car on the market. It also came with very fresh ideas, such as the light-alloy-wheels pattern, which looked dimpled like a golf-ball. At the front, the GV70 featured a complicated, five-sided grille that looked like chainmail. From the sides, the designers took a different approach with different lines and curved surfaces. Some might say that it's the idea of ""flame surfacing"" imagined by Chris Bangle two decades ago. The hatchback-style rear end with a curved tailgate and D-pillar emphasized the GV70's sporty look. On top of that, a big roof-spoiler completed the image. In the back, there were two versions for the exhausts. One was with two round pipes, and the other was with two vertical ones with a flat pentagonal shape. The interior followed an elliptic theme design repeated on the dashboard panel, doors, and glove compartment latch. Since it was a car designed for the connectivity age, the designers installed a widescreen for the infotainment system, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatible. The luxurious cabin offered a similar room as in the G70 sedan, but with more legroom and higher seating position.",GENESIS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""GV70"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""breathtaking"", ""sporty"", ""luxurious"", ""up-scale"", ""fresh""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""complicated"", ""five-sided"", ""chainmail""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""light-alloy"", ""dimpled""],    ""doors"": [""elliptic"", ""luxurious""],    ""roof"": [""hatchback-style"", ""curved"", ""big""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""big""],    ""exhaust"": [""round"", ""vertical"", ""pentagonal""]  }}```"
GENESIS G70 Shooting Brake,"Hyundai had an ambitious plan to enter the premium car segment with the Genesis brand and made its first step on the European market with the G70 Shooting-brake. The idea of a premium brand was not new for the Korean brand. While the first production vehicle that sported this brand was introduced in 2008 as an upmarket model for Hyundai, the real change was in 2015 when the carmaker launched the G90 wearing the Genesis Motor badge. In 2021 the carmaker introduced the station-wagon-shaped version named G70 Shooting-brake. A car that left the U.S. customers with tears in their eyes since it wasn't available in North America. Peter Schreyer was responsible for the G70's design, and he also penned the lines of the Shooting-brake version. He was inspired by former European carmakers who used the same bodywork concept: a station wagon with a raked-forward tailgate. The car's front featured the same diamond-shaped broad grille and the swept-back headlights extended over the front fenders. Up to the B-pillar, it was the same G70 but changed behind that. Schreyer extended the car's roof up to the rear wheels, and then it added a sloped-down tailgate with a floating-like roof spoiler. The rear doors were the same as on the G70 sedan. It was only one mm (0.04"") longer than its sibling. Inside, the G70 Shooting-brake shared most of its parts with its three-box brother. It used the same elegant yet sporty interior with high-quality materials and an infotainment unit able to connect with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The main difference was in the back, where the carmaker installed a split-folding 40/20/40 bench to expand the trunk area. Under the hood, the new version kept all the engines from its four-door sibling but adapted for the European market.",GENESIS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""G70 Shooting-brake"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""elegant"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""diamond-shaped"", ""broad""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""rear"", ""same as sedan""],    ""roof"": [""extended"", ""sloped-down"", ""floating-like""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
GENESIS GV60,"Hyundai's premium brand Genesis introduced its first full-electric crossover in 2022 for the 2023 model year, marking its first step into the EV era. The Korean automaker invested a lot of money to develop a full-electric platform, and it had to sell more vehicles with higher profit margins to get its money back. Thus, apart from the Ioniq 5 and the EV6 from Kia. While these two electric vehicles created a strong image for the automaker, the GV60 added a premium touch and a luxurious feeling for its customers. Genesis created a new design for the hatchback crossover vehicle. Unlike the Ioniq 5, the GV60 sported shaved edges and rounded shapes. Its front fascia was dominated by the broad black grille from the dam. Still, that was mostly blocked since the car didn't need that much cooling area. On the upper side of the bumper, the carmaker installed the headlights and, above them, the daytime running lights. All of them were fitted with LEDs. A unique feature of the vehicle was the clamshell design for the hood, which opened altogether with the upper sides of the fenders. Inside, the car featured luxurious and technological amenities. The only traditional elements were the seats and the two-spoke steering wheel. There were no side mirrors but cameras and small screens inside the cockpit. In front of the driver, Genesis installed a wide screen that integrated the instrument panel and the infotainment system. Between the front occupants, the automaker placed a center console that housed a crystal ball, which was the gear selector, and a couple of cupholders. For the drivetrain, Genesis offered a choice of four drivetrains ranging from 228 to 490 hp, with one or two motors driving all wheels.",GENESIS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""GV60"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""hatchback crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""luxurious"", ""rounded"", ""technological""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""black""],    ""hood"": [""clamshell""],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""upper"", ""dominated""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
GENESIS GV80,"2021 Genesis GV80 Hyundai's luxury brand Genesis launched its first SUV in 2020 for the 2021 model year, and it tried to compete with big brands like Cadillac, Volvo, and Mercedes-Benz, to name just a few. Since Hyundai didn't have vast experience in creating luxury cars, it hired big names from the automotive industry, such as Peter Schreyer or Luc Donckerwolke, as chief creative officer. Previously, he worked for other big European brands like Bentley, Lamborghini, and Audi within the Volkswagen Group. In 2008, the Korean luxury brand took off, and in 2015, it launched its first production vehicle, the G90, a four-door sedan. But that was not enough on a market that asked for more SUVs and crossovers. As a result, in January 2020, the automaker introduced the GV80 based on the Hyundai-Kia M3 rear-wheel-drive platform that was used for other Genesis sedans. On the exterior, Genesis created a unique design of the front fascia with its quad-lamp design and the big, crest-like grille between them. The bumper featured a smaller, lower air intake adorned by a chicken-wire-style pattern and flanked by a pair of side scoops that diverted the air around the bodywork. From its profile, the GV80 impressed with its sloped-down roof line and the ascending window line that raised behind the rear doors. A pair of fake vents decorated the front fenders, while the sculptured doors created the image of a taller vehicle. At the back, the tailgate featured a raked forward window and a roof spoiler mounted on its upper side. The taillights were extended from the quarter panel onto the tailgate's lower panel. The leather-wrapped interior expressed a high level of luxury. Genesis offered the car with two rows of seats as standard, while a third row placed in the trunk area was available. Thanks to Luk Donckerwolke's experience with other luxury brands, the GV80 featured diamond-stitched leather on the seats and a wide, wood-trimmed center console that housed the gear selector, two cup holders, and a storage compartment under the center armrest. Inside the instrument cluster, Genesis installed a wide speedometer on the left that also contained the fuel gauge at its bottom and two displays on its right. The one in the middle was for information gathered from the onboard computer, while the right dial showed the image from rear-view cameras installed on the left and right of the vehicle, depending on which direction the driver activated the turn signal. There was enough room in the back for three adult-sized passengers, thanks to the low transmission tunnel. The third row was mostly for kids since it provided very limited legroom and headroom, but it was there if someone needed it. The Korean automaker offered the GV80 SUV with a choice of two turbocharged engines paired with a standard eight-speed automatic transmission. The base model had a 2.5-liter inline-four powerplant that produced 300 hp (304 PS), while the other option was a 3.5-liter V6 that produced 375 hp (380 PS). For selected markets, Genesis offered a three-liter inline-six turbo-diesel that sent 274 hp (278 PS) to the wheels. All versions were fitted with an all-wheel-drive system.",GENESIS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Genesis GV80"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""midsize luxury SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""unique"", ""sloped"", ""sculptured"", ""impressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""big"", ""crest-like""],    ""hood"": [""sculptured""],    ""headlights"": [""quad-lamp""],    ""bumper"": [""smaller"", ""adorned"", ""chicken-wire-style""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured"", ""taller""],    ""roof"": [""sloped"", ""raked"", ""spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof-mounted""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
GMC Sierra,"GMC has completed its off-road-oriented lineup of trucks with the introduction of the 2024 Sierra HD AT4X and its even more rugged sibling, the HD AT4X AEV. Both versions were launched simultaneously in spring 2023, throwing the gauntlet toward what RAM and Ford already had on their offers. But GMC waited a little bit more, and the result was astonishing. The big rig was able to pull anything with wheels on it, and it could also provide comfort and a ""get out of my way"" appearance. The GMC Sierra 2500 HD was already a big truck on the road, but it was mainly built for construction sites or to pull a heavy load on a trailer behind it. But the AT4X version came with an enhanced look that boasted a huge black grille up front, a black bumper, and two exposed red towing hooks. The headlights were carried over from its less-hardcore off-road sibling, the 2500 HD. From its side, the high ground clearance was noticeable, and so were the 35"" MT tires mounted on the 18"" alloy wheels. On its sides, to ease reaching out inside the bed, the automaker installed side steps on the rear quarter panels. But all that rugged exterior look was hiding a wide and spacious cabin for five people. Boasting massaging front seats, a full-grain leather-wrapped interior, and a Bose sound system, it was the truck aimed for those ready to travel long distances toward their next camping location. The dashboard was fitted with a 13.4"" touchscreen for the infotainment system and a 12.3"" instrument panel in front of the driver.

GMC Terrain,"GMC refreshed the second generation of the Terrain SUV in 2021 for the 2022 model-year and gave it some restyled lines and turbocharged engines. After four years since the introduction of Terrain's second generation, GMC came with a mid-life cycle refresh for its compact SUV. The new version brought the AT trim level, which was focused more on off-road abilities. Even though the Terrain was not an off-road vehicle, it could handle some rough areas, mud, and snow. On the outside, the 2021 Terrain showed a different front fascia, with taller headlights and C-shaped daytime running lights. Its twin LED headlamps were stacked one on top of the other. While the rest of the bodywork remained the same as its predecessor, including the taillights, GMC introduced four new colors. Inside, GMC enhanced the infotainment system and included the wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as a standard feature for the entire range. For the Denali trim level, GMC had an 8"" infotainment as part of the package. Another useful feature was the head-up display, which became available as an option for the SLT and AT4 versions and standard on the Denali. Under the hood, GMC kept most of its previous engines and added an inline-four turbocharged gasoline engine paired to a nine-speed automatic transmission. Its state-of-the-art direct-injected system and variable valve timing made it very fuel-efficient.",GMC,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Terrain"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""restyled"", ""compact"", ""taller headlights"", ""C-shaped daytime running lights"", ""four new colors""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""different front fascia""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""taller"", ""C-shaped"", ""twin LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
GMC Yukon XL,"GMC introduced the fifth generation of the Yukon XL in December 2019, and it was based on the same platform as the Chevrolet Tahoe and Cadillac Escalade ESV. While Escalade got the attention from superstars and the authorities preferred the Tahoe, the Yukon aimed to the regular Joe and Jane with a down-to-earth design. It was just a typical SUV for everyday people. Maybe not that regular, mostly if they were a big family. The fifth-generation was completely redesigned, and it was available in two length versions: the Yukon and the Yukon XL. The latter was easy to spot due to its longer rear doors and its last row of windows. These were necessary due to the longer wheelbase. At the front, though, both vehicles wore the same C-shaped signature LED headlights and the broad grille with horizontal slats, where the GMC badge found its place. For the Denali trim level, the grille looked more like a chromed fence. Inside, the XL version featured a sliding center console and room for up to nine people, depending on the seat options. In standard trim level, it offered space for seven in a 2+2+3 configuration. But according to the official statements, 60% of the Yukon customers chose the Denali version that featured all the bells and whistles GMC could provide. That included a 15” Head-up Display and a premium sound system that could compete with the equipment from your local country club. GMC introduced full independent suspension for the Yukon with air-spring on all corners. That not only improved the comfort level, but it also added a touch of inspiration since the car could have been lowered for easier access. Under the hood, GMC dropped a choice of two engines: a 5.3-liter V8 and a 6.2-liter V8.",GMC,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Yukon XL"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""large SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""down-to-earth"", ""typical"", ""longer wheelbase"", ""C-shaped signature LED headlights"", ""broad grille""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""horizontal slats"", ""C-shaped"", ""chromed (Denali trim)""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""C-shaped"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""longer rear doors""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
GMC Yukon,"GMC didn't consider to build an SUV that couldn't cope with some off-road abilities, and the AT4 version was the most capable from the Yukon range. While most of the Yukon buyers chose the Denali trim level, the carmaker considered that it might offer something even better for those with a sense of camping trips. The AT4 version was radically changed when compared to the regular version of the full-size SUV. The Yukon AT4 featured the same LED headlights as its siblings, but instead of the chromed grille, it sported a massive black big enough to serve as a gate. The engineers raised the lower part of the bumper and installed a genuine shield under the engine compartment. Thus, they helped the big SUV achieve a 32 degrees angle of approach. A set of two, effortless to spot, red tow hooks reminded the owner that the big rig might get stuck. Inside, the AT4 was available with seating for seven, even though the SUV was based on the Yukon's regular wheelbase. The dashboard featured multiple buttons for the driver and its side passenger. An important novelty for the car was the push-button transmission selector, with two holes for the R and D positions. A wide touch-screen took the most of the center stack, while the HVAC controls found their spot angled at the bottom of it. GMC offered the AT4 version with the same choice of engines from the rest of the range: a 5.3-liter for the base model and a 6.2-liter for the full-options. A 3.0-liter turbodiesel supplied by Cummins might be considered as well.",GMC,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Yukon"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""full-size SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""off-road capable"", ""rugged"", ""spacious"", ""functional"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""massive black"", ""functional""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""raised"", ""genuine shield"", ""red tow hooks""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
GMC Acadia,"GMC introduced the second generation of the Acadia in 2016 at the North American International Auto Show, but just three years later, it unveiled a facelifted version for the 2020 model-year. Based on the same platform as the Cadillac XT6 and the Chevrolet Blazer, the Acadia was a mix between these vehicles in terms of quality and refinement. Moreover, its upscale amenities were concealed behind a mundane look and a badge often seen on utility vehicles. But it was more than that. The front fascia had been heavily revised, and for the 2020 model-year it sported new headlights adorned with C-shaped daytime running lights. A broad grille with chromed double slats, or just two slats, depending on the options, let the customers know that it was not just another ordinary SUV. The Denali version even featured a lower chromed trim on the bumper and apron. From its side, there were minimal changes to the vehicle. Inside, it was a different story. GMC installed a new infotainment system that was Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatible. In addition, the automaker offered a head-up display for it, helping the drivers to keep their eyes on the road. The car was available in four trim levels starting with the SLE at the bottom and ending up with the luxurious Denali. Customers could order the vehicle in a five or seven-seat configuration. GMC added another engine under the 2020 Acadia's hood, namely a 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline unit. All versions were mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission that replaced the older six-speed gearbox used on the non-facelifted version.",GMC,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Acadia"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""upscale"", ""refined"", ""mundane look"", ""sporty"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""chromed"", ""double slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""C-shaped"", ""adorned"", ""new""],    ""bumper"": [""chromed"", ""lower trim""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
GMC Savana,"The Savana 1500 was the classic utility van that proved to be successful as an MPV as well. With room for up to 8 passengers, it was also used as a fleet vehicle, shuttle, or limousine vehicles. The car's origin dated back in 1976 and the basic vehicle remained the same. It was built on a ladder-chassis, with a solid axle in the back and independent front suspension. It was available with 2- or 4-wheel-drive. The 2013 Savana 1500 was available with a slightly redesigned front fascia. The big headlights were positioned high so they were protected in the event of a minor parking crashes. A big, sliding, door was available on the right side, to ease the access inside the vehicle. Twin-doors on hinges were placed in the rear. Inside, the Savana 1500 offered room for 8 passengers as standard, with two trim levels: LS and LT.  For the front passengers, the former three passengers bench-seat was deleted and only the two individual seats were offered. The classic dashboard was big, high, and flat as in most of the utility vans. But when compared to that, the passenger version had new amenities on it. From the multiple-zone climate control system to the new audio system which includes CD/MP3, a USB port, and SiriusXM satellite radio. Two Vortec engines were available for the Savana 1500 lineup: a 195-hp 4.3-liter V6 available on the rear-wheel-drive cargo van only and a 310-hp E85 FlexFuel 5.3-liter V8 fitted as standard for the passenger version.

GMC Canyon Crew Cab,"When the GM and Isuzu joined their forces to built reliable workhorses on four wheels, they also agreed who will sell where. And the GM had the U.S. This is how the GMC Canyon ended up having the same chassis as an Isuzu D-Max. The GMC Canyon was the kind of truck that could be used as a daily driver and a weekend companion. It was developed as a premium midsize truck, with an impressive front fascia that evoked power and supremacy on the road. The Denali trim level even had a massive chrome grille and unique 20” wheels. The flared arches added some muscular lines to the vehicle. The Crew Cab was the four-door version and a true 5-seater. Inside, the dashboard was closer to an SUV than to a utility truck. And the vehicle was good to serve well for both purposes. In the center console, a standard 8” touchscreen infotainment system was installed and was able to connect via Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. It featured OnStar 4G LTE connectivity and WiFi hot-spot. Under the hood, the Canyon had two engine choices, depending on the market. The standard model featured a 3.6-liter V6 unit installed and a 2.8-liter Duramax turbo-diesel was offered as an option. Both were mated as standard with a 6-speed automatic. It was offered in a 2WD or 4WD configuration and it was able to tow up to 7,000 lbs (3,175 kg).",GMC,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""GMC Canyon"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""midsize truck"",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""muscular"", ""powerful"", ""supreme"", ""impressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""chrome""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""unique"", ""20-inch""],    ""doors"": [""four-door""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
GMC Sierra 2500HD,"The 2020 GMC Sierra Heavy Duty has been redesigned from the ground up to combine even greater capability for towing trailers with style, and has been packed with the latest technology available on heavy-duty pickup trucks in general. An even bolder exterior design is emphasized by the new signature lighting, which includes prominent so-called “light blades,” consisting of LED daylight driving lights. LED technology is used almost everywhere on the car, including for the new headlamps, taillights, optionally available fog lamps and other elements, such as the available roof marker lights. The interior has been redesigned as well, now offering best-in-segment head- and leg room for the Crew Cab version. The driver benefits from an even higher driving position, while the optionally available head-up display is a first for its segment. Towing fans will rejoice at the news that the model can now be had with a segment-first Allison 10-speed automatic transmission paired with the tried-and-true 6.6L Duramax turbo diesel. With 445 horsepower and a massive 910 lb-ft of torque at its disposal, the legendary Duramax engine now has increased cooling capacity mostly thanks to the introduction of a dual-path intake system that uses the prominent hood scoop to cool air.

GMC Hummer EV,"The world almost forgot the Hummer brand in 2020 when GM resurrected it with the introduction of the EV, an electric pickup that flexed its muscles over rough terrain. Hummer evolved from a military vehicle to a civilian SUV, and in 1992 it started to sell civilian vehicles based on the army model. It was the Hummer H1 followed later on by the H2 and the H3 models. During the world economic crisis, Hummer went bankrupt and was just a step away from being purchased by a Chinese company. But the Chinese government said no, so the brand stayed in the GMC portfolio, but without any product. The vehicle's look resembled the H2 model, with a wide and square design for the front end. The greenhouse looked like a box on top of another box, with an open bed in the back. While it wasn't the first vehicle of this type built by Hummer, the EV showed a modern styling, even if it was a retro-design. But it was made well. Inside, the square design was continued, but with modern touches. In front of the driver, the designers installed a 12.3"" digital instrument display. On top of the center stack, there was a bigger, 13.4"" infotainment display. The top cover was removable and could have been stored in the ""frunk,"" where the previous Hummers used to install the engines. The drivetrain was impressive. With three electric motors and all-wheel-steering ability, the Hummer EV was built for real, tough, off-road. Its 35"" off-road tires were a prove for that. The drivetrain produced a total of 1000 hp and a huge 11500 lb-ft (15591 Nm) of torque, the equivalent of ten Bugatti Chiron!",GMC,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Hummer EV"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""muscular"", ""modern"", ""square"", ""impressive"", ""rugged""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""wide"", ""tall""],    ""grille"": [""wide"", ""square""],    ""hood"": [""muscular""],    ""headlights"": [""modern""],    ""bumper"": [""rugged""],    ""wheel"": [""35-inch off-road""],    ""doors"": [""boxy""],    ""roof"": [""removable"", ""storage""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
GORDON MURRAY Automotive T.33,"The second project made by Gordon Murray Automotive was unveiled in 2022, and it was a less extreme supercar than its T.50 sibling but still a serious contender in that segment. Inspired by the sports cars of the '60s, the T.33 was a more conventional approach to the supercar segment with the driver's seat moved onto the side of the cabin and a look that resembled many other famous vehicles. Moreover, just like the McLaren F1, also designed by Gordon Murray, and the T.50, the T.33 sported the air intake on the roof and the long rear end where the massive V12 engine was housed. Last but not least, the T.33 was less expensive than its extreme brother. Built on the same platform as the car manufacturer's first project, the T.50, the T.33 featured a longer hood at the front since the cabin was moved towards the center of the vehicle. That helped the carmaker create a lower roofline, but still arched and sloped down to the back. At the front, the LED headlights resembled those from the Porsche 904 and other racing cars from the era when Gordon Murray began penning Formula 1 vehicles for Brabham. At the back, there was no suction fan to cancel the ground effect but a regular grille that covered almost the entire rear fascia. In addition, a set of LED taillights with a circle design adorned it. Inside, there was room for two occupants. The instrument cluster included a large tachometer dead-center in front of the driver and flanked by two displays. On the low-mounted center console, the automaker installed the gear stick and several other buttons and knobs. Behind the cabin, Gordon Murray placed a detuned version of the 3.9-liter V12 developed by Cosworth Engineering. In addition, its maximum power was delivered at lower RPMs than on its sibling.",GORDON MURRAY Automotive,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""T.33"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""longer hood, lower roofline"",  ""overall-design"": [""conventional"", ""inspired by '60s sports cars"", ""less expensive"", ""arched and sloped roofline""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""regular"", ""covering almost entire rear fascia""],    ""hood"": [""longer""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""resembling Porsche 904""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""arched"", ""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""long rear end""]  }}```"
GORDON MURRAY Automotive T.50,"Gordon Murray designed the famous McLaren F1, and this new creation, the T.50, is the spiritual successor to that beloved supercar of the '90s. After establishing its automotive company back in 2017, the brilliant engineer announced that he would create a special supercar. In 2020, he showed a glimpse of the project, but it was not the final product. In 2023, Gordon Murray Automotive unveiled the final product, hand-built in the factory from Dunsfold, Surrey, England, where the brand is based. It was easy to realize the connection between the 1992 McLaren F1 and the 2023 Gordon Murray T.50. They both shared the same shape, with a cab-forward design and the engine compartment mounted behind the cabin. Moreover, the front fascia featured swept-back headlights, similar in shape to those from its spiritual predecessor. But, unlike that, the T.50 featured glass panels on the roof and a fin on the rear area, above a fan. Gordon Murray was famous for creating the Formula 1 Brabham BT46 race car with a suction fan in the back that helped reduce the ground effect. While it was immediately banned in races, the production version of the T.50 could have it. The cabin was fit for three persons, with the driver seated in the middle and the two passengers halfway behind them. It was the same layout as on, you guessed it, McLaren F1. Fronting the driver was a dashboard fitted with two large displays and an analog tachometer placed between them. The side console housed the gear selector and a few buttons and dials for various adjustments. Powering the whole beast was not a BMW engine anymore, like in the F1, but a Cosworth-engineered V12 that produced 663 PS (650 hp) at a stratospheric 12,100 rpm. Only 100 units were planned for production.",GORDON MURRAY Automotive,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""T.50"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""cab-forward design"", ""swept-back headlights"", ""glass panels on the roof"", ""rear fin"", ""suction fan""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""swept-back""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""compact""],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""three-person layout""],    ""roof"": [""glass panels""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""rear fin""],    ""exhaust"": [""V12 engine""]  }}```"
HINDUSTAN Pushpak/Trekker,"Underneath the panels of this vehicle were a 1956 Morris Oxford platform and a ladder-chassis. Anything else came from your local hardware store. There was a time when problems needed simple, quick solutions. India was in desperate need of vehicles that could cope with damaged or non-existent roads. The Hindustan carmaker decided to offer a quick fix for that. It took a platform, reinforced the chassis, and made a rear-wheel-drive vehicle powered by a simple, naturally aspirated, Isuzu diesel engine that provided great fuel efficiency. If someone asked a five-year-old child to draw an off-road car, he would make a Hindustan Trekker. The vehicle featured completely flat everything: side panels, hood, and fenders. The front fenders were shorter than the engine's height, so the hood was like a lid with a rim around it. Strangely, the design team considered making a slightly raked windshield. It is incredible how much they could do in their launch break! Inside, the carmaker offered the vehicle a few options for seating positions. It was with two seats at the front, and a bench in the rear, or two chairs in the front and two benches mounted longitudinally behind them. The later version was good to transport as many people as it could fit inside. There was a dash panel too, which looked like a plank with the dials fitted inside. Under the hood of the 5-years old child dream car, Hindustan installed a choice of two diesel engines built by Isuzu. Despite the ""off-road"" look, the Trekker was rear-wheel-drive only, and it also bared the name Pushpak. A sweet irony was the fact that the passengers had to step down and push the car when going uphill.",HINDUSTAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Hindustan Trekker"",  ""year"": ""1956"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""off-road"", ""utilitarian"", ""simple"", ""flat"", ""rugged""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""flat"", ""slightly raked""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""flat""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""two-seater"", ""bench seating""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""rear-mounted""]  }}```"
HINDUSTAN RTV/Ranger,"The Indian market needed special vehicles for special purposes, and the Hindustan RTV was one of them, needed for police forces but also used as a spacious family carrier. When talking about an MPV, there are different meanings for that term. Every area has its needs, and some comfort features would have been useless in some countries. The Hindustan RTV was a different kind of MPV, built for special conditions. With its flat windows and body panels, the RTV was cheap to built and repair in the event of a small crash. Since the vehicle was built on a ladder chassis, access inside was more or less difficult. The interesting idea was to add a small window at the front lower sides so the driver could see better where to steer. It was a good decision for a car built to go over rough terrain. Inside, there was a simple, bus-like dash panel for the driver. The RTV was a good choice for those who needed a car to transform it into an earth-roamer. Depending on the configuration, the RTV could have been fitted with seats and benches for up to eight passengers or fewer seats and room for standing occupants. The RTV was offered with a diesel or a hybrid (gasoline-LPG) engine. It was mated to a standard 4-speed gearbox and a low-range selector. That system allowed the car to run at a constant, five kph (3 mph) speed on bad roads or cruise with 90 kph on paved roads.",HINDUSTAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Hindustan RTV"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""spacious family carrier"",  ""overall-design"": [""spacious"", ""rugged"", ""simple"", ""versatile"", ""durable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""flat"", ""functional""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""flat""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""functional""],    ""wheel"": [""rugged""],    ""doors"": [""simple"", ""functional""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HOLDEN Commodore Sedan,"Holden Commodore is a medium to large sedan and was first produced in 1978.

With the new software, Drive mode control continuously analyses the information through the sensors, optimizing the systems for the best traction and road position. Inside, we find a cockpit defined by clean lines and modern surfaces with soft-feel materials, which creates a style of elegance and beauty. The Holden Commodore comes with a frameless touchscreen of the infotainment system. Although many functions are controlled through the touchscreen, the driver can make quick operations through the three clusters of buttons. As for the exterior, the lower grille, the side window graphics with an upper chrome strip and the coupe-like roofline, make the car look slicker and more aerodynamic with a drag coefficient of 0.26. The center high-mounted LED stop lamp is now integrated into the roofline.

HOLDEN Caprice/Statesman,"Holden refreshed the Caprice/Statesman lineup for the 2010 model year and gave the car a punchier engine while also changing bits and pieces to enhance the car's look. The Australian arm of GM was still a frontrunner in its country, but the brand's days were numbered. Since its sales were limited to a relatively small area, it couldn't evolve. That led to slow sales, despite the carmaker's efforts to make it profitable. Despite sharing the same old platform carried over from a European sedan from the mid-80s, the Caprice/Statesman was still a comfortable vehicle, especially on long journeys. On the 2010 Caprice/Statesman was easy to notice the chromed trim around the grille, flanked by a new set of headlights. These also discretely accommodated the washers hidden under black caps within the headlamps trims. On the sides, the long blinkers from the front fenders were unique on the market. Also, the profile revealed a svelte silhouette, with soft lines and long rear doors that eased the ingress and egress to the back seats. The luxurious interior boasted Nappa-wrapped seats and leather trims everywhere on the steering wheel, gear selector, and handbrake. Thanks to the wood trims spread around the dashboard, door cards, and center stack, the car created a luxurious ambiance fit for top governmental officials. Part of the standard features was also the infotainment unit with ten speakers. In the back, the bench was wide enough to fit three people inside, although the transmission tunnel was quite high. Yet, it was no problem for just two occupants. Under the hood, Holden installed the latest evolution of the 3.6-liter V6 engine paired to a six-speed automatic transmission. For those in a hurry, the carmaker added an option for a 6.0-liter V8.",HOLDEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Caprice/Statesman"",  ""year"": ""2010"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""svelte"", ""comfortable"", ""elegant"", ""punchy""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""chromed"", ""flanked"", ""unique""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""new"", ""discrete""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""long"", ""rear""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HOLDEN Rodeo,"Holden was one of the brands that benefited from Isuzu and General Motors' agreement, receiving the Rodeo lineup, which it introduced on the market in 2003. Based on the Chevrolet's Colorado chassis, the Holden Rodeo was a re-badged Isuzu D-Max sold in Australia and New Zeeland in a few body shapes. It was the workhorse in the Space-Cab version and a family-friendly vehicle in the Double-Cab version. Even if the car looked like the design team was the less-favored part in the project, it showed a rugged style, fit for the light pickup market. Its vertical headlights made room for a wider grille, needed mainly for the gasoline-powered versions. On the sides, the car sported an additional set of windows behind the doors, with a pop-out opening system. Holden offered the Space Cab either as a chassis-cab or as a complete vehicle with a bed that provided a maximum length of 2270 mm (83.3"") Inside, the materials used were not of the highest quality, but they were built to last. Its hard-plastic dashboard and soft padding on the door panels offered an adequate compromise for the vehicle's destination. The instrument cluster was carried over from Isuzu, with a large speedometer in the middle, flanked by a tachometer on the left and the fuel and temperature gauges on the right. On top of the center stack, the carmaker installed three buttons for the 4x4 traction system. Unlike Isuzu, who offered the car mostly with diesel engines, and Chevrolet, who sold the Colorado with gasoline versions, Holden benefited from both versions. Power ranged between a 78 hp diesel unit and a 200 hp V-6 gasoline powerplant.",HOLDEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Holden Rodeo"",  ""year"": ""2003"",  ""size"": ""Light pickup"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""family-friendly"", ""workhorse""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wider""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""vertical""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""additional set of windows""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HOLDEN Combo,"Australians needed a light utility vehicle to use it inside cities, and the Vauxhall/Opel Combo platform proved to be the right answer. The first Combo based on the European platform from the Corsa lineup was too small for almost everything. Facing stiff competition in Europe from Volkswagen Caddy, Renault Kangoo, or Fiat Doblo, GM had to adapt the lineup. The Combo name was already known, so all it had to do was to increase the volume while keeping the price in a decent range. It did it, and, more than that, it exported the project in Down Under to be built under the Holden badge. Vauxhall/Opel Corsa was a very well known product in Europe, and GM considered that it might be a good idea to keep the same front fascia from the small-segment vehicle. Thus, it confirmed the city-destination of the vehicle. But any visual connection with that model ended right behind the hood. A taller cabin led was needed to make a bigger cargo compartment. The designers extended the wheelbase and added sliding doors to the car. In the back, the Combo was offered with asymmetrical doors. If judged by the front seats, the Combo was not a commercial vehicle. It featured a nice dashboard, with a CD on the center stack and even a navigation system. Unlike the shorter Corsa, the Combo offered plenty of headroom and, moreover, a storage area above the driver, good for the lunch box, some luggage, or a shotgun. Whatever works. For the engine compartment, Holden chose only one engine option, a gasoline 1.4-liter unit. It was fuel-efficient in the city. The only available gearbox was a 5-speed manual.",HOLDEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Holden Combo"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""small utility vehicle"",  ""overall-design"": [""city-destination"", ""taller cabin"", ""extended wheelbase"", ""sliding doors"", ""asymmetrical doors""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""front fascia from small-segment vehicle""],    ""hood"": [""extended""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""extended wheelbase""],    ""doors"": [""sliding"", ""asymmetrical""],    ""roof"": [""taller cabin""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HOLDEN Malibu,"GM Australia introduced the Holden Malibu on its home market in 2013, based on the same platform as the British Vauxhall Insignia and the American Chevrolet Malibu. While the Malibu name was well-known in the U.S., it wasn't that common on the streets of Adelaide or Sydney. It didn't have past history to compare, and that was, somehow, an advantage. Nobody cried because it was no longer rear-wheel-drive since it was just brand new for that market. The 2013 model was built on top of the Epsilon II platform, but it was greatly improved when compared with other European or American siblings. Its design evolved into a much-rounded bodywork with a Holden-specific grille that sported a chromed slat on the upper side. Its swept-back headlights and sculptured side panels led to an image of a bigger car. The bumper featured a lower grille flanked by two clusters for the fog lights. In the rear, it featured Chevrolet Camaro-inspired LED dual-element taillamps. The Malibu interior featured an all-new dual cockpit design that created an inviting, roomy and comfortable environment. The increased width of the vehicle led to a more spacious cabin. The Malibu featured metallic, chrome, or wood accents located around the shifter, surrounding the center stack, around the instrument cluster, and on doors and the steering wheel. Under the hood, Holden installed a choice of two engines: 2.4-liter gasoline and a 2.0-liter turbo-diesel, the same used for Vauxhall/Opel Insignia, in Europe.",HOLDEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Holden Malibu"",  ""year"": ""2013"",  ""size"": ""spacious"",  ""overall-design"": [""rounded bodywork"", ""Holden-specific grille"", ""swept-back headlights"", ""sculptured side panels"", ""Chevrolet Camaro-inspired taillamps""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""chromed slat""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [""lower grille"", ""fog light clusters""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""metallic, chrome, or wood accents""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HOLDEN Barina RS,"By 2014, it was pretty uncommon to find the words “Barina” and “Sporty” in the same sentence. The regular Holden Barina was nothing more but a good spec bargain city car. However, Holden raised the bar with the new Barina RS, a sporty enough car to worth the RS badge. The car promised to offer good value for the money, besides the specific exterior design and better performances. Aesthetically, the Barina RS was fitted with 17-inch alloys, a lower ride height, deeper bumpers, a pair of elliptical fog lights, and a trapezoidal single exhaust. The retina-searing Orange Rock exterior paint color was offered only with the RS. Aside from the mentioned difference, the Barina RS was pretty much like the CDX Barinas. Inside, the RS model featured red stitching and RS logos embroidered on the seats. The seats were wrapped up in man-made leather that looked extremely well. Even cheaper than the rival Suzuki Swift Sport, the Barina RS came with standard heated sport seats, air-conditioning, cruise control, rear parking sensors, a sport steering wheel, drilled-look pedals, and even four-wheel disc brakes. Safety-wise, the Barina RS was equipped with traction and stability control, ABS, and brake force distribution. Modern enough for 2014, the small sporty car was fitted with Holden’s MyLink infotainment system that came with a 7-inch screen and Bluetooth connectivity. Under the hood, Barina RS featured a 1.4-liter turbo unit that developed 140 hp and 200 Nm (147 lb-ft). The unit was paired with a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic gearbox that sent power to the front wheels.",HOLDEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Barina RS"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""modern"", ""aggressive"", ""stylish"", ""compact""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""deeper"", ""sleek""],    ""headlights"": [""elliptical"", ""fog""],    ""bumper"": [""deeper""],    ""wheel"": [""17-inch"", ""alloys""],    ""doors"": [""sporty""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""trapezoidal"", ""single""]  }}```"
HOLDEN Cruze Mk II,"Developed by GM as a world car, the Cruze was tested on the market in Australia, where it was unveiled in 2008. Afterward, it was also launched in Europe and the U.S., wearing the Chevrolet badge. After GM took over the remains of Daewoo Motor Corporation, it also inherited plans and sketches for future vehicles. One of them was for the platform that was later on named GM Delta II. That formed the base of the Cruze, which became a world car sold worldwide from South America to Northern Europe and Korea to the U.S. Moreover, since the development costs for this vehicle were small, the final price was attractive. At the front, the Cruze's front fascia was adorned with a chromed grille that sported a V-shaped slat where the brand's badge took center stage. The design language was dominated by arched lines and clear-cut angles. An arched roofline extended from the racked windshield to the C-pillars, with an ascending beltline. Out back, the car ended into a relatively short rear deck. Inside, GM's designers took the lead and created a modern expression of a traditional Chevy styling, with the ""twin cockpit"" layout theme carried over from the Corvette. At the front, the two bucket seats offered a mild side bolstering. They were designed mostly for long, comfortable journeys. The center stack featured the infotainment and air conditioning displays and controls. It was extended toward the center console in a curved panel, creating a unitary concept. At the back, there was room enough for three passengers, yet the legroom was not that great. Under the hood, Holden installed a choice of two engines: a 1.8-liter gasoline and a 2.0-liter turbo-diesel. Power went to the front wheels via either a five-speed manual or a six-speed automatic with manual function (named Active Select).",HOLDEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Cruze"",  ""year"": ""2008"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""world car"", ""modern"", ""attractive"", ""dominated by arched lines"", ""clear-cut angles""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""racked""],    ""grille"": [""chromed"", ""V-shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""modern"", ""twin cockpit layout""],    ""roof"": [""arched"", ""extended"", ""ascending beltline""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HONDA Passport,"Honda introduced the fourth generation of the Passport in 2023 for the 2024 model year, thus expanding its crossover and SUV lineup. The Japanese automaker worked together with GM and Isuzu to develop a road-oriented off-road vehicle, which resulted in a wide range of vehicles such as the Opel/Vauxhall Frontera in Europe, the Isuzu Amigo/Rodeo/Axiom in the U.S., and the Honda Passport. That badge-engineered product survived until 2002 when Honda pulled back from that project. Still, it kept the nameplate in its basket. In 2019, the Japanese automaker revived it, and in 2023, three decades after the model’s introduction, it launched the fourth generation of the Passport. In 2023, Honda introduced the fourth generation of the Passport for those families who enjoyed going into the woods for camping. The SUV was better prepared than its larger sibling, the Pilot, and it showed a more off-road-oriented look. The flat front fascia with a massive grille flanked by LED headlights, but despite that, the Passport still kept some of the design language already present on the Civic and the Accord. The profile showed additional plastic cladding around the wheel arches and on the side sills, which emphasized the 8.1-inch (20.5 cm) ground clearance. The short front and rear overhangs confirmed the off-road-oriented nature of the vehicle, while the 110-inch (279 cm) wheelbase ensured customers that the car could cope well with daily traffic situations. At the back, the Passport featured a raked-forward tailgate adorned at the top by a roof spoiler, while underneath the bumper, it sported a black, unpainted plastic area, an underbody plastic shield, and two exhaust pipes on the sides. Inside, the Passport offered room for up to five passengers. Honda didn’t need another people carrier in its lineup, so it made this SUV with two bucket seats at the front and a split-folding bench in the back. On the dashboard, the automaker ditched any analog dials and placed a digital cluster in front of the driver and a touchscreen for the infotainment system atop the center stack. The center console housed the buttons for the transmission, a charging pad for a mobile phone, and two cup holders. In addition, under the center armrest, the Passport featured a large cubby storage. In the back, the flat floor allowed three passengers to sit comfortably, although the back side of the center console intruded into the middle-seated passenger area. But, at least there was no center tunnel to hump on. Underneath its skin, Honda installed a platform with independent suspension in all corners and an intelligent all-wheel-drive system based on torque vectoring, which made the vehicle very capable in off-road situations compared to other crossovers on the market. Under the hood was the same 3.5-liter naturally-aspirated V6 that powered the Pilot and the ten-speed automatic transmission.",HONDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Passport"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""mid-size SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""off-road-oriented"", ""rugged"", ""modern"", ""functional"", ""spacious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""flat""],    ""grille"": [""massive""],    ""hood"": [""short""],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""raked-forward"", ""black""],    ""wheel"": [""plastic cladding"", ""8.1-inch ground clearance""],    ""doors"": [""two bucket seats"", ""split-folding bench""],    ""roof"": [""adorned with roof spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": [""two exhaust pipes""]  }}```"
HONDA Accord,"Honda introduced the 11th generation of the Accord for the U.S. market in 2022, and despite all odds, it made a downsize on its engine lineup, but in a good way. The Japanese vehicle was already the best-selling car in America for more than five decades, and what started as a humble three-door hatchback became a favorite family vehicle. Unlike other carmakers from the same segment, the Accord always had a sporty side, but without being a true sports sedan, and that helped it sell in high numbers. The 2023 Accord's front fascia resembled the one used for its smaller sibling, the Civic. Its grille featured a wide hexagonal shape, and the narrow LED headlights sported the daytime running lights on their upper side, like eyebrows. From its profile, the elongated silhouette revealed an arched roofline over the greenhouse. Honda kept the third side windows behind the rear doors, but the back of the cabin wasn't that sloped anymore and moved onto a more conventional, three-box-shape design. Finally, at the back, the 2022 Accord had corner-mounted taillights that were extended over the trunk's lid. Inside, the Japanese automaker followed the same idea seen in the same era Civic, with a grille that ran across the entire dashboard. Atop the center stack, the Accord featured a standard 7"" infotainment display with an option for a 12.3-inch unit. Fronting the driver, the 10.2"" instrument panel was fitted as standard. Like on its predecessors, the bolstered front seats provided some side support. At the same time, in the back, the bench was capable of offering enough room for three adult-sized occupants. Apart from the base version, powered by a 1.5-liter turbocharged gasoline unit, the Accord was also available with an improved hybrid system. The electrified versions were powered by 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle engines paired with two electric motors.",HONDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Accord"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""midsize"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""elegant"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""wide"", ""angled""],    ""grille"": [""wide"", ""hexagonal""],    ""hood"": [""elongated""],    ""headlights"": [""narrow"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""conventional""],    ""wheel"": [""standard""],    ""doors"": [""four"", ""functional""],    ""roof"": [""arched""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""corner-mounted""]  }}```"
HONDA Pilot,"Honda introduced the seventh generation of its biggest SUV, the Pilot, in November 2022 for the 2023 model year, and it was also the most potent high-rider in the carmaker's history. The 2023 model year promised a better experience for its customers, offering a larger vehicle with a roomier interior and better off-road abilities. Moreover, the Pilot's fourth generation didn't look like an oversized CR-V model anymore. In addition, it didn't follow the supercharging trend, placing its bets on customers who enjoyed the beauty of a naturally aspirated engine. With a rugged look, the 2023 Pilot featured a flat, vertical front fascia that was mostly covered by a broad grille. Its LED headlights resembled those installed on the Civic, yet its design was dominated by sharp lines. From its profile, Honda's largest crossover featured a raked-forward C-pillar and an unusually designed third side window that featured an ascending lower line towards the tilted D-pillar. In addition, at the back, the Pilot got standard LED taillights. Finally, the Trailsport version was fitted with steel underbody shields, plus front and rear recovery points. At the time of launch, the Pilot boasted the roomiest cabin in its class. Moreover, it offered something for every taste. Thus, the base version came fitted with a standard digital instrument panel with an option for a 10.2"" TFT. Atop the center stack, the car received a 7"" touchscreen with an option for a 9"" unit for the infotainment system. Under the hood, the carmaker installed its famous 3.5-liter V6 engine with a direct injection system. It was paired as standard with a 10-speed automatic gearbox that sent the power in all corners.",HONDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Pilot"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""larger, roomier"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""sharp lines"", ""dominated by sharp lines"", ""raked-forward C-pillar"", ""unusually designed third side window""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""vertical""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""resembling those installed on the Civic""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""rugged""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HONDA CR-V,"Honda unveiled the sixth generation of the European CR-V version in the spring of 2023 and it was different than its American sibling. The Japanese automaker was one of the few to create specific versions of the same car on both sides of the Pond. Thus, even though at first sight it looked identical to the one sold on the North American continent, it was different in many aspects, especially on the exterior and on its mechanical underpinnings. With the sixth generation of the CR-V, Honda completed the cycle of a unitary design language. The SUV's headlights were slim and angled upwards on their outer sides, resembling those installed on the Civic. The main grille sported a 3D hexagonal pattern that tried to conceal the diminished cooling area the car needed. On the lower side of the bumper, the European version featured a broad trapezoidal air intake flanked by air intakes meant to divert the airflow on the car's sides. While the profile showed a similar look, with an ascending line at the bottom of the third row of windows, the taillights were specific for the EU market, with red LEDs and red lenses. The American version, on the other hand, featured clear lenses. Inside, the main difference could be noticed in the center console. The EU version boasted buttons for the gear selector, while the U.S. model received an actual shifter. Maybe it was more comfortable for Honda's customers or just a matter of taste. Still, both versions were fitted with a standard infotainment unit placed atop the center stack. But the most crucial difference was for the drivetrains. The U.S. model was powered by a 1.5-liter turbocharged engine. On the other hand, the European version boasted a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter running in the Atkinson cycle. There were two versions available: a mild-hybrid and a plug-in hybrid.",HONDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""CR-V"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""slim headlights"", ""3D hexagonal grille"", ""trapezoidal air intake"", ""ascending profile line"", ""specific taillights""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""3D hexagonal pattern""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""slim"", ""angled upwards""],    ""bumper"": [""broad trapezoidal air intake""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HONDA HR-V 5 Doors,"The second generation of the North-American version of the HR-V was introduced in 2022 as a 2023 model year and surprised its audience with its new approach and increased size. Honda introduced the HR-V in some markets. The crossover was a novelty for those times since it was based on the same platform as Honda Logo, a small-sized vehicle. The second generation, introduced in 2013 at the North American International Auto Show, was based on the Jazz/Fit's platform. But then, in 2022, the Japanese automaker changed its ideas and built the second generation of the North American version of the HR-V on the Civic's platform. The same model was sold on the Chinese market and in several other countries and was also known as Honda ZR-V. At the front, the angular headlights flanked a narrow, octagonal grille in the bumper. On the lower apron, a second air intake added more cooling surface for the engine. In addition, a pair of side scoops channeled the air around the vehicle to aid aerodynamics. From its profile, the sculptured door panels and the raised beltline created a dynamic image for the car. Moreover, the raked-forward C-pillars at the back emphasized the vehicle's sporty character. Inside, the HR-V boasted a 7"" digital instrument panel, while a 7"" touchscreen was placed atop the center stack. A metallic honeycomb mesh stretched from door to door across the dashboard. At the front, the automaker installed a pair of bucket seats, while at the back, the occupants could sit on a 60/40 split-folding bench.

HONDA Civic 5 Doors,"Honda unveiled the European-inspired Civic hatchback for the North-American market, and it offered more than just a new shape compared with its sedan sibling. The Japanese carmaker had that unusual policy to offer different body versions for specific markets. For many years, it delivered a Civic Coupe in America but not in Europe and a hatchback on the Old Continent but not in the New World. Starting with the 2022 model, the carmaker changed its mind, canceled the coupe, and introduced the hatchback as a second option for the sedan version. While the two siblings shared most of their components, they had some different design details. For instance, the hatchback featured a concave front grille with a honeycomb pattern. The lower bumper design showed a broad, A-shaped grille, similar to the one installed on the sedan version. While both cars sported the same design, the hatchback had round fog lights instead of squared ones. From its profile, the five-door version featured black side sills, which made the car looks slimmer, but the most noticeable difference was in the back. Honda designed treated the vehicle with European ingredients, and its designers took their inspiration from there. Thus, the raked-forward C-pillars and the tailgate formed a sloped, Kammback-style ending. The rear bumper was completely different, and it sported two chromed, fake exhausts and a diffuser. The interior featured an unusual honeycomb pattern on the dashboard. Honda never did that before, and it was a bold move from the Japanese carmaker. It installed a standard 7” touch-screen on top of the center stack with physical turning knobs for volume and tuning/selection. As an option, it provided a 9” display for the Sport Touring trim level. Inside the instrument cluster, the Civic hatchback offered a seven-inch color display and an analog speedometer, or a completely digital 10.2” TFT for the full-spec version. The carmaker installed a 60/40 split-folding bench at the back, which provided a larger trunk than the sedan. Honda installed the same powerplants as in the sedan version: a 1.5-liter turbocharged and a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter. The carmaker paired both engines with a CVT transmission but added an option for a six-speed manual.",HONDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Civic"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""European-inspired"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""sporty"", ""bold""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""concave"", ""honeycomb pattern""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""round fog lights""],    ""bumper"": [""broad"", ""A-shaped grille"", ""lower bumper design""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""raked-forward C-pillars"", ""sloped"", ""Kammback-style ending""],    ""diffusor"": [""chromed"", ""fake exhausts"", ""European-inspired""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""chromed"", ""fake""]  }}```"
HONDA Civic Sedan,"The Civic was one of the most notorious nameplates in Honda's inventory, and the eleventh generation of this moniker, it brought electrification to a whole new level. The 2022 Civic was not the first hybrid in the carmaker's inventory. Several other models preceded it, such as the Insight with two generations, the Civic VIII sedan, and the CR-V, to name just a few. But Honda was also very good at producing naturally aspirated engines, so it paired these two elements and created one of the best Civics ever made. While the car's exterior was tamed down when compared with its predecessor, it features all the right lines in the right places. The front fascia resembled the eleventh generation of the American Accord, with slim headlights and a narrow main grille. On the lower side of the bumper, the automaker installed a broader second grille flanked by a pair of side scoops needed for the fog lamps. From its profile, the fastback-shaped Civic left the impression of a coupe, even though it was not. Finally, at the back, the C-shaped taillights were spread from the quarter panels onto the tailgate. Inside, the automaker tried its best to provide not just a comfortable cabin but also a high-tech one. Thus, most of the safety features of the vehicle, such as the adaptive cruise control and the lane-keep assist, were fitted as standard. The front bolstered bucket seats provided enough side support for their occupants during high-speed cornering. In the rear, the bench was adequate, even for three adults. In addition, it was split-folding and could expand the trunk volume from a respectable 410 liters (14.5 cu-ft) to a staggering for its class 1,220 liters (43 cu-ft). The standard infotainment unit featured a 7"" display on the center stack. Under the hood, Honda provided the e:HEV with just one drivetrain option.

The first generation of the Odyssey was introduced in 1995 and it was a great addition to a market hungry for innovative minivans. It was different in a good way and soon it became a desirable car for the North-American MPV market. The 2020 facelift brought a new bumper design, with a slimmer lower grille. The headlights followed the same design style as the Honda Accord or the Civic. It was unusual to see an MPV with such an aggressive stance. On the sides, the sculptured door panels resembled those installed on the FCX Clarity hydrogen car. The D-pillars featured a black area that visually led to a floating-roof design. Inside, the Odyssey was fitted with room for up to eight passengers. The middle row was sliding, tilting, or have the center seat removed, leading to a wider room for the occupants and creating a passage through to the rear seats. The car was fitted with a new option, named CabinWatch, which warned the driver if someone was still on the rear seats. Under the hood, the Odyssey was fitted with the same 3.5-liter i-VTEC engine as before and it was mated to the new, 10-speed, automatic transmission available on the Honda Accord as well. Unlike the Accord, the Odyssey was not available with the new 2.0-liter turbocharged unit.",HONDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Odyssey"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""big MPV"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive stance"", ""innovative"", ""desirable"", ""sculptured panels"", ""floating-roof design""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""slimmer"", ""lower""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""aggressive"", ""similar to Accord/Civic""],    ""bumper"": [""new design"", ""slimmer""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured panels""],    ""roof"": [""floating""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HONDA Ridgeline,"Looking for mechanical updates? Well, don’t, because the 2021 Ridgeline doesn’t have any. It seems that the 2021 Ridgeline went on steroids to achieve the new makeover, probably because Honda observed that Americans are more attracted to big pick-ups, like Dodge’s. The new Ridgeline was mostly focused on style, bringing a new hood, a new dual exhaust, new fenders and a completely new face. The front bumper cover was redesigned with added functional slick air curtains, The grille was the most considerable change the Ridgeline saw, increasing in size and becoming bolder. Honda also introduced the Honda performance development appearance package (so called HPD) that came with a unique grille, black fender flares and bronze alloy wheels. Overall, the Honda’s only pick-up got a tougher truck-like design. Inside the new Ridgeline we could notice the upgraded infotainment system, with updated new graphics, quicker reactions and also a physical knob. The materials used were the same good quality as on the previous 2020 model, however, the new one came with new contrast-color stitching standard on all trim levels. The users could choose between the standard front wheel drive and the iVTM four-wheel-drive system, the 280 hp being sent to the wheels through the standard 9-speed automatic transmission. The 280 hp were developed by the standard 3.5-liter direct-injected VTEC V6 engine.",HONDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ridgeline"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""big"",  ""overall-design"": [""tougher"", ""truck-like"", ""bold"", ""functional"", ""upgraded""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""bolder"", ""larger"", ""unique""],    ""hood"": [""new""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""redesigned"", ""functional""],    ""wheel"": [""bronze alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual""]  }}```"
HONDA Civic Type-R,"Honda introduced the sixth generation of its Civic Type R in July 2022 for the 2023 model year and heated up the hot-hatch segment once again. With over 25 years of history, the Type R moniker always spelled an aura of a performance car dressed in civilian clothes. It was the car that could do a school run, a shopping day, and a day at the track without tearing a sweat. But, with the introduction of the sixth generation of this nameplate, installed on the eleventh generation of the Civic, the Japanese automaker finally combined the turbocharged engine with the independent suspension in all corners. While its predecessor looked outrageous, with manga-inspired styling, and a huge wing on the back, the 2023 Type R looked less aggressive. Its front fascia showed the specific red H badge on the black grille, while the lower bumper received real side air-intakes that improved the car's aerodynamics. In addition, the automaker installed a functional scoop on the hood meant to draw cold air into the engine bay. Finally, at the back, Honda offered a big wing fitted as an option. It wasn't standard anymore and thus not present on any Type R. Unlike its regular Civic sibling, the Type R featured sport bucket seats with cut-outs for racing harnesses into the tall seatback. In front of the driver, the carmaker installed a TFT screen, while atop the center stack, Honda placed a digital display. Unlike the regular Civic, the Type R received a gear stick on the center console. Underneath the hood, Honda installed a reworked version of the same K20C1 inline-four powerplant featured on the fifth generation. Yet, the 2023 model year provided more power than its predecessor offered. Finally, like any other Civic Type R, this version was exclusively available with a six-speed manual.",HONDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Civic Type R"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""turbocharged"", ""independent suspension"", ""functional"", ""aggressive"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black"", ""specific red H badge""],    ""hood"": [""functional scoop""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""lower with real side air-intakes""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sport bucket seats"", ""racing harness cut-outs""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""big wing fitted as an option""],    ""exhaust"": [""reworked version of the powerplant""]  }}```"
HONDA Jazz / Fit,"Honda still insists on trying to conquer the small-segment with a small MPV while everyone else builds hatchbacks. So, they introduced the new Jazz/Fit. A small MPV that has been on the market since 2000 and it is now on its fourth generation. The previous generations were available only as city-vehicles. This time, the Jazz also comes with a cross-over variant, called Jazz Crosstar, which features some plastic overfenders and SUV-inspired details, although underneath it is still a Jazz. But just remember that the crossover Honda HR-V also used the Jazz/Fit platform. If the previous generation had a hybrid version, the 2020 Jazz has only hybrid units under the hood. An 98 hp gasoline engine is helped by an electric motor and the total output goes to 109 hp. Honda didn't specify any performance data, but we will update the info on the way. Inside, the MPV shape helps in getting a big interior room. The Magic Seats system for the rear seats was maintained. Also, the foldable rear seatback is still available. This means that the gas tank is still under the driver seat, leading to a higher driving position. The dashboard is in the Internet and connectivity age, with a big TFT as an instrument panel and a 9” touch-screen for the infotainment unit. The 2020 Jazz has Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.",HONDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Jazz/Fit"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""small"", ""MPV"", ""crossover"", ""hybrid"", ""spacious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""big"", ""angled""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""compact""],    ""headlights"": [""sleek""],    ""bumper"": [""modern""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""functional""],    ""roof"": [""sloping""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HONDA Civic Coupe,"The 2019 Honda Civic Coupe was introduced along with the facelift for the entire tenth generation of the compact Civic. It featured new improvements in the equipment and accessories. The tenth generation of the Civic Coupe came back with better suspension, better safety equipment, better styling and a big trunk. But it also came with some design flaws that had to be corrected. In 2018, Honda showed that it listened to its customers and changed the Civic and the Civic Coupe. For the 2019 model year, the Civic Coupe was offered in four different trims: LX, Sport, EX and Touring. It was also offered as SI as a separate offer on the market, with its own package that was added to the special engine. The restyled lower bumper gave the Civic a wider look and it was complemented by new, blacked-out headlights. On Touring trim, the LED headlights were upgraded with a new design to give the lights a wider and longer beam. At the rear, Civic Sedan's lower bumper has received a chrome strip. Civic Coupe has received a special new color named Tonic Yellow Pearl. Inside, the 2019 model featured an upgraded sound system that featured a volume knob. The non-facelift version was highly criticized by customers and media for replacing the classic knob with a touch-slider that was harder to operate while driving. For the Sport trim level, the Coupe received a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter engine that was mated as standard with a 6-speed manual or an option for a CVT. The other trim levels featured the 1.5-liter turbocharged unit.",HONDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Honda Civic Coupe"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""facelift"", ""stylish"", ""sleek"", ""wide"", ""upgraded""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""blacked-out""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""new design"", ""blacked-out""],    ""bumper"": [""restyled"", ""lower"", ""wider"", ""chrome strip""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HONDA Insight,"While most of the hybrids available looked weird, the Honda Insight gave no apparent hint that it was a hybrid, aside for the badge at the rear. More attractive than most of the sedans, the Insight sported design cues taken from the sibling Accord. Based on a Civic platform, the sedan borrowed the roof and the rear quarter panels, while the rest was unique and specific to the Insight. Inside, the quiet cabin was fitted with a standard active noise cancellation system. Even in the entry level, the Insight sported soft to touch materials and a 5-inch display, while the upper trim levels even featured fancy seats with perforated leather. The top of the range had heated seats, and while extremely comfortable and suitable for long journeys, lumbar support adjustment was not available. The roomy cabin offered great space for all occupants and was equipped with numerous large storage spaces. To enhance convenience, and USB and a wireless charging pad were part of the package. Fitted with a 1.5-liter Atkinson-Cycle 4-cylinder engine, a lithium-ion battery pack and Honda’s two motor hybrid drive system, the Insight offered a reduced fuel consumption. The available driving modes offered the possibility to cover up miles using only electricity, besides the Normal and the Sport mode which offered a quicker acceleration response. Another great feature was the possibility of adjusting the regenerative braking intensity using the shift paddles mounted behind the steering wheel: left for more intense and right for less intense. The cargo space was generous and with the batteries placed under the rear seats, they folded like normal seats, extending the trunk’s capacity. The base trim level was very well equipped with numerous safety features part of the Honda Sensing: dynamic cruise control, lane keeping assist and forward collision warning with automatic braking. Other features included automatic high beams, traffic sign recognition, a multi-angle back-up camera, remote engine start, blind spot camera and smart entry with walk away lock.",HONDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Honda Insight"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""roomy"",  ""overall-design"": [""attractive"", ""sporty"", ""quiet"", ""comfortable"", ""convenient""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""unique""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""fancy""],    ""roof"": [""borrowed from Civic""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HONDA Legend Sedan,"While the American market demanded an executive premium car from Acura, the Japanese carmaker tried to sell it as a Honda in Japan and other Asian countries. The experiment didn't work as well as the carmaker hoped for. It proved that Asian customers didn't share the American taste in cars. While in the U.S., a car had to offer cupholders, automatic transmission, and offer a comfortable ride on the highway. In other countries, those might not be on top of the list. Honda introduced the fifth Legend generation in 2014 and only on selected markets. It showed a stylish, pentagonal grille that sported a thick horizontal chromed slat at the top and followed by two other slim slats. From its sides, the three-box executive sedan featured a cab-rearward design, with a pushed-back C-pillar above the rear axle and a short trunk. Inside, a leather-clad interior proved a high level of taste for the Japanese carmaker. The dashboard featured curved lines combined in sharp angles for the instrument cluster and the infotainment screen placed above the center stack. A wide center console with wood trims and storage compartments separated the driver from its passenger. In the back, the carmaker installed a bench for three, with three headrests and seatbelts. Under the hood, Honda offered the Legend's fifth-generation only with a hybrid system powered by a 3.5-liter V-6 powerplant and three electric motors.",HONDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Legend"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": ""executive sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""stylish"", ""cab-rearward"", ""leather-clad"", ""curved lines"", ""sharp angles""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""pentagonal"", ""thick horizontal chromed slat"", ""slim slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HONDA Civic Sedan US,"Honda introduced a facelift for the 2008 model-year Civic, which included a few enhancements to its compact sedan. The Civic was one of the best-selling Honda vehicles, and its popularity grew thanks to its reliable engines, low maintenance costs, and comfortable ride. But all these came with a higher price than many of its competitors. To attract even more customers to its showrooms, the Japanese carmaker tried a different approach with a more refined design for the 2008 model. At the front, the Civic featured a new bumper, with a wider, three-way split grille and side air-intakes. They were mostly aesthetic since the car didn’t really need an improvement for the cooling area. On the sides, the door mirrors received turn signals for all trim levels, while the wheels got a new look. At the back, a chromed bar linked the two L-shaped taillights. Inside, the most important changes were on the steering wheel and on the center stack. The former received a three-spoke design inspired by the European version, while the latter got an infotainment system with sat-nav. On the top trim level, the EX, the carmaker installed a seven-speaker sound system, while the lower versions got only four. Under the hood, Honda installed its 1.8-liter, 140 hp engine on the base level paired with a five-speed manual or, as an option, with a five-speed automatic. A CNG version was exclusively available for fleet buyers in most states, apart from California and New York. The 1.3-liter hybrid was also an excellent choice for commuters, thanks to its high fuel efficiency.",HONDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Civic"",  ""year"": ""2008"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""refined"", ""aesthetic"", ""chromed"", ""comfortable"", ""reliable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wider"", ""three-way split""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""L-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [""new""],    ""wheel"": [""new look""],    ""doors"": [""received turn signals""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HONDA NSX,"Honda didn't want to disappoint its customers when it announced that it would launch a new generation for the famous NSX and waited ten years before introducing the second generation of this nameplate at the 2015 North American International Auto Show. The three letters stood for New Sportscar eXperimental, and it was used for the first time on the supercar's first generation in 1990 for the 1991 model-year. It was a huge bet for Honda, and it worked. It was a daily driver supercar, and it proved worthy, especially after it was finely tuned by the legendary Formula 1 driver Ayrton Senna. With such high expectations, there's no wonder that Honda delayed the introduction of the NSX's second generation until 2015. But when it arrived, it stirred emotions until the last unit rolled out of the assembly line in 2022. The NSX was sold under the Honda badge for specific markets, while other countries knew it as Acura. Like its predecessor, the 2016 NSX was a mid-engined car with a short nose. Still, it featured an angular front fascia that sported slim LED headlights and a pentagonal-shaped grille flanked by broad side scoops. From its profile, the greenhouse sported an arched roofline that sloped down to the back of the vehicle, covering the engine compartment. In front of the rear wheel arches, the automaker installed the air intakes needed to cool the engine and feed it with air. Finally, at the back, Honda's design team installed LED taillights linked with a red strip. Despite the sporty exterior look, the cabin was luxurious. Even though it featured high-bolstered seats, these provided both comfort and side support. Between the car's occupants, the automaker installed a tall center console that hosted the buttons for the gearbox. There wasn't any shift lever or gear selector. Fronting the driver was a TFT that showed the speedometer in digits inside the round tachometer. The powertrain consisted of a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 helped by three motors: two at the front and one in the rear. Thanks to this setup, the car entered the supercar territory, even though the automaker said that it was mostly a gran tourer.",HONDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""NSX"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""mid-engined"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""luxurious"", ""angular"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""arched""],    ""grille"": [""pentagonal-shaped""],    ""hood"": [""short""],    ""headlights"": [""slim"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""rear""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloped"", ""arched""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""rear-mounted""]  }}```"
HONDA S660,"Honda's first automobile was the S500 in 1963 and the Japanese company produced open-top vehicles ever since. In 2015, it launched the 660 model, a car that was for the Japanese market. The kei-car culture in Japan is big. It represents small-sized vehicles with small engines. Some of them are just for daily commute with four doors and four seats. Other, like the Honda 660, are small, light, and nimble cars that can do both: be a daily driver with economic engines and provide fun on any twisty road. And, due to its low weight, it was a fun car that gathered attention to it. The little roadster was a mid-engine and rear-wheel-drive vehicle. Due to that concept, the car-manufacturer could move the cockpit forward and keep a very short overhang. It was something it couldn't do in a car with the engine in the front. On the front, there was the new company design with a lowered grille in the middle and the headlights as extensions of the grille. In the back, there was the same theme design. Inside there was room for two people. The cabin was focused on the driver, with a separating line on the passenger side. The instrument cluster was a carryover from the Honda CR-Z hybrid, with a central tachometer and a digital speedometer inside. The infotainment unit was placed high, on top of the dashboard. For the engine compartment, Honda installed a 3-cylinder turbocharged engine. It was mated as standard with a 6-speed manual. A CVT was offered as an option and, for that, there were paddle shifters behind the steering wheel with 7 preset gear ratios.",HONDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""660"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""small"", ""light"", ""nimble"", ""mid-engine"", ""rear-wheel-drive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""lowered""],    ""hood"": [""short overhang""],    ""headlights"": [""extensions of the grille""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""four"", ""roomy""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""turbocharged""]  }}```"
HONDA Prologue,"Honda introduced its first electric SUV in 2024, and despite not being a 100% Japanese product, it boasted enough features to be considered a genuine Honda. Several automakers worked together to create and develop reliable, trustworthy electric platforms. This was made so they could lower development costs and speed up the process. Honda Prologue is a good example of how to do badge engineering since, despite showing the Japanese brand’s H logo, it was a crossover based on the Ultium platform developed by General Motors. Even though it wasn’t a competitor for the Chevrolet Silverado EV, it shared some of its underpinnings. The car’s exterior revealed a front fascia dominated by a piano-black horizontal slat on the upper side where the brand’s logo took center stage. It was flanked by the LED headlights, which featured upper-mounted daytime running lights that doubled as turn signals. These looked like eyebrows, but they worked just fine for this mid-size crossover. Also, at the front, bystanders could notice the tall bumper fitted with a grille in the apron and flanked by vertical side scoops. From its profile, the Prologue looked sporty thanks to its slightly sloped-down roof and the ascending waistline that was curved up and ended onto the D-pillars. In addition, the raked-forward tailgate adorned with a roof spoiler created a dynamic image for Honda’s first electric crossover. Inside, customers were greeted with a minimalist-looking interior but rich in features. At the front, the high-mounted seats sported medium bolstering, so they couldn’t be named as sporty. Between them, Honda placed a center console with two cup holders and a storage compartment under the center armrest. On the dashboard, atop the center stack, the automaker placed the touchscreen for the infotainment unit, but it featured a physical volume button. A second color display sat in front of the driver and provided information about the vehicle’s speed, energy efficiency, and navigation. Moreover, Honda also installed a head-up display that helped the driver keep their eyes on the road while still seeing information about speed and navigation. In the back, Honda installed a split-folding (60/40) bench seat that was good for three adults, although headroom was nothing to write home about. Behind them, the Prologue had a large trunk, which customers could expand by folding down the rear seats. There was no frunk. Since it used the Ultium platform, the Prologue featured an in-floor mounted battery pack that fed the electric motors. The Japanese brand offered the crossover either as a front or as an all-wheel drive vehicle for selected markets. Another important detail for the Prologue is that it had independent suspensions in all corners, and Honda tuned the springs and dampers for a sportier feeling. After all, their car didn’t have to carry heavy loads, like the Silverado or the Blazer EV.",HONDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Prologue"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""dynamic"", ""minimalist"", ""trustworthy""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""tall"", ""fitted"", ""vertical""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""upper-mounted"", ""eyebrow-like""],    ""bumper"": [""tall"", ""fitted"", ""dominated""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloped-down"", ""curved"", ""ascending""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HONDA e:Ny1,"Honda introduced the e:Ny1 as its second full-electric vehicle in the spring of 2023, and even though the car was based on the already-known HR-V, it was different in many aspects. When the Japanese automaker introduced the e in 2020, it wasn't what its customers really wanted. While it was a vehicle packed with technology and able to run on electrons alone, its range was very small. Furthermore, it was quite expensive. But that was Honda's first baby steps into the EV segment. With the 2023 e:Ny1, things dramatically evolved. On the outside, the car's shape looked very familiar to many Honda owners since it shared most of its body panels with the HR-V crossover. At the front, though, the automaker removed the main grille since there wasn't any ICE to cool. It featured a panel instead, which concealed the vehicle's charging port. From its profile, the e:Ny1 featured the same raked-forward tailgate at the back and a clean design with curved panels and enough windows. While the exterior was a reminiscence of the HR-V, the interior was miles away. Fronting the driver was an LCD that showed the instrument panels. In addition, Honda placed a second, portrait-mode, 15.1” touchscreen that was divided into three areas. The one on the bottom was reserved for the HVAC unit, and it boasted touch areas. Since the e:Ny1 was based on the HR-V, Honda installed a similar-looking dashboard,] but with a different layout. All five seats in the cabin were comfortable for longer or shorter rides. Under the e:Ny1's skin Honda installed a 150 kW (204 hp) motor paired to a single-speed transmission that sent the electric motor torque to the front wheels only.",HONDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""e:Ny1"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""familiar shape"", ""clean exterior"", ""modern interior""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""curved""],    ""grille"": [""panel instead of grille""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""comfortable""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""electric motor""]  }}```"
HONDA e,"Honda introduced its first full-electric car on the market in 2020, following a concept that was unveiled by the Japanese automaker in 2017 at the Frankfurt Motor Show. The Japanese automaker was not on its first eco-friendly vehicle. Previously, it had the first-generation of the Insight in 1999, followed by other products such as the Civic Hybrid or the CR-V hybrid. But the e was the first fully electric one, but unfortunately, customers didn't share the carmaker's vision. In addition, the world pandemic and the microchip crisis led to very slow sales. On the outside, the design team tried to re-imagine the look of the first generation of the Civic. The e's round headlights that flanked the black panel between them and the minimalist exterior styling confirmed that. At the front, placed on the hood, the automaker installed the charging port, contradicting most other EVs on the market that had that installed on the rear quarter panels. One noticeable detail was the absence of the door mirrors, which were replaced by tiny rearview cameras. From its profile, the two-door hatchback sported a generous glass area, while at the back, the raked-forward C-pillars and tailgate ended the vehicle in a similar way as the 1972 Civic. Inside, the front seats provided ample room for two occupants, while those seated in the back had to deal with a much smaller place, suitable mostly for children. The completely digital dashboard featured a set of displays covered under the same glass cover, creating the illusion of a widescreen. Apart from that, two additional six-inch screens that showed the images from the rearview cameras were mounted on the outer edges of the dash panel. Honda offered the e with an electric motor available in two power versions: 100 kW and 113 kW (134 hp and 152 hp) that moved the rear wheels. The battery pack provided enough electricity for up to 225 km (140 miles).",HONDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Honda e"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""round headlights"", ""minimalist exterior styling"", ""generous glass area"", ""raked-forward C-pillars"", ""two-door hatchback""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""front-placed charging port""],    ""headlights"": [""round"", ""flanked by black panel""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""absence of door mirrors"", ""two-door""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HONDA ZR-V,"Since European customers were ready to buy any vehicle with a higher ground clearance than a sports sedan, in 2023, Honda introduced a new crossover on the market: the ZR-V. Slotted between the HR-V and the CR-V, this new model was not just an alternative for those looking for a compact hatchback but also a vehicle that could replace a station wagon Civic. Mind you, the eleventh generation of that well-known compact hatchback was not available in a long-roof version. The new model looked different than any other Honda. It featured a small front grille, compared to the rest of the front fascia, and a pair of LED headlights that had nothing in common with those installed on the Civic, at least from the aesthetic point of view. From its profile, it showed the flat hood and the tall greenhouse, which ended at the back with a raked-forward tailgate. At the rear fascia, the elongated LED taillights resembled those installed on the Civic, while the dual exhaust system sported rectangular tips on the lower side of the bumper. Since the ZR-V sported a shorter wheelbase than its compact hatchback sibling but featured a taller interior, the car could provide better legroom thanks to the high-mounted seats, both front and back. In addition, the front occupants were separated by a tall center console, which also housed a storage compartment at its bottom. The dashboard sported the same honeycomb pattern that concealed the vents, and Honda's infotainment system with a 9-inch touchscreen atop the center stack. Kudos to Honda for installing a turning knob for the sound system. Fronting the driver was a seven or 10.2” display for the instrument panel, depending on the trim level. Behind the rear split-folding bench seat, the ZR-V featured a 380 liter (13.4 cu-ft) trunk, which was 30 liters (1 cubic foot) smaller than in the Civic. But just like the European version of the Civic, the ZR-V was powered by a hybrid drivetrain with a 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle inline-four engine and an electric motor that drove the front wheels only.",HONDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""ZR-V"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""different"", ""compact"", ""tall"", ""elongated"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""tall""],    ""grille"": [""small""],    ""hood"": [""flat""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""distinctive""],    ""bumper"": [""elongated"", ""dual-exhaust""],    ""wheel"": [""shorter wheelbase""],    ""doors"": [""high-mounted seats""],    ""roof"": [""tall greenhouse""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""rectangular tips""]  }}```"
HYUNDAI Santa Fe,"Hyundai shook the world in 2023 when it introduced the fifth generation of its Santa Fe SUV, surprising its competitors with a bold-looking vehicle that was completely different than its predecessors. Moreover, not only that it was a larger vehicle, but it was more luxurious and garnished with all the bells and whistles that an upscale car could offer. Still, it wasn't considered a premium SUV but a mass-market one. One that could've been used on a daily urban commute and on weekends for a camping trip. Hyundai was eager to introduce the fifth generation of the Santa Fe. The Korean automaker sent the previous generation to retirement after just five years, which was uncommon for the car's segment. But seeing the new model, it was quite understandable. The fifth Santa Fe offered a demanding look on the road, featuring a flat front fascia. Its headlights were dispersed in an unusual pattern and connected by a light strip that crossed the car's main grille from side to side. Gone were the rounded, soft shapes of its predecessor. The 2024 Santa Fe featured straight cuts for the lower side intakes and the lower grille. Moreover, from its profile, the SUV boasted flared wheel arches that created the impression of a rugged off-road vehicle. To make the car look more dynamic, the designers made a slightly descending roof line, and the last two pillars were almost vertical. But while the front and the sides of the vehicle looked very bold, the rear fascia didn't impress too much due to its lower light panel that crossed the tailgate. The proportions between the glass area and the metallic panels were not that much pleasant. But it was a form that followed function, and for that, Hyundai had to be forgiven. Inside, the almost vertical side panels and the long cabin offered plenty of room for those who loved camping in nature and didn't want to sleep in a tent. The Santa Fe was available with two or three rows of seats, and by folding all but the first ones, it created a completely flat surface where at least two people could sleep in comfort. For daily use, though, the automaker prepared a well-equipped dashboard with a digital instrument cluster for the driver and a 12.3"" touchscreen placed atop the center stack for the infotainment system. These two formed a panoramic curved display with a seamless integration behind the same piece of glass. Fortunately, the main audio controls and the HVAC unit kept their physical buttons in place. Under the hood, Hyundai installed a choice of two hybrid drivetrains powered by either a 1.6-liter or a 2.5-liter gasoline unit. Both were carried over from the previous generation of the Santa Fe.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Santa Fe"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""larger"",  ""overall-design"": [""bold"", ""luxurious"", ""rugged"", ""dynamic"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""flat""],    ""grille"": [""unusual"", ""connected"", ""main""],    ""hood"": [""straight""],    ""headlights"": [""dispersed"", ""unusual""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""flared""],    ""doors"": [""vertical""],    ""roof"": [""descending""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI Sonata,"Hyundai refreshed the eighth generation of the Sonata at the beginning of 2023 for the 2024 model-year, thus improving the car's look both on the inside and the outside. The Korean automaker refreshed the Sonata after four years after the launch of the eighth generation of this model. Even though its styling was not outdated nor dull, the mid-size sedan had already started to show its age. Furthermore, the technological package was also updated, with a new infotainment system and a new dashboard and instrument panel. Thanks to its continuous light strip across the front fascia, the refreshed eighth generation of the Sonata looked like it was ready for the future. All the other main components of the front fascia were placed underneath that signature light. On the sides, the LED headlights were above side scoops while the main grille took center stage, adorned with a hexagonal pattern. From its profile, the fastback silhouette was just an illusion since the vehicle was a three-box sedan but with a raked forward rear windscreen. Inside, the most striking new element was the dashboard. Hyundai installed a new combo of an instrument panel and infotainment unit, both being protected by the same glass panel. This idea was already present in other Hyundai models, such as the Elantra of the Ioniq6. Both displays wore the same 12.5” diagonal size, and the result was spectacular. The door panels looked like they sported a slightly altered design. At the same time, the seats were available with new upholstery colors. Yet, in the back, adults had some problems with the headroom.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Sonata"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""mid-size sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""futuristic"", ""elegant""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked forward""],    ""grille"": [""hexagonal pattern""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""slightly altered design""],    ""roof"": [""fastback silhouette illusion""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI i10,"Hyundai introduced the third generation of its i10 city car in 2019, and four years later, it announced the facelifted version for it at the beginning of March 2023. The smallest member of Hyundai's family is the i10. This small city vehicle is based on the same platform as the Kia Picanto and tries to get a slice of the segment competing against French and Italian cars in Europe and against Japanese brands in India and Asia. So, to keep it fresh in front of its customers, the Korean automaker improved the pocket-sized hatchback and even gave it an N Line, which was inspired by the performance N-badged Hyundais. On the front fascia, the 2023 i10 sported a new grille that incorporated the LED daytime running lights, with three oblique lines for the N Line and four horizontal blocks for the rest of the range. Furthermore, the bumper looked different between these two siblings, with the sportier one featuring a broad grille extended to the lower lip spoiler flanked by horizontal scoops, while regular i10s had fake vertical vents that hosted the fog lamps. The interior of the facelifted version of the Hyundai's small-sized vehicle featured a wide, dual-screen display on the dashboard, with a touchscreen atop the center stack for the infotainment system and a TFT for the instrument panel. There was new fabric upholstery on the refreshed i10, depending on the trim level. Like its predecessor, the 2023 version offered enough room for four adults and a small trunk behind the flat-folding rear bench seat.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""i10"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""pocket-sized"", ""fresh"", ""sporty"", ""compact"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""new"", ""incorporated LED"", ""oblique lines"", ""horizontal blocks"", ""broad grille""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED daytime running""],    ""bumper"": [""different"", ""sportier"", ""lower lip spoiler"", ""horizontal scoops"", ""fake vertical vents""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI Elantra N,"Hyundai refreshed the seventh generation of the Elantra, and along with it, it brought some updates to the Elantra N version, which was the most powerful and the sportiest from its family. Gone were the days when the Elantra was a mundane grocery-getter vehicle. By 2023, it became not just the best-selling Hyundai model of all time but also a threat to other automakers in the same segment. But the Korean automaker dared even more when it made the N version for the i30 and the Elantra. This time, the Elantra was a true contender against other sport compact vehicles on the market. Moreover, the refreshed version, or PE (Product Enhanced), as Hyundai liked to name it, came with several improvements in the safety department. First, the exterior was modified so the car could show its potential. Hyundai installed new headlights on the entire lineup, featuring slimmer LED daytime running lights on their upper side. On the Elantra N, these were visually connected via a black stripe and a body-colored slat above the main black grille. Underneath it, the automaker installed exclusively for the Elantra N a mate black trim on the bumper, which was continued on the lower side by an A-shaped cooling area flanked by a pair of side scoops needed to vent the front brakes. The aggressive look on the car's front fascia was emphasized by the lower bumper, which sported a red lip spoiler at the bottom. One particular element of this version of the Elantra was the carmaker's logo placed on the hood. While the rest of the range featured silver ones, this one was black. From its profile, the Elantra N boasted its forged, black, 19"" alloy wheels. At the back, the automaker made an H-design with the vertical lights of the taillights and a horizontal red strip that crossed the rear fascia. The car's sporty image was completed by the small spoiler on the trunk lid and two side-mounted exhausts underneath the bumper, flanking the diffuser. Inside, the Elantra N boasted high-bolstered bucket seats with integrated headrests and cut-aways for four-point harnesses. Still, since the vehicle was designed for street use, those were mostly just for decoration. In front of the driver, the automaker installed a digital instrument cluster that showed two large dials for the tachometer and speedometer flanking the area reserved for the computer to display various information about the car's status. Atop the center stack, a 10.25"" touchscreen for the infotainment unit featured wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. Between the front occupants, the center console housed the selector for the automatic transmission and the button for the parking brake, which for the 2024 model-year was electric instead of a mechanic. In the back, the 60/40 split-folding bench seat could accommodate three adult-sized passengers. The Elantra N PE featured advanced safety features such as adaptive cruise control and side airbags for the rear seats. Under the hood, the Korean automaker installed its already famous two-liter turbocharged powerplant that sent 276 HP to the front wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. Moreover, for short periods, the car could deliver up to 286 HP.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Elantra N"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""sporty"", ""aggressive"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black"", ""slim"", ""body-colored""],    ""hood"": [""black logo""],    ""headlights"": [""new"", ""slimmer LED""],    ""bumper"": [""mate black trim"", ""red lip spoiler"", ""A-shaped cooling area""],    ""wheel"": [""forged"", ""black"", ""19-inch alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""flanking exhausts""],    ""spoiler"": [""small""],    ""exhaust"": [""side-mounted""]  }}```"
HYUNDAI Elantra Sedan,"Hyundai revealed the refreshed version of the Elantra's seventh generation, trying to make it more upscale, and gave it an aggressive stance. The Korean automaker targeted young customers with families, and its recipe worked well. After all, the Elantra was Hyundai's best-selling product. The Korean automaker dubbed its facelifted model PE, as in Product Enhanced. Still, that was not just a marketing line but an actual fact. Not only did the exterior and the interior improve, but also the car's features, the engine lineup, and even the car's key went through an evolutionary process. As a result, the Elantra became more appealing and remained fresh on the market. At the front, the headlights' design was enhanced and featured exclusively LED lamps inside them. The daytime running light that looked like eyebrows for the vehicle was continued on the car's upper grille by a chromed horizontal slat. On the lower side, the bumper featured a few sculptured lines that formed the central air intake and the side scoops, like on a sports car. Yet, the Elantra has always been a family vehicle. From its profile, the sculptured door panels and fenders kept their lines as on the non-refreshed version, while at the back, the automaker emphasized the H-pattern with a red horizontal strip that crossed the rear fascia from side to side, visually connecting the taillights. Inside, the driver fronted a redesigned 4.2” digital instrument cluster that showed the tachometer, the speedometer, and other information gathered from the onboard computer for fuel consumption, range, and various notifications for the vehicle's status. In addition, atop the center stack, Hyundai installed a 10.25” touchscreen for the infotainment unit that was complemented by a Bose premium sound system. This screen was standard from the SEL trims and above, while the Bose was reserved for the Limited and N-Line grades. The new infotainment system was compatible with a digital key running on either Android or iPhone. Despite being a family vehicle, the automaker installed contoured bolstered seats at the front, while at the back, there was room enough for three adults on the 60/40 split-folding bench seat. Hyundai also made a significant upgrade in the safety department by installing standard side airbags for the rear passengers on all trim levels. Under the hood, the automaker installed a choice of gasoline engines. The base model was a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated unit, followed by a 1.6-liter turbocharged and a 1.6-liter hybrid system. The 2.0-liter turbocharged unit was reserved exclusively for the Elantra N, the model's top performer. For the transmission, Hyundai placed its bets on a CVT (continuous variable transmission) for selected versions, while others got a dual-clutch gearbox. As usual for Hyundai, power went to the front wheels only, and there was no option for an all-wheel-drive system.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Elantra"",  ""year"": ""refreshed seventh generation"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""upscale"", ""aggressive"", ""family-friendly"", ""fresh"", ""appealing""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""chromed"", ""horizontal"", ""sculptured""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""enhanced"", ""LED"", ""eyebrow-like"", ""exclusive""],    ""bumper"": [""sculptured"", ""sports car-like""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI Kona Electric,"Hyundai introduced the second generation of the Kona at the beginning of 2023 for the 2024 model year, which at first, like its predecessor, was only available as an EV. After testing the market with the first generation of the Kona, followed by the Ioniq5 and Ioniq6, the second generation of its B-segment SUV came as a logical step. But, unlike its predecessor, it put more emphasis on the design language. Thus, the second generation of this vehicle looked like a proper EV, not a converted version of an ICE. On the front fascia, the design team installed a slim LED strip that crossed the vehicle from side to side above the bumper. In the lower area, on the apron, Hyundai placed a trapezoidal-shaped grille that was tall enough to cool the battery pack and motors, flanked by LED headlights. On the sides, the ascending sculptured line made on the doors, combined with another one that started from the front fenders, created a dynamic look for the SUV. On the N-line trim level, the Kona sported black door mirrors. Inside, Hyundai placed a 12.3"" dual-screen on the dashboard. The one fronting the driver was used for the instrument panel, while the one placed atop the center stack was for the infotainment system. In addition, a 12"" projection on the windshield helped the driver navigate without taking their eyes from the road. Its front bucket seats provided little bolstering and were made mostly from recycled materials. In the back, the bench seat could accommodate three passengers on short jaunts or two for long travels. The automaker offered the Kona with a choice of two motors and two battery packs.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Kona"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""B-segment SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""proper EV design"", ""dynamic look""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""12\"" projection""],    ""grille"": [""trapezoidal-shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""slim LED strip""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""ascending sculptured line"", ""black door mirrors""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI Palisade,"Hyundai's flagship SUV, the Palisade, received an upgrade in 2022 and improved the vehicle both on the inside and the outside. When Hyundai unveiled the Palisade at the 2018 Los Angeles Auto Show, it offered a feasible alternative to other premium SUVs, at least in terms of features and amenities. But the carmaker didn't stop, and in the first half of 2022, it released a facelifted version, which came with improvements in most areas. Yet, the overall shape was still the same. At the front, the grille was wider and sported a cascading design, as they put it. However, its five horizontal slats and the chromed elements that adorned the front fascia, and the reshaped vertical headlights offered more of an Escalade-like appearance. At the back, the bumper got a new design, with a red stripe crossing it from left to right, above the silver-painted underbody shield. Inside, Hyundai stepped up its game, and the third row offered heating for passengers, a first for the Korean carmaker. Moreover, the second row provided heated and ventilated seats for enhanced comfort. But the carmaker didn't focus only on comfort but also enhanced the safety by offering nine airbags fitted as standard, as compared to seven for its predecessor. Under the hood, Hyundai installed the same 3.8-liter V6 engine that ran in Atkinson Cycle mode for improved fuel efficiency and was paired to the same eight-speed automatic gearbox. Unlike its predecessor, though, it provided a Tow Mode for the electronically controlled all-wheel drive system.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Palisade"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""feaseable"", ""premium"", ""facelifted"", ""improved"", ""wider""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wider"", ""cascading"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""reshaped"", ""vertical""],    ""bumper"": [""red-striped"", ""silver-painted""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI i20,"Created on the same Hundai-Kia K2 platform as the Kia Ceed, the i20 was shorter and less expensive than its i30 sibling and a better alternative for that, especially in the urban environment. The third generation of the i20 came at the beginning of 2020, and its planned launch at the Geneva Motor Show was canceled due to the world pandemic. Still, its sales were good enough to keep it alive since it was a budget vehicle. As a result, Hyundai kept it alive and gave it a facelift in the spring of 2023. It was another contest of the ""spot the differences"" test made by the Korean automaker. There were hardly any noticeable differences between the 2020 and the 2023 model years for the i20. Still, the front bumper on the newer version featured new side scoops with additional wing-shaped edges. The profile remained the same, and, at the back, the facelifted version sported amber lenses over the blinkers instead of white and dynamic lights for the Z-shaped taillights. In addition, customers had the option to choose from new 16 or 17 inches light-alloy wheels. Inside, the most significant upgrade was for the instrument cluster that sported a standard 4.2"" LCD, with an option for a 10.25"" one, like its non-facelifted sibling. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto were already common-sense features for all Korean automakers, so Hyundai remembered to add these to the menu. Still, unlike the 2020 model year, the new version boasted LED interior lights and an option for a Bose sound system. Kia offered the i20 with a one-liter inline-three gasoline engine available in two power options. Both of them could be paired with either a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox or a six-speed manual.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""i20"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""shorter"", ""urban-friendly"", ""budget-friendly"", ""facelifted"", ""minimal differences""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""dynamic"", ""Z-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [""front"", ""new side scoops"", ""wing-shaped edges""],    ""wheel"": [""16 or 17 inches light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI i30,"After a successful start in 2016, the compact hatchback from Hyundai, the i30, has received a facelift in February 2020 with a new design, signed by Peter Schreyer. The former designer from Audi-Volkswagen, Peter Schreyer, was in charge of the design for the whole Kia-Hyundai range after its arrival in the Korean group in 2006. His ideas completely changed the way these two brands look and, as a consequence, the sales rocketed. And he tried its hand, again, with the facelift for the i30. On the front of the 2020 i30, there was a new bumper with a more aggressive design. A larger grille with a new design for the mesh was introduced. A new pair of headlights with built-in daytime LED running lights. Apart from the N-Line that featured black mesh on the front, the rest of the range featured classic, chromed elements. In the back, the new taillights received new LED graphics. Inside, the 2020 i30 received an improved infotainment system with a 10.25” screen, which was a carry-over from the Kona and Ioniq. For the instrument cluster, a 7” TFT display replaced the analog dials. While the aesthetic was little changed, the engine compartment received new units. The 2020 model received a new mil-hybrid version. For the transmission, Hyundai offered a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch system.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""i30"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""classic"", ""improved"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""larger"", ""new""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""new"", ""built-in"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""aggressive"", ""new""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI Kona,"Hyundai developed the second generation of the Kona from the ground up to accommodate either electric or internal combustion engines, and the U.S. version broke covers on the 2023 NYIAS. The Korean automaker focused on EV production but still knew that it had to keep the internal combustion versions on the assembly lines. As a result, it came up with a smart idea: a platform that could get both kinds of engines and room to spare for battery packs. The only thing that it couldn't solve was a design to fit both versions. Thus, the dinosaur-juice-powered version looked more like an EV with a grille at the front rather than a proper ICE vehicle. At the front, the vehicle sported the same signature LED light strip that ran from side to side. Underneath it, the redesigned bumper accommodated a broad opening for the radiator's grille, flanked on the sides by the same headlights with amber blinkers as on the Kona EV. From its profile, the B-segment crossover featured sculptured door panels and black, unpainted cladding that surrounded the wheel arches and adorned the side sills. At the same time, at the back, the taillights were placed on the outer sides of the quarter panels. Hyundai created a modern interior for the Kona, with two 12.3"" displays on the dashboard. The one fronting the driver was for the instrument panel, while the one placed atop the center stack was for the infotainment system. In addition, a 12"" HUD offered additional information to the driver, so they didn't need to take their eyes off the road. The vehicle provided enough room for five occupants on short jaunts, but on longer trips, the narrow bench seat in the back was not exactly comfortable for three adults. The Kona's gasoline-powered version was available with a choice of two powerplants: a 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle and a 1.6-liter turbocharged and direct fuel-injected version paired with a CVT or an 8-speed automatic tranny, respectively.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Kona"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""B-segment crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""modern"", ""sculptured"", ""black"", ""unpainted"", ""signature""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""front"", ""broad"", ""redesigned""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""amber""],    ""bumper"": [""broad opening""],    ""wheel"": [""arches""],    ""doors"": [""sculptured"", ""black"", ""unpainted""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI i30 N,"Hyundai shocked the world when it introduced the i30 N version in 2017. The 250 hp hot-hatch was fitted with all the amenities to tackle the other cars from its class, but it was updated in 2020. After Hyundai decided to enter the World Rally Championship to get more promotion, even though it wasn't the fastest or the best hot-hatch on the market, it was a beginning. Three years later, it brought an enhanced version of the i30 N. The designers took a second look at the car's details and improved most of them. They made the car looks more aggressive. At the front, the N-signature was visible on the grille. The N-logo was integrated into the wheel-caps as well. The LED-headlights with V-shaped daytime running lights enhanced the look. On the sides, the side-sills were designed to improve the aerodynamic. Hyundai installed a revised interior for the 2020 model year and enhanced the instrument cluster with LED lights that changed their colors according to the oil temperature and raised the tachometer's red line. Between the two large dials, the TFT color display showed the information for the car's status. Under the hood, the 2020 i30 N featured a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine with direct-fuel injection. It offered 280 hp, five hp more than the non-facelifted version. It was mated as standard with a 6-speed manual that sent the power to the front wheel. Hyundai offered an automatic 8-speed transmission and an electronically controlled Limited Slip Differential.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""i30 N"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""enhanced"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""N-signature""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""V-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""N-logo""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""turbocharged"", ""direct-fuel injection""]  }}```"
HYUNDAI ix35 / Tucson,"In 2004, Hyundai introduced the first generation of its compact-segment SUV, the Tucson. By 2020, it reached its fourth generation, which it unveiled in September 2020. Hyundai introduced the U.S. version of the Tucson in early November 2020 as a 2022 model year. It offered it only with the long-wheelbase version, which was longer, wider, and taller than its predecessor. It also offered some other market-specific features such as the XM Satellite Radio or the fenders' brake-lights. The 2022 Hyundai Tucson looked more like an SUV coupe than a regular, compact-sized, cross-over vehicle. Its huge grille at the front featured a 3-D design and headlights that showed like those found on some concept-cars. But it was a production model. The front bumper featured two wide scoops on the outer sides and a smaller grille on the apron's bottom. Inside, Hyundai struggled to offer more for its customers. The flat and low dashboard followed a minimalist design, with a grille-like line placed on its upper side. It was a unique design on the market due to its TFT display for the instrument cluster and the 10.25” full touch-screen on the center stack. The Tucson offered a futuristic look for its time, even though most customers from various brands preferred normal buttons and knobs instead of touch-buttons. Thanks to its longer wheelbase, the U.S. version of the Korean SUV provided more legroom for the rear passengers. The 2022 Hyundai Tucson offered both a 2.5-liter, direct-injected, and multi-port-injected gasoline engine and a 1.6-liter, direct-injected, turbocharged hybrid, and plug-in hybrid powertrains. They were mated to an 8-speed automatic gearbox, and the power went to all four corners, or just to the front wheels.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Hyundai Tucson"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""long-wheelbase, longer, wider, taller"",  ""overall-design"": [""SUV coupe"", ""futuristic"", ""unique"", ""minimalist"", ""3-D grille""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""huge"", ""3-D design""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""concept-car-like""],    ""bumper"": [""wide scoops"", ""smaller grille""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI i30 Estate,"The compact segment vehicles were built in all shapes, including the station-wagon. Hyundai i30 Wagon came late to the party, but it didn't come unprepared. Peter Schreyer took a big challenge when he moved to Hyundai-Kia after a successful career at Audi. He was responsible for designing the first generation of the TT and, for the Korean brands, responsible for the entire lineup. His ideas worked wonders for Hyundai, and, in 2011, he refreshed the i30 lineup look. On the front of the 2020 i30 Wagon, there was a new bumper with a more aggressive design. A larger grille with a new design for the mesh was introduced. A new pair of headlights with built-in daytime LED running lights. Apart from the N-Line that featured black mesh on the front, the rest featured classic, chromed elements. In the back, the new taillights received new. V-shaped LED graphics to match the front daytime running lights. The raked D-pillars might remind those of the Audi A4 Avant. A roof-spoiler was installed on top of the tailgate. Inside, the 2020 i30 Wagon received an improved infotainment system with a 10.25"" screen, a carry-over from the Kona and Ioniq. For the instrument cluster, a 7"" TFT display replaced the analog dials. It offered Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Since the roofline was longer, the rear passengers didn't have a problem with the headroom. Like on the rest of the range, the split-folding back seat seatback extended the trunk area. While the aesthetic was little changed, the engine compartment received new units. The 2020 model received a new mil-hybrid version. For the transmission, Hyundai offered a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch system.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Hyundai i30 Wagon"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""refreshed"", ""improved"", ""longer roofline"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""larger"", ""new design"", ""classic, chromed elements""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""new pair"", ""built-in daytime LED running lights""],    ""bumper"": [""more aggressive design""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""roof-spoiler"", ""longer roofline""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof-spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI Ioniq,"The Korean carmaker introduced the second generation of its electric Ioniq 5 model at the beginning of 2021 with a CUV-like appearance and a stunning design. Ioniq 5 was based on the Hyundai 45 EV design study and resembled the 45 years brand's history. It was built on the E-GMP platform that brought a longer wheelbase and featured a more muscular appearance. The sci-fi design and angular-sculptured side panels paved the way for a Korean carmaker's new design language. Hyundai's first car on the market was the 1975 Pony designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, and the 2021 Ioniq 5 took its inspiration from that model. At the front, the clam-shell design continued to minimize the grille and pushed the company's logo on the hood. From its sides, the huge wheelbase for its car category led to a spacious interior. Inside, Hyundai took the minimalist design to a different level. The dashboard was divided into an upper and lower section, with just a few buttons on the center stack. There was a 12"" TFT display for the instrument panel in front of the driver and, in the middle of the dash panel, an additional 12"" screen for the infotainment system. Both of them were mounted on a shared board. The front passenger's seat featured a foot-rest to enjoy more comfort on longer journeys. There was room for three passengers in the rear, and, thanks to the completely flat floor and the 3.0-meters (118"") wheelbase, they all had enough legroom. The carmaker offered the 2021 Ioniq 5 with two power options. Customers could choose between a rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive solution or two motors (one on each axle). Also, the carmaker offered two battery options. Another important innovation was the electric system, which allowed high-voltage and high-power charging stations of up to 800 volts.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ioniq 5"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""CUV-like"",  ""overall-design"": [""stunning"", ""muscular"", ""sci-fi"", ""minimalist"", ""spacious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""minimized""],    ""hood"": [""clam-shell""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""huge"", ""longer wheelbase""],    ""doors"": [""minimalist""],    ""roof"": [""angular-sculptured""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI i30 Fastback,"After a successful start in 2016, the compact hatchback from Hyundai, the i30, has received a facelift for the 2020 model-year with a new design, signed by Peter Schreyer. The former designer from Audi-Volkswagen, Peter Schreyer, was in charge of the whole Kia-Hyundai range after it arrived in the Korean group in 2006. His ideas completely changed the way these two brands look and, as a consequence, the sales rocketed. And he tried its hand, again, with the facelift for the i30. On the front of the 2020 i30 fastback, there was a new bumper with a more aggressive design. A larger grille with a new design for the mesh was introduced. A new pair of headlights with built-in daytime LED running lights. Apart from the N-Line that featured black mesh on the front, the rest featured classic, chromed elements.

HYUNDAI i20 Active,"The crossover small-segment was in high demand, and Hyundai tried to keep its momentum with a refreshed i20 Active that offered a few technological evolutions. Hyundai introduced the i20 lineup in 2014 as its small-segment contender, between the city-segment i10 and the compact-sized i30. It was a suitable choice for a commuter vehicle that spent most of its time in city traffic. The i20 Active featured the same bodywork as the i20 5-door hatchback but added specific molds from the outside. The front bumper featured an expansive, center, trapezoidal plastic mold that mimicked an aluminum shield. On the sides, the carmaker installed a set of black side-sills, which were better to stop other people's doors in the parking lot than any rock or off-road obstacle. The designers installed a redesigned bumper with a silver plastic shield underneath and two fog-lights on the outer sides in the rear. Inside, the most significant change was the 7"" touch-screen that took center stage of the dash, surrounded by a few buttons. It was Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatible. Like in the regular i20, the climate control buttons resembled some German car. The i20 offered good interior room for four adults and a split-folding rear bench seatback that could expand the trunk area. While in an i10 that might be necessary for the weekly shopping, the i20 was didn't need if there were just two people in the house and a pet. Hyundai installed a 1.4-liter, naturally aspirated gasoline engine paired to a six-speed manual under the i20 Active hood. It provided 100 hp, and it worked better at low-revs in city traffic.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""i20 Active"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""technological"", ""suitable"", ""redesigned"", ""spacious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""trapezoidal"", ""expansive""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""fog-lights"", ""redesigned""],    ""bumper"": [""center"", ""silver"", ""redesigned""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""black side-sills""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI i40 wagon,"The updated version of the Hyundai i40 Wagon is a clear statement of the Korean manufacturer regarding the European market. It represents an alternative for the well-established D-segment station wagons. Their target was to build a vehicle with a touch of luxury at affordable prices. Its suspension was tuned for fast driving and installed with up to 18” light-alloy wheels on it. The most important modifications were made under the hood, where Euro6d engines were installed. It offers gasoline and turbodiesel versions, with outputs ranging from 115 hp up to 178 hp, depending on the market. Standard gearboxes are 6-speed manuals and a 6-speed automatic with paddle shifters is offered as an option. A new, 7-speed DCT (dual-clutch) gearbox was available for the facelifted version, but only for the diesel units. The platform is the same as for the Hyundai Sonata, with four-wheel independent suspension. The 2.77 m (109 in) wheelbase is fit for a spacious interior. The trunk space is 553 liters (19.5 cu.ft) and can be extended by folding the rear seats up to 1719 liters (60.7 cu.ft). After it was released as a facelift, sales didn't go well and the vehicle was withdrawn from several markets, including Australia and U.K. For the sedan version, the Sonata took the market share from the i40.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Hyundai i40 Wagon"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""spacious"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""affordable"", ""fast-driving""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""well-established""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""18-inch light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI Veloster,"The second generation Hyundai Veloster came out in 2018 featuring a new design and a fresh interior along with better engines and more features. Much of the redesign is derived from enhanced proportions and volume; the new shape clearly conveys focused dynamic performance, even standing still. Its stance is more muscular, with higher-volume fenders and wheel arches for a more planted appearance. The cowl point and A-pillar are further rearward and now connect the hood line and belt line into an integrated, powerful gesture. The asymmetrical design carries through to the interior, with a driver-focused interior layout and on the Turbo Ultimate, a contrasting color environment that visually separates the driving cockpit. Each trim level has unique colors, materials, and accents, further differentiating each model with varying hues and textures. The level of standard safety features was exceptional, as the Velosters were offered with a Vehicle Stability Management, ESC, and Motor Driven Power Steering. The car was equipped with 6 airbags and a magnificent braking package including four-wheel disc brakes and ABS with brake assist (applies maximum braking force in case of emergency detected) and EBD which automatically adjusted the braking force to the front and the rear axles depending on the loading conditions. The colors available for the Velosters were Ultra Black, Chalk White, Sonic Silver, Thunder Gray, Sunset Orange, Racing Red and Space Gray.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Hyundai Veloster"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""enhanced proportions"",  ""overall-design"": [""muscular stance"", ""asymmetrical design"", ""driver-focused interior""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""integrated, powerful gesture""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""higher-volume fenders"", ""planted appearance""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [],    ""interior"": [""contrasting color environment"", ""unique colors and materials""]  }}```"
HYUNDAI Sonata Hybrid,"The seventh generation of the Sonata charged the market in 2014, and the carmaker promised a hybrid and a plug-in hybrid version, which were introduced later on. In 2017, the entire Sonata lineup received an update that marked the car's change toward a pre-premium segment. It wasn't the budget-buy bargain anymore, but it was a technologically advanced vehicle enclosed into a refined vehicle. Its exterior was very similar to the rest of the 2017 Sonata range. The drag coefficient was improved to a class-leading 0.24 Cd, thanks to its fluid lines and sculptured doors and side panels. At the front, the cascade-grille design and the side-scoops were meant to divert the flow and made it ran smoother on the car's surface. In the rear, behind the sloped windscreen, the carmaker installed a profiled trunk lid that prevented turbulences behind the vehicle. Apart from the roof, Hyundai changed every other body panel. Inside, the carmaker added a few modifications to match the exterior's new look. Its instrument panel design and the three-spoke steering wheel were slightly enhanced, while the piano key buttons for the audio and HVAC controls gave a premium look for the center stack. For the drivetrain, Hyundai installed a 2.0-liter, direct-injected gasoline engine. It produced 154 hp and a 38 kW electric engine helped it. When combined, the two engines provided 193 hp, which were sent to the front wheels via a six-speed automatic transmission.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Sonata"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""mid-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""fluid lines"", ""sculptured doors"", ""pre-premium segment"", ""technologically advanced"", ""refined""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""cascade""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [""profiled""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI Accent Sedan,"The fifth generation of the Hyundai Accent was introduced at the Orange County International Auto Show. The car's evolution showed an increase in dimensions and practicality. The Hyundai Accent stepped-up with more High Strength Steel made by the Hyundai steel factories. Due to intensive use of HSS, less steel material was required but the final result was a 32% stronger body and only 11 kg (22 lbs) more weight added to the unibody construction. When viewed from some angles, the 2017  Accent looked like a shrunken Sonata. But, despite being smaller than the executive Hyundai sedan, it kept some nice proportions and elegance. Usually, the four-door, small class, vehicles don't look very well. Their forms are compromised by the difference between the tall greenhouse and the rest of the bodywork. On the fifth generation of the Accent, even the big cascading grille looked good. The interior was modern and well-equipped for its era. It featured a clean instrument cluster with analog round dials. For the infotainment system, there was a standard 5” TFT display on the center console. A bigger, 7” unit was offered as an option. Also, the backup camera was offered as standard. For the engine compartment, the 2017 Accent up to four gasoline and three diesel units, depending on the market. The standard transmission was a 6-speed manual, while a 6-speed automatic, a 7-speed dual-clutch and a CVT were offered as an option.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Hyundai Accent"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""small class"",  ""overall-design"": [""practical"", ""elegant"", ""modern"", ""well-equipped"", ""strong""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""practical""],    ""grille"": [""big"", ""cascading""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI Elantra GT,"With the first generation of Elantra GT released in 2012, 5 years after, Hyundai redesigns it and reveals the 2nd generation. The Elantra GT was a smart hatchback that offered more cargo space than a small sedan. So instead of going for a crossover, the choice of getting the Elantra GT would have been quite as good. The Elantra GT was powered by a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine that produced 173 hp, mated with a 6-speed manual transmission. The automatic transmission was optional and at an extra cost of around $1,000. The small 4-door hatchback was available in a single trim level that could be improved with the two available extra packages. The standard features included were 16-inch steel wheels, heated mirrors, air conditioning, cruise control, a cooled glovebox, Bluetooth connectivity and a 6-speaker sounds system. Overall, the standard version offered great features that could be enough for the daily driving. One of the available packages was the Value Edition designed to add more luxury overall feel. The package included 17-inch alloys, a tweaked suspension, automatic headlights, foglight, keyless ignition and entry, along with leather upholstery and heated front seats. The Tech package included a 7-inch screen, a rearview camera, a panoramic sunroof, ventilated from seats, integrated Android Auto and Apple CarPlat, as well as dual-zone automatic climate control and a navigation system.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Elantra GT"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""small 4-door hatchback"",  ""overall-design"": [""smart"", ""functional"", ""compact"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""automatic"", ""sleek""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""16-inch steel"", ""17-inch alloys""],    ""doors"": [""4-door""],    ""roof"": [""panoramic""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI Grandeur / Azera,"Sold as the Grandeur in Korea and as Azera on the export markets, Hyundai's flagship model reached its seventh generation six years after the launch of its predecessor. When the Korean automaker introduced the 2022 Azera, it blurred the lines between its flagship model and the Genesis brand products, Hyundai's premium brand. The new top-shelf vehicle tried to attract more customers from other premium brands and carmakers that provided vehicles in the same price range. Still, they didn't offer the same level of performance and luxury. For starters, the design was highly advanced for its era. It featured an LED strip named Seamless Horizon Lamp that ran across the entire front fascia from side to side. It was placed above the parametrically designed grille that was flanked by headlights. The vehicle's profile revealed its retractable door handles and the curved beltline that connected the front daytime running lights to the rear taillights. Moreover, the greenhouse emphasized the luxurious appearance by adding a third window behind the rear doors. Finally, at the back, the Azera featured another light strip from side to side like the front one; only this one was red. The cabin boasted premium and sustainable materials to create a warm and welcoming interior. Translated into regular words, it featured man-made leather and recycled materials for the front bucket seats and the rear bench. Thanks to its generous wheelbase, the Azera provided plenty of legroom for rear passengers. The dash panel featured a neatly integrated digital instrument panel, continued by a touchscreen display for the infotainment system. Another screen was placed under the dashboard and above the center console for the HVAC unit. In a way, it resembled the design of older Hyundai vehicles.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Azera"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""generous wheelbase"",  ""overall-design"": [""advanced"", ""luxurious"", ""premium"", ""sustainable"", ""welcoming""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""parametrically designed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""flanked""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""retractable handles""],    ""roof"": [""curved beltline"", ""greenhouse with third window""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI Elantra 5 Doors,"The 5-door version of the popular 4-door sedan, the Hyundai Elantra GT was a compact hatchback that delivered on fuel economy and affordability. While based on the sedan body style, the new Elantra GT had a shorter wheelbase. Even with the shorter wheelbase, it still offered more maximum cargo volume than others competitors in the segment such as the Ford Focus, the Mazda 3 and others. Aesthetically, the Elantra GT featured flowing lines and sculpted angles, with the functional design turning it into a more aerodynamic vehicle than the Subaru Impreza. Fitted with a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine, the hatchback had 148 hp under the hood. The unit was mated with a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Inside, the Hyundai Elantra GT featured a modern design. The two round gauges behind the wheel were easy to read and all controls were intuitively placed and within easy reach. Wearing the GT badge, the Elantra featured some technical modifications to make it sportier. The new model featured driver selectable steering mode, with 3 steering modes: comfort, normal and sport. With the comfort mode selected, it offered the greatest ease of steering designed for city driving and parking. The Sport mode was optimised for higher speed highways, while the normal mode was suitable for mixed driving conditions. Space-wise, the rear-cabin offered enough legroom, but headroom was on the tight side for taller adults. The cargo volume offered was good and could be extended by folding the rear seats. The rear seats were a bit uneasy to fold. Opting for the top of the range, the Elantra GT came equipped with features such as leather upholstery, a panoramic sunroof, 17-inch alloys, a sport tuned suspension and others.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Hyundai Elantra GT"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""compact hatchback"",  ""overall-design"": [""flowing lines"", ""sculpted angles"", ""aerodynamic"", ""modern"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""17-inch alloys""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""panoramic sunroof""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI Ioniq 5,"Ever since Hyundai unveiled the Ioniq 5 in March 2021, the world has been surprised by the car's dynamic capabilities and the crossover stance that helped it gain the hearts and the wallets of many customers. Moreover, it looked like a concept car, which was unusual, especially for the Korean automaker. But its ideas paid off, and the car sold in huge numbers. Moreover, its E-GMP platform shared with the Kia EV6 GT was a promise that the Ioniq could get a more powerful drivetrain setup. And that happened to the car in July 2023, when Hyundai unveiled the N version of the Ioniq 5 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. At first sight, it looked just like a regular Ioniq 5 with some stickers on it. And yet, there were major differences in the car's exterior. At the front, a grate-like grille ran across the front fascia from side to side. It was a metallic one since Hyundai didn't want to use cheap materials for its most potent electric vehicle. Still, the automaker kept the same pixel-style headlights from the regular Ioniq 5. But the lower bumper played in a different, higher league. The automaker enhanced the car in the wind tunnel and profiled the lower chin and splitter to make the car more planted to the road. On the sides, Hyundai added flared wheel arches that covered the wider and stickier Pirelli P-Zero tires. Furthermore, the side sills and the rear quarter panels underwent an enlargement process. As a result, the Ioniq 5 N looked sportier than its non-N sibling. Finally, at the back, the automaker placed a new bumper with an extended, integrated diffuser. Since the vehicle didn't feature any exhaust, that part was seamlessly integrated into the car's overall look. Inside, there was enough room for five adults to travel in comfort. Still, there were some noticeable differences compared to the regular Ioniq 5. The pedals and the dead pedal sported the same pixelated design as the exterior, with checker-flag-style on the pedals and the doors' sills. Unlike the Ioniq 5, the N version featured sports seats with high-bolstered areas, offering very good side support for their occupants during high cornering speeds. The E-GMP platform used for the Ioniq 5 and the Kia EV6 GT offered customers an all-wheel drive system with an available torque vectoring system for the rear axle. But Hyundai chose to do something else with the I5N version. It added a new 82 kWh battery under the floor, thus increasing the car's range. But the most surprising aspect of the Ioniq 5 N was under the skin, where the automaker installed a pair of motors that developed a combined power of 641 HP (650 PS), and both axles featured a torque-vectoring system, which was an improvement over the Ioniq 5 and the Kia EV6 GT.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ioniq 5"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""dynamic"", ""concept-like"", ""sporty"", ""planted"", ""seamless""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""metallic"", ""grate-like""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""pixel-style""],    ""bumper"": [""lower"", ""enhanced"", ""integrated"", ""extended""],    ""wheel"": [""flared"", ""wide"", ""sticky""],    ""doors"": [""pixelated"", ""checker-flag-style""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""integrated""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""none""]  }}```"
HYUNDAI i20 N,"Hyundai won the 2019 World Rally Championship with the i20 WRC, and it wants to share its success with its customers by offering a special market version: the i20 N. Hyundai returned to the WRC in 2014 and, in 2019, it won the Manufacturer's title with the i20 Coupe. But despite the glory, the customers were more interested in five-door versions rather than three-door ones. In 2020, Hyundai introduced the i20 N with five doors on the market. While the regular i20 couldn't be considered a bold car, the N version was a different breed. The designers took the bodywork to a different level by adding a new aerodynamic kit. The front bumper was lowered, and a black and red front lip was installed at the bottom. On the sides, there were a pair of fake air-intakes which host the fog lights. The exclusive 18"" light-alloy wheels were fitted as standard and unavailable for the rest of the i20 range. On top of the LED headlights, there was an interesting shaped daytime running light strip. In the back, a roof-spoiler made the car's look more aggressive, while at the bottom, there was a splitter under the bumper and a single, twin-pipe exhaust. Inside, the front bucket seats featured integrated headrests. The instrument cluster featured a configurable TFT display, where the driver could choose which dial to be shown bigger. An additional screen placed on top of the center stack was used for the infotainment system and to record performance data as well. Under the hood, the i20 N featured a 1.6-liter turbocharged gasoline engine that offered 204 hp. It was paired to a 6-speed manual gearbox. Power went to the front wheels via a limited-slip differential.

HYUNDAI Ioniq 6,"Hyundai made another step towards the electrification of its lineup when it introduced the Ioniq 6 in 2022, surprising the market with a streamlined vehicle. By 2022, Hyundai was no longer a new contender in the EV car market. The Korean giant carmaker already had a few vehicles on sale. Still, it lacked a competitor in the sedan segment, which came with a four-door coupe styling flavor but shared its underpinnings with the already known KIA EV6 and the Hyundai Ioniq5. At the front, the low nose and the sharp front fascia resembled the one featured on the Tesla Model 3, which was Ioniq 6's main competitor. The streamlined profile helped the car achieve an excellent 0.21 drag coefficient and showed a fluid line that ended on the sloped rear window. Unusually, the beltline followed a descending curve towards the car's end, resembling the shape of a Porsche 911 but with four doors. Even the back, with its ducktail and the additional spoiler placed at the bottom of the rear windscreen, resembled the same famous German sports car. Inside, Hyundai said that the interior was centered around humans but focused more on individual places instead. At the front, the driver sat in a separate area, with a long dual-screen layout on its side and separated by the side passenger by the angular-shaped, tall center console. At the back, the sloped roofline forced the carmaker to install lower seats to offer enough headroom for adult passengers.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ioniq 6"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""streamlined, low nose, sloped roofline"",  ""overall-design"": [""streamlined"", ""sharp front fascia"", ""fluid line"", ""sloped rear window"", ""descending curve""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""low""],    ""headlights"": [""sharp""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""four-door coupe styling""],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""ducktail"", ""additional""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI i30 Coupe,"Hyundai made an important step and introduced a three-door hatchback version for the i30 range in 2012, following the same idea introduced by its sister-brand Kia with the pro-cee'd. It was the third body version for the i30, after the hatchback and the station wagon. Hyundai tried to access the young customers with a coupe shape and compete against the well-known VW Golf 3-door or the Renault Megane Coupe. But it seemed like the Korean brand came too late to the party since other European carmakers already dropped their 3-door versions from their lineups. The three-door version of the i30 looked more aggressive than its five-door sibling. It featured new headlights and unique LED daytime running lights. It also sported a black mesh-grille instead of the body-colored one from the five-door version. The raked windshield was even more angled than on the regular hatchback, and the short cabin with its low roof made the car looks sportier. Hyundai added a roof-spoiler on top of the raked-forward tailgate. Inside, the i30 coupe featured sport bucket seats at the front and a 60/40 split-folding seatback for the rear bench. The carmaker installed an infotainment unit or a CD stereo on the center stack, depending on the trim level. Unlike its five-door sibling, the coupe offered an option for an opening panoramic glass-roof, similar to the one from the station wagon. Under the hood, Hyundai installed a wide engine choice with outputs between 90 hp and 135 hp, either gasoline or turbo-diesel. A six-speed manual was standard on the entire range, while a six-speed automatic was available for selected engines.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""i30"",  ""year"": ""2012"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""sporty"", ""youthful"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked"", ""angled""],    ""grille"": [""black mesh""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""new"", ""unique"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""three-door""],    ""roof"": [""low"", ""panoramic""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof-spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI Santa Cruz,"Hyundai broke new grounds when it introduced the Santa Cruz in its lineup and opened the gates for new, compact pickups. Unlike most pickups on the market, the Santa Crus was based on a unit-body construction, like the Honda Ridgeline, except that it was smaller. The Korean carmaker showed the concept vehicle in 2015 but waited another six years to unveil the production model. It was an innovative vehicle, and Hyundai called it a Sport Adventure Vehicle. Its front fascia was unique on the market. It featured a broad grille with dark-chromed elements. Between them, it installed a few LED daytime running lights, not only two like anyone else but four on each side! On the lower side of the bumper, on the outer areas, the carmaker installed the headlights. From its sides, the car revealed its half-SUV and half-pickup shape. Its four feet bed (1,220 mm) featured a smaller trunk under the floor, on the rear side. Inside, Hyundai stepped up the game and installed a fully digital dashboard, with a 10.2"" TFT screen in front of the driver and a standard eight-inch infotainment display on top of the center stack. A 10.2"" touch-screen was available on the options list. Underneath the infotainment display, the carmaker installed another touch-screen for the climate control unit. In their quest for a digital future, Hyundai's designers deleted the volume knobs. For seating, the carmaker installed a pair of bucket seats at the front and a folding bench in the back. The latter featured a lifting system, something like Honda's Magic Seats mechanism, which revealed a few storage areas for items that shouldn't be kept in the bed. For the Santa Cruz, Hyundai installed a four-pot engine, with or without a turbocharger. Both versions were paired to an eight-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox that sent the power in all corners.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Santa Cruz"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""innovative"", ""unique"", ""half-SUV"", ""half-pickup"", ""digital""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""dark-chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""outer""],    ""bumper"": [""lower side""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""pair of""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI Kona N,"The Kona is one of Hyundai's biggest hits on the market, and that made the Korean carmaker try a different approach with an ""N"" version for it in 2021. Hyundai was not reluctant to have high-power versions, and, before the internal combustion ban, it tried to get more attention to it with the N versions, which was its performance division that made possible the world rally cars and the race cars for track battles. The Kona was introduced as a small-segment crossover, aimed directly at those who needed an affordable, city-oriented vehicle. While most of its initial powertrains were mostly oriented towards fuel efficiency, the N was just exactly the opposite: it was the fierce one. Hyundai didn't hide the performance-oriented car with the same look shown on the rest of the Kona range. The front fascia featured the same body-colored bumper but with black grilles. Its side scoops sported a hexagonal mesh, unlike the rest of the Kona range that showed regular plastic panels and covers. At the bottom of the apron, the N version received a red stripe, emphasizing the car's sporty character. On the sides, through the big 19"" light-alloy wheels, the red brake calipers warned the bystanders that it was not an ordinary vehicle. That message was repeated in an even more obvious way by the enlarged rear wing mounted on the tailgate. Inside, the front seats featured a high-bolstered area on the sides and an embroidered N letter on the seatbacks. Even the rear seats received a special treatment and upholstery, with faux leather and Alcantara for the center sections. Under the hood, the N worked its magic and provided the vehicle with a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine that provided 280 hp. It paired the turbocharged inline-four mill with an eight-speed automatic transmission (wet dual-clutch gearbox) that sent the power to the front wheels via an Electronically-controlled Limited Slip Differential (e-LSD).",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Kona"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""small-segment crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""city-oriented"", ""sporty"", ""performance-oriented""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""body-colored"", ""red stripe""],    ""wheel"": [""19-inch light-alloy"", ""red brake calipers""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""enlarged rear wing""],    ""exhaust"": [],    ""interior"": [""high-bolstered front seats"", ""embroidered N letter"", ""faux leather and Alcantara rear seats""],    ""engine"": [""turbocharged 2.0-liter"", ""280 hp"", ""eight-speed automatic transmission"", ""Electronically-controlled Limited Slip Differential""]  }}```"
HYUNDAI Bayon,"While the Bayon might ring a bell only to the European customers, it doesn't mean anything for the rest of the world. Yet, Hyundai chose that nameplate for its 2021 crossover. Bayonne is a resort in France, and its pronunciation sounds just like the Hyundai's crossover. Considering that, it might seem that the Bayon was a recreational vehicle, not a daily driver one. Yet it was, and even though it fought on the same segment as the Hyundai Kona, it tried to address different customers and lure them away from other brands. The Bayon looked a lot bigger than the Kona, which didn't replace it, but it was similar-sized. Its front fascia sported the slim DRLs on the upper side of the bumper, well above headlights. A tall and wide trapezoidal grille covered most of the bumper, while a silver plastic trim mimicked a shield that protected the underbody. From its sides, it looked like a flame-surfacing concept, with various angles and panels sculptured to reflect light in all directions. Inside, there was roomy enough for four adults, thanks to its compact-sized wheelbase. The Bayon featured a flat floor in the back, which was a good point if there were five people on-board. At the front, the driver enjoyed the multiple displays installed. Its instrument cluster featured a digital 10.25"" display for all the information required for driving, while an 8"" touch-screen found its place on top of the center stack for the infotainment system. Under the hood, the Bayon featured a 1.0-liter turbocharged gasoline engine that provided up to 120 hp, combined with a mild-hybrid system. Hyundai offered the crossover with a five-speed manual, a six-speed manual, or a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) depending on the market and options.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Bayon"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""recreational"", ""flame-surfacing"", ""compact-sized"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""slim""],    ""grille"": [""trapezoidal"", ""wide""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""DRLs"", ""upper-positioned""],    ""bumper"": [""angled"", ""silver-trimmed""],    ""wheel"": [""compact-sized""],    ""doors"": [""roomy""],    ""roof"": [""flat""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""turbocharged""]  }}```"
HYUNDAI Mistra,"Placed between the Elantra and Sonata, the Hyundai Mistra was conceived as a premium-compact car for the Chinese market. It was launched in 2013 at the Shanghai Auto Show as a 2014 model year. On the outside, the Mistra was 4.7 m (15.4 ft) long, which is very close to the European Hyundai i40. Hyundai describes the Mistra's exterior design theme as ""grand"", consisting of ""modern simplicity, understated sportiness, and smart luxury"", and the Frost Jade paintwork apparently reflects the preference of Chinese customers. It is built on the same Hyundai-KiaY6 platform with the i40, but with fewer engine variants. To emphasize the premium look and feel, it was fitted with real wood and metal. Full leather seats and other luxury items were available, so the car could get a grip on the Chinese premium market. The 2.7 m (9 ft) long wheelbase made it a spacious sedan. Under the hood, Hyundai installed three gasoline engines with a displacement of 1.6 liters, 1.8 liters, and 2.0 lites, respectively. The power output ranged between 141 hp and 155 hp. It was available with a choice of transmissions consisting of a 6-speed manual and automatic, or a 7-speed double-clutch for the top-spec version. The performance of the top-spec version is reasonable, with a 195 kph (121 mph) top speed. The Mistra's suspension is an all-wheel independent type, well balanced for comfort.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Hyundai Mistra"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": ""4.7 m (15.4 ft) long"",  ""overall-design"": [""grand"", ""modern simplicity"", ""understated sportiness"", ""smart luxury"", ""Frost Jade paintwork""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""spacious sedan""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI Staria,"Hyundai made a bold step in the big MPV market with the introduction of the Staria, an up to 11 seat van created to offer comfortable rides for families or businesses purposes. The Korean carmaker experience on the minivan market was not very high since most of its vehicles from that segment were previously developed by other carmakers, such as Mitsubishi or Mercedes-Benz (for the H350). But times have changed, and Hyundai started to get a slice from the premium carmakers, and the 2022 Staria aimed directly at luxurious minivans or VIP shuttle busses. Its exterior looked like it was a concept car. Yet, it wasn't. Hyundai's design team came with the idea of a dropped window line that descended behind the A-pillars and continued all the way to the D-pillar. Its massive glass area as opposed to the carmakers' trend that created smaller windows. At the front, the big, grid-like lower bumper area suggested that Hyundai could add both hybrid and electric versions later on. Inside, Hyundai made room for up to 11 seats, but those arrangements will be available only in selected regions. In Europe, the regular driver's license allowed up to nine passengers, including the driver. For the nine-seat version, the Korean carmaker installed three rows with two seats and a bench for three in the back. The second row's seats could swivel 180 degrees. With a cab-forward design, the dashboard featured a minimalist design, with only a display for the instrument cluster and a touch-screen for the infotainment system to stand apart from the rest of the lines.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Staria"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""big MPV"",  ""overall-design"": [""bold"", ""luxurious"", ""concept-like"", ""massive glass area"", ""cab-forward design""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""dropped window line"", ""massive glass area""],    ""grille"": [""big"", ""grid-like""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""lower"", ""grid-like""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""swivel second row""],    ""roof"": [""cab-forward design""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI NEXO,"The second generation of the Hyundai Nexo was released in 2018 and was the vehicle to offer the best range of any hydrogen car by that time, 600 km. Basically, the way the Nexo worked was by combining hydrogen and oxygen, resulting in electricity and water. While the electricity got burned as fuel, the emission was represented by the water. The electricity powered the motors that turned the front wheels. The Nexo drove like a regular electric car and boasted 160 hp. Built on a completely new platform, the fuel tank had a capacity of 150 liters, thus the long range.  And while charging a regular electric vehicle might have taken some time, the Nexo could be refuelled in only 5 minutes. One of the downsides for 2018, the hydrogen fuel station were as available as necessary. The infrastructure was one of the biggest barrier in selling the Nexo. The Nexo had an impressive practicality, with enough room for 5 adults to sit comfortably. The cabin looked premium with high quality materials use throughout, while the modern large touchscreen media system and the big drive info display made it look futuristic. Top-notch safety systems were part of the package, such as lane keeping assist, blind spot monitoring - a more advanced feature that allowed showing live images with the traffic behind, images transmitted by the cameras mounted in the wing mirrors, rear cross traffic alert and numerous airbags. Equipped even with remote parking, the Nexo could park itself. Autonomous driving was possible up to 140 km/h and the Nexo even slowed down in the case of speed cameras were present along the way.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Hyundai Nexo"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""futuristic"", ""practical"", ""premium"", ""modern"", ""impressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""front-wheel drive""],    ""doors"": [""roomy""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
HYUNDAI Venue,"The Korean manufacturer showed the small Venue at the 2019 New York Auto Show and its look attracted a lot of good reviews. The small SUV wants to conquer that parking spot where you could never fit a compact sedan. And its design is kind of like a sporty version of the slightly larger Kona. Basically, the Hyundai Venue is a sub-compact on stilts. Sitting higher from the ground, with 15” or 16” wheels, it can gather together up to five people inside and some luggage in the trunk for a short trip. It might not be the perfect car for a long trip, but in and around the city it should do very well. Under the hood there is a 1.6-liter gasoline engine coupled with either a six-speed manual or an Intelligent Variable Transmission (IVT). The biggest surprises are coming from the safety features, where the little Venue gathers a big pack of amenities, from Front Collision Warning, to Driver Attention Warning, Lane Keep Assyst, Rear Collision-Cross Traffic Warning and Blind-Spot Collision Warning. For the infotainment system, Hyundai has put a lot of effort working to include Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in an 8-inch unit with touch screen controls.",HYUNDAI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Hyundai Venue"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""sub-compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""small"", ""attractive"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""modern""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""sleek""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""15-inch or 16-inch""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""high""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
INEOS Grenadier,"INEOS was born from a man's ambition to create a proper off-road machine capable of carrying the legacy of famous vehicles that, in the past, were used to conquer uncharted territories. Sir Jim Ratcliff came up with the idea of creating a 4x4 vehicle that could provide best-in-class off-road ability, durability, and utility. For that, he went to Land Rover to buy the assembly lines used for the former Defender, but he was turned down. Upset, he developed the Grenadier from scratch, purchased a former factory used by Mercedes-Benz to build the smart cars, and in early 2023 started the production for this rugged off-roader. The rugged exterior look of the vehicle resembled many other off-road vehicles with its flat panels and wedged shapes. Its front fascia featured round headlights and a grille that sported a pair of fog lamps. But, unlike most off-road vehicles on the market, the Grenadier also featured a designated location for a winch so that the car could be legally driven on public roads. From its profile, the boxy shape featured flat windows and a vertical drop at the back, where the automaker installed twin, side-hinged doors of unequal length. Inside, the Grenadier boasted a well-equipped cabin fitted with a 12.3"" touchscreen where the driver could read various information about off-road conditions, tilt angles, speed, and revs. One of the vehicle's unusual features was the five drain plugs that allowed the owner to clean the interior using a hose and to release the water on the ground. Yet, the car provided plenty of comfort and accessibility for five passengers. Under the skin, the Grenadier featured a ladder chassis and solid front and rear axles with coil suspensions. Both engines, one turbo-diesel and one turbocharged gasoline, were provided by BMW. They were paired to a ZF eight-speed automatic gearbox plus a two-speed transfer case.",INEOS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Grenadier"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""rugged off-roader"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""boxy"", ""flat panels"", ""wedged shapes"", ""well-equipped""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""flat""],    ""grille"": [""sporty"", ""round""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""round""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""side-hinged"", ""unequal length""],    ""roof"": [""flat""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
INFINITI QX60,"Infiniti broke its classic design language and entered into a new, uncharted map, with the 2022 QX60 revealed in June 2021. Infiniti teased the second generation of the QX60 in February 2022, and its customers awaited to see the final product. However, the SUV still relied on the same Nissan D platform used for the Pathfinder, which means that it wasn't just showing and no go. Yet, the vehicle's look was far more critical for the Infiniti customers than the approach or departure angle. At the front, the QX60 featured a new signature grille that suited the premium brand better than the previously used one. Its trapezoidal shape sported a rhomboidal mesh-grille with the brand's name engraved on the lower chromed slat. The LED headlights featured a three-part DRL mounted on their upper side, and their swept-back shape continued on the fenders. The carmaker installed tall and narrow scoops on the sides of the bumper, which created a more aggressive look for the seven-seat SUV. From its sides, the sculptured doors and rear quarter fenders were aerodynamically studied to lower the drag resistance, while at the back, the LED taillights mimicked the same shape as the headlights. Inside, depending on the trim level, the carmaker added up to seven seats. For the top trim level, the Autograph, the QX60 featured captain seats in the middle row and a removable center console. All seats featured a zero-gravity design inspired by NASA, and the front seats were heated and ventilated. For the dashboard, the carmaker offered an option for a 12.3 touch-screen placed above the center stack. Like any other SUV from its class, the QX60 had to provide a good cargo area. With the third row folded, it offered 1,177 liters (41.6 cu-ft) of trunk space. Under the hood, Infiniti placed its bets on a 3.5-liter V-6 engine paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission. In addition, the carmaker offered the QX60 with either front- or all-wheel-drive.",INFINITI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""QX60"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""midsize SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""aggressive"", ""aerodynamic"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""trapezoidal"", ""rhomboidal"", ""chromed"", ""signature""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""swept-back"", ""three-part DRL""],    ""bumper"": [""tall"", ""narrow"", ""aggressive""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
INFINITI QX80,"Infiniti refreshed the QX80 lineup in 2021 for the 2022 model year and brought slight exterior improvements and significant interior updates for its largest vehicle in the stable. The Japanese carmaker decided to bump its entire lineup, and the QX80 flagship received all the credits and improvements to stay on top of its game. Even though it wasn’t the most powerful in its class, it still offered plenty of features to be considered a tough contender. With a redesigned front fascia that featured the corporate grille with a chromed, surrounding rim, the QX80 provided a commanding view to the road. Its redesigned LED-enhanced headlights and the shining trim that adorned the lower side of the bumper offered the vehicle a premium look, in par with Audi, Mercedes-Benz, or Lexus, but more in the Cadillac and Lincoln styling. But it takes a keen eye to spot the differences between the 2018 and the 2022 model. Still, they exist and can be noticed on the lower grille, which features two slats instead of three. Inside, the most important upgrade was for the infotainment system. It seems like Infinity used the same Nissan infotainment system since the Nissan Primera P12, with a screen and many buttons arranged at its bottom area. The 2022 QX80 welcomed its customers with a wider and taller 12.3” touch-screen installed on top of the center stack and offered Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. Under the hood, Infinity placed the same 5.6-liter V8 engine paired to a seven-speed automatic transmission. It might not be the most fuel-efficient engine in its class, but it is appreciated for its smoothness and reliability.",INFINITI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""QX80"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""commanding"", ""premium"", ""reliable"", ""tough"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""corporate"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED-enhanced"", ""redesigned""],    ""bumper"": [""shining"", ""lower""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
INFINITI QX50,"Infiniti introduced the second generation of the QX series in 2016, and, in August 2020, the model was updated for the 2021 model year. While the first generation of the QX was more like a smaller brother of the big FX series, the second generation looked more like an alternative for the premium compact segment. Therefore, the crossover was improved in many areas regarding comfort and safety. The designers had to do some work as well. From the outside, the double-arch grille made the car looks bigger than it was. The lack of any gap between the grille and the hood made a clear statement about the product quality. The QX50 featured the Infiniti's signature LED headlights design with daytime running lights on the headlamps' edge. A subtle gap at the back of the hood, on the upper side of the fenders, let the hot air escape from the sides of the car, enhancing the cooling and the aerodynamic. Inside, there were more differences between the facelift and non-facelift versions. Apart from the base trim level, the Pure, all of the other versions featured panoramic glass-roof. The dashboard was asymmetric, with a focus on the driver. On the center stack, there were two touch-screen displays installed. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration were standard on the entire range. For the sound system, Bose equipment was offered as an option. The engine was the first variable-compression turbocharged gasoline unit. It offered a compression ratio between 8:1 and 14:1 depending on driver needs for power or fuel-efficiency.",INFINITI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""QX50"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""asymmetric"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""efficient""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""double-arch"", ""bigger"", ""seamless""],    ""hood"": [""subtle gap"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""daytime running"", ""signature""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""panoramic glass""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
INFINITI Q70,"It seems that the main focus of Infiniti was to create luxurious cars, regardless of the class. The Q70 went 5 years without any upgrades and for 2018, Infiniti decided to take a step forward and redesign their luxury sedan. The exterior design of the Q70 was all about elegance and functionality with its aerodynamic body shape. And the same applied to the luxurious interior. The cabin offered generous room for both the front and the rear passengers. An elevated center console along with the wraparound dashboard gave the driver the feeling of driving a sports car. The seats were very comfortable and highly adjustable. The overall quality of the materials used inside the Q70 was high, with leather and metal-finish accents all around. Two trim levels were available with the Q7, the 3.7 Luxe and the 5.6 Luxe. Of course, the numbers indicated the engine mounted on each trim level. Additionally, a long-wheelbase model and a hybrid version were available. Both trim levels came with a rear-wheel-drive system and an optional all-wheel-drive, with the exception of the hybrid. The 3.7-liter V6 engine developed 330 hp and came with a sunroof, a dual-zone automatic climate control, heated front seats and an optional no-cost Essential package. The 5.6 Luxe powered by the 5.6-liter V8 engine that developed 420 hp included the features offered for the 3.7 Luxe and added heated steering wheel, parking sensors, leather upholstery, an 8-inch touchscreen display and a premium Bose 10-speaker audio system.

INFINITI Q50,"In a market crowded with small luxury sedans, there were many reasons why a customer would choose the Infiniti Q50. And to make it more simple, the distinctive sharp design was one of the vehicle’s strongest points. With such a beautifully designed exterior came a soft sporty interior fitted with quality materials all around. The center console consisted of two screens, one to display the navigation and the images from the 360 degree camera and the other one to offer easy access to the infotainment system. Unusual for a 2018, the Q50 did not have smartphone integration (AppleCar Play or Android auto) - a feature that most vehicles in the luxury sedan class offered in 2018. While the passengers in the front seats would seat comfortably, the rear seats were not suitable for tall adults due to limited legroom and headroom. The new Q50 kept the direct adaptive steering system, thus there were no mechanical connections between the steering wheel and the wheels. Some might have considered that with this system the steering was not as precise. The sportiest along the trim levels was the special Red Sport 400 edition that featured a 3.-liter turbocharged V6 engine, a ferociously quick unit. Every trim level was equipped with a standard 7-speed automatic transmission. The starting price of this model was around $52,000. For those considering the Red Sport 400 was too expensive, the Luxe trim level was equipped with a 3.0-liter V6. A hybrid version was also available, with a 3.5-liter V6, an electric motor and lithium ion batteries. This version offered great fuel economy and was well loaded, however, its price was around $51,000.",INFINITI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Infiniti Q50"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""small luxury sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""distinctive"", ""sharp"", ""sporty"", ""beautiful"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""distinctive""],    ""hood"": [""sharp""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sporty""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
INFINITI Q60,"Infiniti introduced the Q60 Coupe in 2018 as a replacement for its aging G-series coupe and shared its underpinnings with the Q50 Sedan. When Infiniti unveiled the Q60 concept car at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show, there were few to believe that the Japanese premium automaker would actually build the vehicle in the same shape. Usually, concept cars are just show-offs but nothing more. However, for Infiniti, that was a moment of truth, and the end result was an almost identical vehicle. Moreover, the small changes it made to the original concept car looked even better on the production model. With its low stance, long hood, and arched greenhouse, the Q60 looked just like it should for a personal luxury coupe vehicle. Its curved, arched lines and sharp angles made the car look like a custom build. At the front, the thick chromed rim surrounding the grille offered an upmarket image. Moreover, the sharp, human-eye-looking headlights fitted with LED and smart lighting technology enhanced the car's appearance and ensured a better night-driving experience. From its profile, the Q60 Coupe revealed an intriguing window line that formed a Z-shaped bump at the back. A reminder of the old, glorious Z-cars from Nissan. Inside, the front seats were comfortable, with adjustable side bolsters. The aluminum trims that looked like silver carbon-fiber patterns successfully combined the sporty and elegant appearance. On the center stack, the carmaker installed a new generation of the infotainment system, with touch-screen control instead of the older, button-based unit. But despite the modern-looking features, it still relied on a foot-activated parking brake. The rear seats provided just enough headroom for shorter passengers but enough legroom. Under the hood, Infiniti installed a choice of Mercedes-Benz-sourced inline-four, turbocharged engines and its own twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 powerplant. Power went to the rear wheels via a seven-speed automatic gearbox supplied by the German carmaker.",INFINITI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Q60 Coupe"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""low stance, long hood"",  ""overall-design"": [""curved"", ""arched"", ""sharp angles"", ""upmarket"", ""intriguing window line""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""thick chromed rim""],    ""hood"": [""long""],    ""headlights"": [""sharp"", ""LED"", ""smart lighting technology""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
INFINITI QX30,"A beautiful mix of a coupe, hatchback and crossover, the QX30 impressed with its distinctive design. While it’s not only about the looks, the QX30 nicely blended the versatility of an SUV with an increased cargo capacity, as well as impressive handling that was more specific to a hatchback, even with the taller ride height. A luxurious compact would better define the QX30 that was available in four trim levels: base, Luxury, Premium and Sport. The base trim level was really well equipped with great safety and comfort features, thus the buyers would have needed to look for the upper trim levels if they were interested in leather upholstery, heated front seats, a rear seat armrest and driver memory settings (coming with the Luxury trim level). The Premium trim level offered roof rails, LED foglights and an upgraded 10-speaker Bose sound system. Moving forward to the Sport trim level, the QX30 came with unique features such as a tweaked suspension and implicitly a lower stance, 19-inch alloys, front and rear parking sensors, specific black side mirrors, as well as rear lowers fascias, a black grille, front sport seats, an automated parking system and a premium Bose audio system. While the Sport trim level was only available with a front-wheel-drive system, while the other trim levels could have been both four-wheel-drive or front-wheel-drive. The 2017 model was powered by a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine that generated 208 hp and 258 pound-feet of torque, mated with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.",INFINITI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""QX30"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""distinctive"", ""luxurious"", ""versatile"", ""impressive"", ""unique""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""19-inch alloys""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""roof rails""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
INFINITI QX70,"Infiniti introduced a facelifted version for the QX70 lineup in 2017, improving the SUV with a more aggressive look, and also offered a newly introduced Limited Package. The premium SUV segment was highly competitive. All premium carmakers had something to offer here, and that led to a tight race between the brands involved. As one of the three Japanese premium brands, Infiniti couldn't stay aside and closed the gap between the QX70 and its competitors when it refreshed it four years after the model introduction. At the front, the 2017 QX70 sported new, standard, bi-functional xenon headlights that flanked a redesigned grille with a chromed surrounding and black mesh. Under the bumper, a silver shield gave the impression of a true off-road vehicle, even though the QX70 was far from that. The vents installed on the front fenders featured a body-color trim on the sides, and most importantly, they were not fake. Instead, they were used to extract the air trapped inside the wheel wells, thus reducing the aerodynamic lift. Last but not least, the car received a set of 21"" light alloy wheels. Inside, the carmaker installed a 10-way power-adjustable driver's seat, with 8-way for the side passenger. Even though Infiniti claimed that the car could take five occupants inside in comfort, four was more feasible, while the trunk was designed to carry four golf bags. The platform was kept, and the 3.7-liter VVEL powerplant was good for 325 horsepower. It was mated to a seven-speed automatic gearbox that sent the power to the rear axle or in all corners.",INFINITI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""QX70"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""premium"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""redesigned"", ""chromed"", ""black""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""bi-functional"", ""xenon""],    ""bumper"": [""silver"", ""off-road""],    ""wheel"": [""21-inch"", ""light alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
INFINITI QX55,"Nissan's premium brand introduced an updated version for the QX55 SUV in late 2020, for the 2021 model. When Infiniti unveiled the FX in 2002, there was no other SUV coupe on the market. Its roofline was inspired by the Nissan Z-series (or the Infiniti G35). Later on, BMW introduced the X6, Mercedes-Benz came with the GLC, and Audi presented the Q8. Infiniti wasn't didn't rush things and let them evolved slowly, like a slow-cooked food. In 2020 the Japanese brand introduced the QX55 as an SUV-coupe on the compact-segment. The QX series was developed together with Mercedes-Benz, and it shared the platform with the GLB model. It took a different approach for design and showed a face with a massive grille at the front and a chromed surrounding. Its narrow LED headlights with daytime running lights at the top inspired some sumo-fighter eyes. From its sides, the sloped roofline, and coupe-like windows shape, the QX55 inspired more performance than any other Infiniti SUV to date. The interior was even more surprising for a high-tech premium vehicle introduced in 2020. It had a regular instrument cluster with analog dials and a TFT display between them for the on-board computer. Two large screens on the center stack were used for the infotainment system and other car settings. In the front, there were two bucket seats and a bench in the back for three adults. Though, the middle one's legroom was obstructed by the center console with vents. Under the hood, Infiniti installed its much-acclaimed 2.0-liter turbocharged engine with a variable compression system, which sent the power in all corners via a CVT.",INFINITI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""QX55"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""sloped"", ""coupe-like"", ""high-tech"", ""massive grille""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""narrow""],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""narrow"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""coupe-like""],    ""roof"": [""sloped"", ""inspired by Z-series""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""turbocharged""]  }}```"
ISUZU Rodeo / D-Max,"Engineered for the most difficult terrains in the world, the Isuzu D-Max (Rodeo) Arctic Truck AT35 was a technical showcase about the possibilities of the well-known Japanese pickup. The D-Max was considered a true workhorse, with some comfort features for its occupants. The trustworthy 2.5-liter turbodiesel engine was one of the most fuel-efficient powerplants in its class and that was no wonder since Isuzu is the biggest diesel-engine manufacturer in the world. Arctic Trucks was an international company based in Iceland specialized in re-engineering four-wheel-drive vehicles for harsh terrain. It used to modify the Toyota HiLux for the Arctic expeditions and it teamed-up with Isuzu in developing the D-Max. The general shape of the body was kept, but the overfenders and big bumpers were from the Icelandic specialists. The car was fitted with 35” tires on 10x17” alloy wheels. The car featured an onboard inflation kit, which allowed the inflation or deflation of the tires. To make room for the massive wheels, FOX suspension installed new coils and dampers for both axles. The D-Max Arctic Truck was available as a single or double-cab, but with the same wheelbase. The chassis was reinforced with additional braces for more torsional rigidity. The front independent suspension and the rear axle helped the driver maintain full control of the vehicle on slopes or bumpy terrain. Under the hood, there was the same 2.5-liter turbodiesel as the standard D-Max. It was mated to either a 6-speed manual or to an optional 5-speed automatic with sequential control. Due to intensive modifications, the D-Max Arctic Truck AT35 didn't feature a hill descent control, but the engine braking combined with a low-range gear and big tires made that system irrelevant.",ISUZU,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Isuzu D-Max (Rodeo) Arctic Truck AT35"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""big"",  ""overall-design"": [""technical showcase"", ""trustworthy workhorse"", ""massive wheels"", ""reinforced chassis""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""big""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""big""],    ""wheel"": [""10x17” alloy""],    ""doors"": [""single or double-cab""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
JAGUAR F-Pace SVR,"Jaguar-Land Rover didn't have too many engines to adapt them for different vehicles. But when they had a great, supercharged V8, they put it on almost every car they had. Jaguar enhanced the F-Type with a new 550 hp engine and gave it access to the SVR club. SVR was the Special Vehicle Racing department, which was like an in-house tuner for the British brand. The engineers from that lab were responsible for producing several performance vehicles for both brands. But there was more than just a big engine under a hood. The F-Type SVR was a supercar dressed in Luxury SUV clothes, but it couldn't hide its high-performance capabilities. There was a new lower apron on the front fascia with a bigger and wider grille and side-scoops. Most of them were functional and contributed to the engine and brake cooling. The new aerodynamic package lowered the drag-resistance coefficient from 0.37 to 0.36. Inside, Jaguar installed a luxurious yet sporty interior. Seat and door inserts were finished in Alcantara, with center stack and console wrapped in Windsor leather. A 12.3"" interactive driver display was placed in the Alcantara wrapped instrument cluster. Jaguar designers modified the look of the drive selector and transformed it into a small, wide handle to select the driving programs. Under the hood, the supercharged engine sent the power in all corners via an eight-speed automatic transmission. To help the car cope better with various terrains, the rotary knob of the JaguarDrive Control changed the drivetrain settings for Comfort, Eco, Rain-Ice-Snow, and Dynamic modes.",JAGUAR,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""F-Type SVR"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""high-performance"", ""aerodynamic"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""bigger"", ""wider""],    ""hood"": [""new lower apron""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""functional"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""luxurious"", ""sporty""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""supercharged""]  }}```"
JAGUAR F-Type Coupe,"The proportions of Jaguar are timeless and instantly recognisable, but the new F-Type looks even better. Evolved from its predecessor's World Car Design-winning form, the breathtaking looks of the new Jaguar F-Type are enhanced by the super-slim Pixel LED headlights which enhance the car's qualities. Whichever model customers choose, whether is the F-Type, F-type R-Dynamic or F-Type R, one thing is sure, Jaguar maintains its assertiveness with Jaguar's Signature J daytime running lights that features a calligraphy graphic: slim along the horizontal element of the light guide, and then widening as it sweeps upwards – as if a stroke from an art brush. Running along the J is an exquisitely-detailed monogram pattern, inspired by Jaguar's heritage logo. The light graphic accentuates the car's visual width and hints at its peak performance potential. Also, a subtly enlarged grille accentuates the new Jaguar F-Type's visual presence. Jaguar F-Type Coupe can be customised even more by choosing one of the 16 paints in the SVO Premium Palette. The fans will definitely notice inside the cabin a mondaine look with luxurious materials such as Sienna Tan Windsor Leather, Suedecloth, Alcantara, and satin-finish Noble Chrome. Lightweight slimline seats combine an ergonomically optimised form with outstanding comfort, further upgraded by heating and cooling options.",JAGUAR,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Jaguar F-Type"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""timeless proportions"", ""breathtaking looks"", ""assertive"", ""visual width"", ""luxurious cabin""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""subtly enlarged""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""super-slim Pixel LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
JAGUAR F-Pace,"With the plug-in hybrid version of the F-Pace, Jaguar offered a good option for a luxurious, compact-sized, SUV for the market. It offered good performances as well. When most of the car-makers started to switch their attention toward the increasing SUV market, Jaguar just had to ask its sister-company Land Rover to help them. The result was the 2016 Jaguar F-Pace built on the same platform with the Range Rover Velar. In 2020, the British brand introduced a plug-in hybrid version, which proved to be an interesting vehicle with a fair electric range for the urban daily commute and a powerful drivetrain useful for long-distance trips. The 2020 F-Pace featured a restyled front end, with a smoother hood and LED headlights. There was an option for pixel-LED, which analyzed and adapted the lights if any oncoming traffic appeared. For the plug-in hybrid version, it featured fewer air-vents in the front. The big bumper featured three air-intakes, to complement the radiator grille and cool the brakes. In the rear, the same slim taillights as before were slightly redesigned and featured LED as well. The interior was luxurious, with the Jaguar standards. The instrument cluster featured a centrally-mounted tachometer with the speedometer in the middle, on a TFT display, with two other screens on the left and right of it. On the center stack, there was a completely new infotainment system, with an 11.4” curved-glass HD touchscreen. On the center console, there was a gear-selector with a lever, instead of the already known rotary knob. Under the hood, the F-Type offered a choice of gasoline, diesel, and hybrid engines ranged between 250 hp and 404 hp. The latter was offered as a plug-in hybrid as well.",JAGUAR,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""F-Pace"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""sleek"", ""powerful"", ""smooth"", ""restyled""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sleek""],    ""grille"": [""radiator"", ""front""],    ""hood"": [""smoother""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""pixel-LED"", ""adaptive""],    ""bumper"": [""big"", ""three air-intakes""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""plug-in hybrid""]  }}```"
JAGUAR F-Type Convertible,"After seven years on the market, Jaguar decided in December 2019 to show the facelifted version of its smallest coupe: the F-Type. It is offered as a coupe and also as a convertible. And if its first feature would be to look beautiful, the Brits have succeeded to do it. The revamped Jaguar F-Type has kept the long hood, but slightly modified to be sleeker than before. A wider front grille helps cool the engine better. Maybe when the first F-Type was tested in the UK they had only rainy weather available. But since climate changes, they had to redo this and now the engine will have more air for cooling and breathing. J-style signatures lamps with DRLs are a striking presence on the road. Headlights are also LED only. On the inside, things are more 2020, mainly thanks to a new 12.3 screen instrument cluster. On the center console, a new infotainment system with another touch-screen is present. All the driver needs to do is connect the phone to the infotainment system, either Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, and a new world of functions are going to be available. With the top down, under shining sun, it will be hard to read it, though. But who cares if you have one of the best sounds V6 engines under the hood and a comfortable automatic gearbox? After all, the F-Type convertible is not about aggressive driving, but about relaxed driving under the open sky.",JAGUAR,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""F-Type"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""beautiful"", ""sleek"", ""striking"", ""2020"", ""comfortable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wider""],    ""hood"": [""long""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""striking""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
JAGUAR F-Type SVR Coupe,"Jaguar evolved under the Indian management and developed new products that brought the British brand back to the spotlights. The F-Type took Jaguar where it ended the E-Type chapter and the result was stunning. It was a complete package of beauty, performance, and elegance. Its lines were not Italians, its engine was not German and its management was not concerned to install the same buttons and horns from other mass-market production vehicles. Then, when the customers acknowledged the success, it came with a fierce coupe. No more talking! That's what the face of the F-Type SVR seemed to tell to the audience. A big, black grille with a horizontal bar (mandatory for the license plate) and a few other air-scoops to cool the brakes or channel the air formed the top-performer front fascia. A pair of vents on the hood resembled those installed in the past on the V12 engined Jaguars. At the back, a retractable wing ensured a zero-lift aerodynamic effect for the car. The interior must have been crafted with a keen eye for detail. The quilted leather seats, the sound system, and the dashboard featured a unique, Jaguar style. Its sport-bucket seats hugged the occupants and denied them any lateral movement in the corners. The most important part was the technical layout. Under the hood stood a supercharged 5.0-liter V8 that could propel the car up to 200 mph (322 kph). You don't have to be a genius to realize that the 575 hp engine could take the light coupe even further. Still, Jaguar denied any production vehicle to overtake the legendary Jaguar XJ220 supercar. Last but not least, the F-Type SVR was all-wheel-drive.",JAGUAR,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""F-Type SVR"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""light coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""beautiful"", ""elegant"", ""stunning"", ""unique"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""big"", ""black"", ""horizontal"", ""top-performer""],    ""hood"": [""vented"", ""resembling V12 engined Jaguars""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""retractable"", ""zero-lift aerodynamic""],    ""exhaust"": [""supercharged"", ""powerful"", ""5.0-liter V8"", ""575 hp"", ""all-wheel-drive""]  }}```"
JAGUAR XF Sportbrake,"Even though Jaguar was known for creating luxury vehicles, the British carmaker didn't step back from offering some interesting station-wagons, such as the 2020 XF Sportbrake. The XF was designed and launched at the end of the Ford period, and it was based on the same platform as the S-Type. But that was more than 12 years before the introduction of the 2020 XF range and, moreover, the station-wagon version. A version which was named Sportbrake. While the Shooting-brake was a name given for the station-wagons built upon a 2-door version of a car, the Sportbrake was intended to be the station-wagon of a 4-door coupe vehicle. Unlike other carmakers, Jaguar didn't want to say that its two-box vehicle was a shooting-brake. It kept the same front fascia, but from the A-pillars behind, everything was different. The longer roof-line, the raked D-pillars, and the tailgate confirmed a more practical version of a luxury 4-door coupe. The new interior was noticeable, mostly due to its new technology. The manufacturer installed an 11.4"" curved-glass HD touch-screen on the dashboard in an elegant magnesium alloy casing. It controlled the new Pivi Pro infotainment system. For the seats, the 2020 XF Sportbrake was available with wider seats and with massage function. Under the hood, the car was enhanced to comply with the Euro 6D norms. The diesel engine was fitted with a starter-generator system that helped the vehicle achieve better fuel efficiency and lower the CO2 emissions. For the gasoline versions, the XF Sportbrake was offered with two versions of the 2.0-liter unit that delivered 250 hp and 300 hp, respectively.",JAGUAR,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""XF Sportbrake"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""station-wagon"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxury"", ""practical"", ""elegant"", ""enhanced"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""front""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""4-door""],    ""roof"": [""longer"", ""raked""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
JAGUAR XE,"Four years after being introduced as the first Jaguar to sport the XE moniker, the entry level sedan has received a mid cycle facelift that features a revamped design, a more luxurious cabin and a ton of technology features that improve the model on every level. With some of the new design motifs being inspired by the F-Type sports car, the facelifted Jaguar XE appears wider and lower than before, with larger front apertures, bold graphics and muscular forms eluding to the car's increased performance and improved aerodynamics. The front end features a redesigned bumper and new LED headlights with a more aggressive 'J' blade daytime running light signature. The XE's rear also features a new design for the bumper and slimmer full LED tail lights that have an updated signature graphics. All the design modifications enforce the visual width of the car, giving the XE a more planted appearance. The redesigned interior features extensive use of soft-touch materials, premium veneers and all-new door trims that improve usability and practicality as much as they look good. Shared with the F-Type, the JaguarDrive Control Switch and SportShift gear selector for automatic models give the car a more high-tech feel, while the new steering wheel, shared with the all-electric I-PACE, features hidden-until-lit graphics and tactile switches for intuitive control of key functions.",JAGUAR,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Jaguar XE"",  ""year"": ""mid cycle facelift"",  ""size"": ""wider, lower"",  ""overall-design"": [""revamped"", ""luxurious"", ""muscular"", ""aggressive"", ""planted""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""larger front apertures"", ""bold graphics""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""new LED headlights"", ""aggressive 'J' blade daytime running light signature""],    ""bumper"": [""redesigned"", ""increased performance""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""all-new door trims"", ""improved usability""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
JAGUAR XJR,"The Jaguar XJ575 was not the smoothest car to be chauffeured in, but it was way more subtle than an S-Class AMG or an Audi S8. Jaguar introduced the 575 version for the XJ in 2017 as a 2018 model year, and it was more than just the regular limo that could take the owner from A to B. Depending on the customers"" options, the car could have been looked subtle or not, but regardless of that, it was fast. Very fast, actually! Unlike the rest of the XJ range, the XJR575 featured a different bumper with a lower apron and a big, black-mesh grille. The Jaguar badge was red as a reminder that it was not just a regular version. Regardless of thecar'ss color, the vents on the hood betrayed thecar'ss supercharged engine under the hood. For the headlights, the British carmaker its J-signature LED daytime running lights. Inside, the car featured a different interior than the rest of the XJ range. It was still luxurious, but the high-bolstered front bucket seats sported a diamond-quilted leather upholstery. There were plenty of 575 red badges in the car to remind the occupants what the car was. A 1"" touch-screen monitor was placed on the center stack and controlled various car functions, including the climate controls, the navigation, or the sound system. In the long-wheelbase version, the XJ575 offered more than one meter (3 ft) of legroom. The five-liter supercharged engine produced 575 hp, and Jaguar paired it with an eight-speed automatic gearbox. It sent all the power to the rear wheels. Thanks to that setup, the car could rocket from zero to 60 mph (0-97 kph) in 4.2 seconds. Unlike most German fast premium sedans, it could go up to 186 mph (299 kph).",JAGUAR,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Jaguar XJ575"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""long-wheelbase"",  ""overall-design"": [""subtle"", ""fast"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""big"", ""black-mesh""],    ""hood"": [""vented""],    ""headlights"": [""J-signature LED""],    ""bumper"": [""different"", ""lower apron""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
JAGUAR XF,"It is already well known that even from the beginnings, Jaguar was all about creating big luxury sedans. The brand did not disappoint with its XF released for 2020 and presented an even more appealing car, both the interior and the exterior being redesigned. The front was enhanced with the new all-LED headlights that had the „Double J” signature. The headlights didn’t only look good, but were highly efficient with the Adaptive Driving Beam, a system that could analyze the road and adapt the high beam to the traffic conditions. The front bumper and the grille were redesigned for a more dynamic look. The rear was fitted with a wider bumper and darkened rear lights. While the exterior designed convinced us, the 2020 XF was also comfortable and practical, The huge opening of the trunk revealed impressive space for luggages. The vehicle was equipped with parking sensors all long the back and for a more pleasant experience, users could choose a top-roof mounted camera that offered high visibility in the back, even if the car was full of passengers. While looking inside the XF, we noticed the beautiful black stitchings along with the soft touch materials used for the details. From the driver’s perspective, the XF offered a pleasant view, with the nicely designed clusters and the infotainment system. The infotainment system offered more than the already standard media streaming or simply connecting the phone. Both the driver and the passenger could start the seats heating with a touch. For 2020, the XF was a good competitor to the BMW 5 Series and the Mercedes’ E-Class.

JAGUAR E-Pace,"In 2017 Jaguar introduced the E-Pace crossover as a smaller sibling to the F-Pace and shared its underpinnings with the Land Rover Range Rover Evoque. While at first sight, it didn't look like a good idea for Jaguar to offer an SUV or a crossover in its lineup, sales proved that misconception wrong. Sure, the brand's hard-core fans didn't want to look at it, but new customers stormed Jaguar's showrooms. Finally, the British brand had a car to compete against its main German rivals, the Q3 from Audi, the X1 from BMW, and the GLA from Mercedes-Benz. Even though it was based on the same platform as other Land Rover products, the car's exterior, brilliantly designed by Ian Callum, didn't show that. Moreover, the E-Pace's lines resembled those from the F-Type coupe with the swept-back, organic-shaped headlights that flanked the main broad grille. Lower, on the bumper, Jaguar added a pair of side scoops and a second grille in the apron. From its profile, the E-Pace revealed a coupe-like shaped greenhouse with a raked-forward tailgate at the back adorned by a roof spoiler. Furthermore, the taillights resembled those from the F-Type. Inside, the car's luxurious cabin boasted a pair of bolstered front seats at the front and a bench seat out back. In addition, the center stack housed the infotainment touchscreen, while the driver fronted a binnacle with large dials for the speedometer and tachometer in individual clusters that flanked an LCD between them. On the center stack, the automaker placed the touchscreen for the infotainment system, which unfortunately didn't feature Android Auto or Apple CarPlay. Under the hood, Jaguar installed a range of inline-four engines, either gasoline or diesel depending on the market. All of them were turbocharged, and most versions were fitted with an all-wheel drive system.",JAGUAR,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""E-Pace"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""compact crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""sporty"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""swept-back""],    ""grille"": [""broad""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""organic-shaped"", ""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [""adorned with side scoops"", ""with a second grille""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""luxurious""],    ""roof"": [""coupe-like"", ""adorned by a roof spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": [""fitted with""],  }}```"
JAGUAR I-Pace,"The compact SUV Jaguar I-Pace launched was launched in 2018 with the promise of a decent range and very good performance for its car segment. Jaguar announced its electric revolution with the CX-75 concept in 2010, which was a hybrid. But its design cues and style were used for the following electric models of the British brand. In March 2019 it won the ""European Car of The Year"" award and, a month later, became the 2019 ""World Car of The Year"". It was the first Jaguar to get these prizes. The designer of the I-Pace was Ian Callum, who gave the car a bold appearance. Even though it wasn't a sports car or a sedan, the wide shoulders on the rear fenders and the trapezoidal mesh-grille upfront were signatures for the Jaguar brand. The low drag coefficient of just 0.29 was unusually low for an SUV, but it was necessary to achieve an up to 480 km (298 miles) range according to the WLTP system. Inside, a digital revolution welcomed its passengers with a complete package. A new, state-of-the-art Touch Pro Duo ""Flight deck"" infotainment system combined with the distinctive floating center console, made the vehicle design unique in its segment. The instrument cluster was also digital. An unusual long wheelbase for the vehicle's length of 2990 mm (157"") allowed up to an impressive 890 mm (35"") legroom and, despite the low vehicle profile and swept roof-line, it offered 968 mm (38.1"") of headroom. The rear luggage compartment capacity of 656 liters (23.2 cu-ft) was expandable up to 1453 liters (51.3 cu-ft). The all-wheel-drive SUV had two electric motors, with a combined power of 400 hp. It was offered with an optional pneumatic suspension.",JAGUAR,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Jaguar I-Pace"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""compact SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""bold"", ""distinctive"", ""digital"", ""long wheelbase"", ""swept roof-line""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""trapezoidal mesh""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""wide shoulders on rear fenders""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""swept""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
JAGUAR XE SV,"Only 300 units of the four-door saloon with racing performance were built from this special manufactured Jaguar. It was truly a race-car with license plates. Some car-manufacturers have a special department, team or crew of engineers who are preparing cars for racing. Jaguar has the SVO or Special Vehicle Operations. There, the engineers hand-built the most performant cars of the luxury British brand. Project 8 was based on the mid-size sedan, XE. The vehicle featured the most highly tuned version of Jaguar Land Rover's 5.0-liter Supercharged V8 gasoline engine that offered 600 hp. The engine was mated to an 8-speed automatic gearbox and an all-wheel-drive transmission. The bodywork was equipped with motorsport-derived aerodynamics. Altogether with low weight, and the result was a 0-60 mph (0-97 kph) in 3.3 seconds. It was the fastest accelerating Jaguar to that time. The interior was striped-down to bare essentials. Even the rear seats were optional, but the standard it had two carbon-fiber racing seats and four-point harnesses. The instrument cluster featured a 12.3"" TFT display with full-screen 3D map view navigation, a 200 mph-plus (over 335 kph) and a track mode interface. The infotainment unit featured Dynamic-i with a stopwatch, g-meter, and other track-use information. Since it had a dual-view technology, it allowed the passenger and driver to view different content on the central screen simultaneously. Giving the driver all the required information on speed, revs and dynamic performance, whether on-road or track, Project 8 features the latest Virtual 12.3-inch TFT Instrument Panel Display with full-screen 3D Map View navigation, a 200mph-plus speedometer and Track Mode interface directly behind the steering wheel.",JAGUAR,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Jaguar XE Project 8"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""mid-size sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""racing"", ""luxury"", ""high-performance"", ""aerodynamic"", ""stripped-down""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""low-weight""],    ""headlights"": [""motorsport-derived""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""carbon-fiber""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""exhaust"": [""high-performance""]  }}```"
JEEP Wrangler,"Based on the same sturdy chassis of the Wrangler JL, the 2024 Willys version was a nice surprise for the American automaker, which also came with a locking differential for the rear axle. Jeep never abandoned its heritage and also bragged about its connection with the Willys. This sturdy 4x4 car helped the Allies win WWII. Over the years, even the styling of the Wrangler lineup resembled that vehicle, and apart from one generation, all others featured round headlights, for instance. In 2023, at the Easter Jeep Safari and at the NYIAS, the carmaker introduced the 2024 model year of the Wrangler Willys. Like the rest of the Wrangler range, the Willys featured the new, smaller grille, which was integrated into the body-colored front panel. On the sides, the round headlights were pushed furthermore inside the bodywork and thus were protected by branches, bushes, and other off-road-specific obstacles. On its sides, the 33"" tires were new. The interior was heavily upgraded with a new 12"" landscape-mounted touchscreen for the infotainment system. This Connect 5 unit replaced the former 8"" one and also featured Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The drivetrain was also improved with a Tru-Lok rear locking differential that was highly demanded by customers. In addition, the 4xe powertrain version came with the Selec-Trac full-time transfer case that added a low-range 2.71:1 ratio.",JEEP,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Wrangler Willys"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""smaller"",  ""overall-design"": [""sturdy"", ""heritage-inspired"", ""off-road-specific"", ""upgraded"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""smaller"", ""integrated"", ""body-colored""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""round"", ""pushed inside"", ""protected""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""33-inch""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
JEEP Gladiator,"Jeep refreshed the Gladiator lineup for the 2024 model year and improved not just the car's interior but also its off-road capabilities. In addition, it refined the look of this off-road-oriented pickup. Jeep made the first generation of the Gladiator between 1962 and 1988 with regular updates and improvements and waited until 2019 to revive the nameplate. Meanwhile, it tried to fill the gap with the Comanche range, but that one lasted only a short time. As a result, between 1992 and 2019, there was no truck in the Jeep's stable. When the automaker finally decided to offer customers a go-anywhere, carry-anything vehicle, it built it on the same ladder chassis used by the Wrangler TJ, and that was an intelligent decision. But after four years on the market, the car needed an update. Customers wanted something more from their utility vehicles. While the exterior design was not improved significantly, there were still some aesthetic updates to make it look fresh. The most significant update was on the seven-slat grille. It featured a new look with black textured slots, neutral gray metallic bezels, and body-color surroundings. In addition, the aerial antenna for the radio was deleted and integrated into the windshield. As a result, there was no more bending and breaking the mast-type metallic one while off-roading. The 2024 Gladiator was available in four trims: Sport, Willys, Mojave, and Rubicon, and sported nine different colors. Inside, the most significant upgrade was for the infotainment system. Starting with the 2024 model year, the Gladiator used a 12.5"" touchscreen fitted with the Uconnect 5 system. The new screen featured a new technology that allowed customers to see it better during sunny days with the roof retracted. It complemented the information from the 7"" TFT instrument cluster with data from the navigation system or the onboard computer. Still, the car offered enough comfort for five passengers. But Jeep knew that it had to work harder for the car's underpinnings. As a result, the drivetrain and the suspension went through a serious upgrade. The Gladiator was available with either a six-speed manual or an eight-speed automatic transmission that sent power in all corners via a transfer case. Depending on the car's version, the low-range gear was available with either a 2.7:1 ratio or a 4:1 gearing. The latter was reserved for the Gladiator Rubicon. Moreover, Jeep offered advanced shock absorbers that Fox Racing designed for this model and featured external reservoirs to compensate for the efforts. Even though the car used the same solid axles as its non-facelifted sibling, the new suspension setup provided more on-road comfort for its passengers without compromising the off-road capabilities. In addition, the five-link control arms, the locking differentials, and the sway-bar disconnect system (standard from the Mojave X grade up) ensured customers that they'll hardly lose control of the vehicle while off-roading.",JEEP,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Gladiator"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""off-road-oriented"", ""fresh"", ""rugged"", ""functional"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""integrated"", ""aerial antenna deleted""],    ""grille"": [""seven-slat"", ""black textured"", ""neutral gray metallic"", ""body-color surroundings""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""retractable""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
JEEP Renegade,"Jeep Renegade was first produced in 2014 and has gone a long way from its debut, improving the successful formula of the previous highly-appreciated models. With cutting edge systems and comprehensive equipment, the new Renegade goes beyond limits and offers a new engine range developed to ensure maximum fuel efficiency and performance both on and off-road. In Europe, the new Jeep Renegade complies with the Euro 6 / D standards and features GPF filter (Gasoline Particulate Filter) and is available in two configurations, front-wheel and four-wheel drive. The car is equipped with two four-wheel-drive systems, rear axle disconnect, Selec-Terrain traction control, Hill Start Assist and Hill Descent Control. Its 4x4 capability finds its best expression in the Trailhawk trim created for off-road driving and packed with specific, stylistic and technical upgrades. Also, it offers a fold-flat front passenger's seat for more cargo capacity. With new Traffic sign recognition system, new headlamps with full-LED daytime running lights, new turbo petrol engines that were tuned in over 75,000 hours of virtual analysis, 60,000 hours of off-vehicle testing and five million kilometres driven worldwide both on and off-road to test robustness and reliability, it is safe to say that the new Jeep Renegade has established itself as a robust car that you can depend on.",JEEP,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Jeep Renegade"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""robust"", ""stylish"", ""off-road"", ""efficient"", ""comprehensive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""modern"", ""sleek""],    ""grille"": [""aggressive"", ""distinctive""],    ""hood"": [""streamlined"", ""athletic""],    ""headlights"": [""full-LED"", ""new""],    ""bumper"": [""rugged"", ""protective""],    ""wheel"": [""off-road"", ""durable""],    ""doors"": [""functional"", ""spacious""],    ""roof"": [""aerodynamic"", ""sturdy""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
JEEP Compass,"Jeep introduced a significant facelift for the Compass range in 2021 and added more technology to a vehicle that could feel at home either in a parking lot or in front of a lodge in the mountains. The second generation of the Compass debuted in 2016 in Brazil and, later on, at the Los Angeles International Auto Show. Fast forward to early 2021, and the car had to go through a major refresh. There were new emission regulations and new standards to achieve, and the Compass received a mid-life cycle refresh. Even though it still sported the seven vertical slats on the grille, the 2021 version (launched as a 2022 model year) was more of an urban SUV than a hard-core off-roader. The car sported a new front bumper with integrated fog lights on the sides, extended towards the car's center with broad lines. Its headlights were narrower and featured LED daytime running lights at their top. From the sides, the profile remained similar but with a floating-roof design enhanced by the C-pillar's look. Inside, it was a major refresh. The carmaker installed a 10.25"" instrument cluster in front of the driver instead of classic, analog dials. On top of the center stack, mounted on the dashboard, Jeep placed the infotainment's system screen available with either an 8.4"" or a 10.1"" size. It was Android-based and offered wireless connection with either Android Auto or Apple CarPlay. Depending on the trim option, it offered a leather-clad interior or cloth upholstery. Under the hood, the 2021 Jeep Compass featured a range of gasoline, diesel, or hybrid powertrains. It was ranged between 130 hp and a respectable 240 hp for the top version. They were paired to either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic (Dual Clutch) gearbox.",JEEP,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Jeep Compass"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact urban SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""urban"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""refreshed"", ""stylish""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""vertical slats""],    ""hood"": [""broad lines""],    ""headlights"": [""narrower"", ""LED daytime running lights""],    ""bumper"": [""integrated fog lights"", ""front""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""floating"", ""enhanced by C-pillar""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
JEEP Grand Cherokee,"Jeep introduced the fifth generation of the Grand Cherokee lineup in 2021, and it proved worthy of its nameplate but added more luxurious and advanced technological solutions. After seven million units sold, the Grand Cherokee was already a respected and worldwide known product. Ever since its first generation, in 1992, it offered great off-road performance and a comfortable interior. Over the years, the American SUV became more and more luxurious and proved to be performant on highways too. The 2021 Grand Cherokee was so well designed that it even didn’t need a badge to recognize its brand and nameplate. Its seven vertical slats at the front were a distinctive sign for the Jeep brand, while its narrow headlights and fat bumper made a connection with its predecessors in terms of design. Jeep built the vehicle on the same platform used by the Stellantis group for the Alfa Romeo Stelvio. The designers managed to create a lower roofline for a sleeker appearance. The raked-forward C-pillars remained a clear characteristic for the Grand Cherokee. While the first generation of the Grand Cherokee sported a spartan interior with just a few amenities, the 2021 model could compete in the luxury segment thanks to the use of leather, high-tech, and comfort features. I provided 144.6 cu-ft (4,096 liters) of interior space for the cabin. When the rear, split-folding bench was lowered, it allowed a trunk increase of up to 37.7 cu-ft (1,067 liters). For the front occupants, Jeep installed a Uconnect infotainment system with up to three 10.1” screens. From the technical point of view, the most technologically advanced powertrain was the 4xe version. It featured a hybrid powerplant that combined a turbocharged inline-four and an electric motor mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission.",JEEP,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Grand Cherokee"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""Large"",  ""overall-design"": [""Luxurious"", ""Advanced"", ""Sleek"", ""Distinctive"", ""Comfortable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""Raked-forward""],    ""grille"": [""Seven vertical slats""],    ""hood"": [""Fat""],    ""headlights"": [""Narrow""],    ""bumper"": [""Fat""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""Lower roofline"", ""Raked-forward C-pillars""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
JEEP Cherokee,"Coming from a long line of rich heritage, the new Cherokee is packed with a fuel-efficient 2.2 litre MultiJet II turbo diesel engine (in Europe) with the choice of two power outputs – 150 and 195 hp – connected to a six-speed manual transmission or an enhanced nine-speed automatic gearbox respectively. Or for a more richer adventure, the 2.0 litre direct-injection turbocharged inline four-cylinder petrol engine, delivers around 270 hp and 400 Nm of torque, ensuring outstanding performance and fuel efficiency. The 4x4 capability of Jeep Cherokee is unmatched and provides comfort and stability throughout the entire journey in all weather conditions. Loaded with an array of safety and security systems, off-road journeys are now a stroll in the park, and with Uconnect Live, users can now listen to more than 100,000 stations from all around the world (Deezer included). Jeep Cherokee's evolution offers more interior comfort delivering everyday practicality with remarkable ride and handling characteristics. The Cherokee's interior has been updated with fresh and elegant touches for maximum comfort and it is characterised by stylish hand-sculpted forms, high-quality materials, craftsmanship and attention to details.

JEEP Wrangler Unlimited,"Jeep introduced the fourth generation of its well-known Wrangler in 2018 and offered it in two wheelbases and also added the Rubicon flavor to it. The Wrangler Rubicon was the most off-road capable vehicle in Jeep's inventory. With the four-door, long-wheelbase version, it became even more appealing for families. Thus, everybody could enjoy the great outdoors. At first sight, there were not too many changes in the car's shape when compared with its predecessor, the JK-generation. And yet, subtle modifications such as the more tilted windscreen, the LED headlights and fog lamps, and the rounded shapes were a clear statement of evolution. In addition, at the back of the car, Jeep installed a rear-view camera directly on the cradle that supported the spare wheel. From its profile, the exposed hinges and the high ground clearance were also a signature mark for the Rubicon as it was the seven-slat grille for the Jeep brand. While the exterior featured subtle changes, the interior was an important evolution. There were much nicer materials inside the Rubicon Unlimited. Jeep even offered an option for a leather-wrapped dashboard. Yet, the bucket seats at the front and the flat bench in the rear didn't provide any side support. The driver, on the other hand, could enjoy the start-button feature and the Uconnect infotainment system. In addition, a mix of digital and analog instrument panels provided all the information needed while driving. Just like its predecessors, the Wrangler relied on a sturdy chassis. Its stabilizer bars could've been disengaged for higher axle mobility. Moreover, the front and rear diff-locks were fitted as standard on the Rubicon version. Under the hood, Jeep installed a choice of three engines: a 3.6-liter V6, a 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline unit carried over from Fiat and a 3.0-liter turbo-diesel. All of them were available with either a six-speed manual or an eight-speed automatic.",JEEP,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Wrangler"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""two wheelbases"",  ""overall-design"": [""evolutionary"", ""off-road capable"", ""family-friendly""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""tilted""],    ""grille"": [""seven-slat""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""rounded""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""exposed hinges""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
JEEP Wagoneer,"While Jeep built the Grand Wagoneer for up to eight people and impressive comfort and luxury, the Wagoneer was more of a luxurious family SUV or executive car. Stellantis built the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer duo to match, and exceed, the offer from Lincoln Navigator and Cadillac Escalade. It was the most luxurious vehicle ever made by Jeep, and to do that, it started from a blank sheet of paper. The chassis, with its independent air suspension in four corners, and the bodywork were brand new. Its front fascia was almost like a flat wall with the seven-slats grille above the fat bumper. Its LED headlights incorporated the turn-signals at the top while the daytime running lights and the fog-lights found their way at the bottom of the bumper, above the fixed, exposed, tow-hooks. From its sides, the Wagoneer showed slightly curved, almost vertical panels. The carmaker installed slim LED strips for the taillights and a wide, tall tailgate. Like its bigger brother, the Wagoneer showed three trim levels, named simply 1, 2, or 3. For the driver, Jeep installed a TFT display in the instrument cluster and, depending on the trim level, one or more touch-screens on the center stack. Between the front leather-wrapped seats, there was a wide center console, which could incorporate a safe deposit box. The middle row was available with either a bench for three or captain seats with or without a center armrest. Even the third row, which was fit for three, could host three full-grown adults. Jeep installed a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 engine paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and a high and low gear transfer case. The adaptive air suspension could increase the ground clearance according to one of the four settings selected by the driver. Last but not least, it could tow up to 10,000 lbs (4,535 kg).",JEEP,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Wagoneer"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""impressive"", ""wide"", ""tall"", ""sophisticated""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""wide"", ""angled""],    ""grille"": [""seven-slats"", ""flat"", ""wide""],    ""hood"": [""bulging""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""incorporated turn-signals""],    ""bumper"": [""fat"", ""fixed"", ""exposed""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""wide""],    ""roof"": [""tall""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual""]  }}```"
JEEP Wrangler Rubicon,"While the 4xe-powered versions of the Wrangler topped the sales for plug-in hybrids in the SUV category, the Rubicon 392 topped the power range for this well-known off-roader. There are just a handful of vehicles that could go straight from the showroom to a hard off-road trail and pass it with flying colors, and the Rubicon is one of them. But there is more than just one version of this dune-bashing machine, but only one that can boast a 470 hp (477 PS) engine underneath its hood, and that's the Rubicon 392. Along with the rest of the Wrangler JL range, the Rubicon 392 also got updated in 2023 for the 2024 model-year, and it was unveiled both at the Easter Jeep Safari and the NYIAS. It boasted the same smaller grille at the front and the round headlights inherited from the legendary Willys. The SUV's front bumper was built to host an 8,000 lbs Warn winch behind it and extended bumper protections to comply with safety standards. Its 33"" BFGoodrich all-terrain tires and the special design for the wheels were unique to the Rubicon 392. Inside, there were massive upgrades compared with its predecessor. Atop the center stack, the automaker installed a 12"" touchscreen for the Uconnect 5 infotainment system. But Jeep also focused on customers' comfort and added power seats. Along with the new lineup, the Rubicon also got adaptive cruise control, side airbags, and blind spot monitor. This version also featured red embroidered Rubicon 392 lettering on its front seats seatbacks. Powered by a four-cylinder mill and an electric motor incorporated into the gearbox, the Rubicon 4xe proved that a PHEV can also forge through water, mud, and other difficult situations. Its locking differentials and the free-floating axle were part of the model 2024 upgrades.",JEEP,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Wrangler"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""off-road"", ""rugged"", ""powerful"", ""modern"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""functional""],    ""grille"": [""smaller"", ""round""],    ""hood"": [""N/A""],    ""headlights"": [""round""],    ""bumper"": [""extended"", ""protective""],    ""wheel"": [""special design""],    ""doors"": [""N/A""],    ""roof"": [""N/A""],    ""diffusor"": [""N/A""],    ""spoiler"": [""N/A""],    ""exhaust"": [""N/A""]  }}```"
JEEP Avenger,"After testing the market with electrified versions for the Wrangler and the Renegade, Jeep made the final step toward ditching the internal combustion engines for its new Avenger lineup. Jeep took the Avenger nameplate from Dodge, but instead of using it on a coupe, it placed it on a sub-compact crossover vehicle. It marked a new era for the American carmaker, which had to make the switch to electric power and lower its average brand emission values. The Avenger is a new product based on an existing platform. Its shape still resembles the Renegade, but with a much sleeker profile. At the front, the vehicle boasts the same seven-slat grille common for all Jeeps, albeit this one is narrower. Furthermore, the electric-only version didn't even feature a venting area to cool the engine since there was none. The lower bumper, on the other hand, still sported a broad air intake needed to cool the battery pack and the car's electronic system. From its profile, the Avenger features a slightly ascending beltline towards the C-pillar, which creates a floating roof appearance. At the back, the LED taillights were mounted on the quarter panels, narrowing the tailgate. Inside, the carmaker stepped into the XXI-st century with an updated digital infotainment system and a TFT display instead of the classic, analog instrument panel. Just like its Renegade sibling, it offered slightly side-bolstered seats that provided some side support. The narrow and twisty European roads demand such an approach. Under the hood, Jeep installed either a plug-in hybrid version or an all-electric drivetrain. While the former was already known for its Renegade sibling, the latter was new and provided up to 400 km (248 miles) range.",JEEP,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Avenger"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""sub-compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek profile"", ""narrow grille"", ""ascending beltline"", ""floating roof"", ""narrowing tailgate""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""narrow""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""broad air intake""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""floating""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
Karma Revero GT,"Karma unveiled the Revero GT at the Auto Shanghai in 2019, and it was a promise for those looking for a four-door sports car fitted with a hybrid drivetrain. After Henrik Fisker failed to sell enough models of the Karma lineup that was launched in 2011, his company went bankrupt. But his ideas were good. Moreover, the design of his car was so good that almost a decade later, the re-born Karma brand, under new management, created the Revero lineup, starting with the GT version. Like the Fisker Karma, the Revero GT featured elongated bodywork with a low engine compartment. The curved panels and arched lines created the image of a fluid. In addition, the four-door GT sported an ascending beltline towards the back of the car, onto the short trunk. At the front, the teardrop-shaped headlights featured LEDs and incorporated the daytime running lights, while the broad grille stretched wide into the bumper. A second lower grille found its place into the apron. Inside, the automaker installed two high-bolstered bucket seats at the front, separated by a tall center console. A generous touchscreen display adorned the center stack, while a TFT display was on duty as an instrument panel. At the back, the automaker installed two separate seats, also divided by a tall console. Thus, the Karma GT provided four cozy seats, all leather-wrapped and hand-stitched. The drivetrain consisted of a turbocharged inline-three supplied by BMW and acted like an onboard electric generator. The car's total driving range was up to 360 miles (580 km) on a single charge and a fuel tank of gas. It also provided an up to 80 miles (129 km) full-electric range.",Karma,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Revero GT"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""elongated"",  ""overall-design"": [""fluid"", ""sporty"", ""elegant""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""curved""],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""wide""],    ""hood"": [""low""],    ""headlights"": [""teardrop-shaped"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""wide""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""four-door""],    ""roof"": [""short""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
Karma Revero GTS,"Unveiled at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show, the Karma Revero GTS is a performance version of the Revero GT, which is itself a heavily revised and renamed version of the ill-fated Fisker Karma. Thanks to a number of performance upgrades, the Revero GTS has a 0 to 60 mph acceleration time of just 3.9 seconds, which is quite a feat especially alongside features like the two electric motors and electronic torque vectoring on all four wheels. Since it is based on the Revero GT, the GTS version is largely identical from a technical standpoint, with the dual electric motors being supplemented by a turbocharged three-cylinder internal combustion engine, which was sourced from BMW and acts like an on-board electric generator. The car's total driving range is up to 360 miles on a single charge a one gas tank, with up to 80 miles of emission-free all-electric driving with the juice from a 28 kWh NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) lithium-ion battery. Despite its accelerative performance, the model is electronically limited to 130 mph, but would probably do a lot more if unrestricted and with different gearing. Karma Revero GTS drivers can select from three different driving modes, which can either transform the car into a pure EV, turn on the ICE generator to preserve the battery charge or combine the output from both the battery and the generator for maximum performance.",Karma,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Karma Revero GTS"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA Picanto,"The Korean automaker introduced a second refresh for the third generation of the Picanto at the beginning of 2023. Thus, the seven-year-old model became more attractive to customers who didn't want to spend too much on transportation. Kia used to be that automaker that produced cheap but reliable vehicles. Over the years, the Korean company invested more in technology and became a major player on the world stage. Moreover, it climbed high in the reliability tops with its cars. But, besides its most-known products, such as the Ceed, the Sportage, or the Optima, it also produced the tiny Picanto. Previously, it was a vehicle that impressed only a few people with its design. But all that was changed in 2023, along with the second facelift of the car, which occurred three years after the first refresh and six after the model's introduction. The front fascia started to resemble other Kia products with its continuous LED light strip that crossed the vehicle from side to side, visually connecting the headlights. Moreover, the GT-Line version featured an air dam adorned with a shiny black rim underlining the lower cooling area. Moreover, the lower grille also hosted the radar for advanced safety systems such as the AEBS or the adaptive cruise control. Usually, that kind of design was mostly seen in sports cars, and the Picanto was far from being one. In addition, the automaker installed additional scoops on the sides that mimicked air intakes to cool the brakes, but those were not functional. The headlights featured three stacked LED lamps and were flanked on their outer sides by vertical daytime running lights. The car's shape didn't change, but at the rear, the automaker installed new taillights and, at the lower part of the bumper, a plastic diffuser. Inside, the Picanto boasted a digital instrument cluster, which, together with the touchscreen for the infotainment system placed atop the center stack, created a modern-looking digital dashboard. In 2023, there were still many larger and more expensive vehicles that still featured analog dials. At the front, Kia installed high-mounted seats that offered little to no bolstering areas. After all, it was a vehicle designed for cities, not for high-speed cornering. Between the front passengers, the carmaker placed the gear stick, while on the center stack, added an option for a wireless charger. In the back, there was hardly room for three adults on the split-folding bench seat. Behind them, the hatchback featured a tiny trunk that was good enough for a backpack and a couple of lunch bags. Under the hood, Kia installed a choice of two engines, one liter and 1.5-liter, respectively. Both versions sent their power to the front wheels via either a five-speed manual or a five-speed automatic (automated), depending on the market.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Picanto"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""tiny"",  ""overall-design"": [""modern"", ""attractive"", ""compact""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""continuous LED light strip"", ""shiny black rim"", ""lower grille with radar""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""three stacked LED lamps"", ""vertical daytime running lights""],    ""bumper"": [""plastic diffuser""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""plastic""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA XCeed,"Slotted between the small-sized Kia Stonic and the Niro, the Xceed enlarged the offering for the Ceed lineup by adding a crossover flavor to the already appealing Korean hatchback. Kia considered that it didn't have enough crossovers and SUVs in its lineup and increased the ground clearance of a Ceed hatchback, added some plastic trims around the wheel arches, and called it Xceed. But that was in 2018. Come 2022, Kia refreshed the Ceed lineup, which led to an upgrade for the Xceed as well. The new, facelifted version came with a new grille and LED headlights. At the front, the chromed trim around the main grille emphasized the tiger-nose design theme created by Peter Schreyer for Kia in 2006. Underneath, the bumper sported a second grille fitted with a black mesh grille and flanked by boomerang-shaped trims and a pair of side scoops. From its profile, the Xceed showed a higher ground clearance than its regular hatchback sibling, and a set of black trims adorned the wheel arches. On top of the vehicle, the carmaker added roof rails as standard. The back of the car revealed a new rear apron, with a mix of black and body-color elements but no tailpipes in sight. Inside, Kia updated the infotainment system mounted on top of the center stack in a floating-design position. Inside the instrument cluster, an improved 12.3"" digital instrument cluster provided all the required information for the driver. Depending on the options and packages, the Xceed offered a pair of sports seats at the front, while the 40-20-40 split-folding rear bench was similar for the entire range. That could enlarge the trunk space from a generous 426 liters (15 cu-ft) to an impressive 1,378 liters (48.6 cu-ft). Under the hood, Kia installed a choice of three engines, ranging between 118 hp (120 PS) and 201 hp (204 PS). In addition, a 139 hp (141 PS ) PHEV version was available as well.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Xceed"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""small-sized crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""crossover flavor"", ""facelifted"", ""higher ground clearance"", ""roof rails"", ""digital instrument cluster""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""new"", ""chromed trim"", ""tiger-nose design""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""second grille"", ""boomerang-shaped trims"", ""side scoops""],    ""wheel"": [""plastic trims"", ""black trims""],    ""doors"": [""standard""],    ""roof"": [""roof rails""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA Telluride,"Kia developed the Telluride, especially for the U.S. market, and unveiled it in 2019 with high hopes for its flagship SUV. But unfortunately, the world pandemic and the chip shortage hurt the sales of this big rig. Come 2022, the Korean carmaker unveiled a facelifted version for the Telluride, bringing more features and an improved design. Moreover, the interior received other upgrades that made it compete against the best premium SUVs on the market. Last but not least, their car was offered with two new trim levels: X-Line and X-Pro. At the front, the carmaker introduced new LED headlights with a vertical design. They flanked the redesigned grille, which featured a fence-like pattern instead of the formerly used hexagonal one. In addition, the new logo took center stage instead of the former oval-shaped badge. Finally, in the lower bumper, in the apron, the carmaker added a pair of fog lights on each side. Inside, the most significant upgrade was for the dashboard. Kia installed as an option two 12.3” screens seamlessly connected; one for the instrument cluster and the other, atop the center stack, for the infotainment unit. The new setup replaced the previously used one that sported a set of 10.3” screens. Moreover, with its improved infotainment unit, the Telluride allowed users to use digital keys installed on their Apple Watches, iPhones, or Samsung Galaxy phones. Under the hood, the same 3.8-liter engine Atkinson Cycle that provided 291 horses paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Since it sent all the oomph in all corners, the Telluride, with its four-wheel independent suspension, was not afraid of some off-road expeditions.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Telluride"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""big"",  ""overall-design"": [""facelifted"", ""improved"", ""premium"", ""fence-like pattern"", ""vertical LED headlights""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""redesigned"", ""fence-like pattern""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""vertical""],    ""bumper"": [""lower"", ""apron"", ""pair of fog lights""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA Seltos,"Kia unveiled the refreshed 2024 model year of the Seltos SUV at the 2022 Los Angeles Auto Show, upgrading the car's design and features. Sharing its platform with Hyundai Kona, the Seltos was introduced on the market in 2019 for selected countries worldwide, but not in Europe. There, the more affordable SUV could've cannibalized its bigger brother, the Sportage. That decision stayed in place even after the introduction of the facelifted version, which happened in 2022. Sporting a completely redesigned front fascia, the 2024 Seltos received a satin-silver trim between the grille and the hood. In addition, the LED headlights featured new vertical fog lamps integrated with C-shaped daytime running lights. The car also received a new bumper with sharper shapes for a more rugged, meaner look. Last but not least, the 2024 Seltos sported Kia's new logo. Inside, customers were greeted with a high-tech interior, where the carmaker offered an option for two wide-screen displays: a 10.25-inch instrument panel continued above the center stack by a 10.25-inch for the infotainment unit. For lesser-equipped versions, Kia installed a new 4.2"" instrument panel with digital gauges. Another significant upgrade was made for the drivetrain, where the Seltos received an improved 1.6-liter turbocharged GDI unit that gained 20 more horses for a total of 195 HP (198 PS).",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Seltos"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""compact SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""rugged"", ""mean"", ""high-tech"", ""improved""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""satin-silver"", ""redesigned""],    ""hood"": [""satin-silver""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""vertical"", ""C-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [""new"", ""sharper""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA Soul,"Kia refreshed the Soul lineup for the 2023 model and unveiled it at the beginning of 2022, boasting a wider choice of trim levels and increasing the safety features. When the Korean carmaker introduced the first generation of the Soul in 2008, it was a surprise on the market. Few people expected that shape from Kia. Moreover, the vehicle appeared during the world financial crisis when the automotive world was badly wounded. And yet, by 2019, the Soul reached its third generation, and it was already available with electric and electrified powertrains. Three years after the model's introduction, the carmaker refreshed the lineup. The front of the vehicle featured the most distinctive visual change of the car. Its narrow headlights and the slim line between them, combined with the broad lower grille on the lower bumper, offered a front fascia that resembled the Star Troopers. The Soul's profile kept the same two-box shape but enhanced with a black area on the C-pillar to give the impression of a floating roof. As expected, all lights (headlights and taillights) sported LEDs. Kia offered the Soul in no less than five trim levels, starting with the LX and going up to the GT-Line Tech level. Apart from the former, all the other versions featured a 10.25"" touchscreen placed atop the center stack. Another improvement was on the safe side, where Kia added Blind Spot Collision Avoidance (BCA) and Rear Cross Collision Avoidance (RCCA) for the base trim level. The biggest surprise was under the hood, where Kia dropped all engines but one. It left the Soul just with the 2.0-liter inline-four that driven the front wheels via an automatic (CVT) transmission.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Soul"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""distinctive"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""futuristic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""narrow""],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""lower""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""narrow"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""lower""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""floating""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA Carnival / Sedona,"The 2021 Kia Carnival on U.S. soil was the moment when the Korean carmaker placed its new logo onto a vehicle, and that was a large MPV. Minivans were not that much popular as they were in the late '90s, and the SUVs were the keys to success. Kia took a different approach and designed an MPV like an SUV or the other way around. The Carnival/Sedona was introduced in late 2020 for other markets with the older, oval logo, while for the U.S. premiere, it brought it with the new one with stylized lettering that could be read as KIA or, with Russian letters, as KI. The 2021 Carnival/Sedona looked like an SUV with rear sliding doors and a lower ground clearance. Its distinct, two-box bodywork featured a hood almost parallel to the ground, like most big-sized SUVs such as the 2017 Ford Expedition or the 2020 Chevrolet Tahoe. Its very long rear sliding doors and the raked forward C-pillar were a new design pattern for the Korean MPV. Inside, Kia arranged up to three rows of seats for eight occupants. The middle seats from the second row could slide and be tilted for more comfort, while the middle seat could have been completely removed for easier access to the third row. Kia installed a pair of wide seats and a premium-looking dashboard with wood, leather, and metallic trims at the front. Depending on the trim level, the Carnival/Sedona featured analog dials for the instrument panel or a TFT display. Kia installed a wide touch-screen on top of the center stack for the infotainment unit. Kia installed a choice of two engines in the Carnival/Sedona, depending on the market. Its 3.5-liter V-6 was available on all the markets, while the turbo-diesel was not. The carmaker paired both versions to an 8-speed automatic transmission that sent the power to the front wheels.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Kia Carnival"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""large MPV"",  ""overall-design"": [""distinct"", ""two-box bodywork"", ""SUV-like design"", ""premium-looking dashboard"", ""wide touch-screen""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked forward""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""almost parallel to the ground""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""rear sliding"", ""long""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA Sportage,"Kia unveiled the hybrid version of the fifth generation of the Sportage at the 2021 Los Angeles Auto Show. The Sportage was already a well-known product on the market on both sides of the Atlantic. While it debuted as a humble and one of the shortest cars in its segment, by 2022, it became one of the longest. However, if the first generation was more of a rugged, body-on-frame vehicle (not available on all markets), the 2023 model year was a global product with upmarket flavor. On the outside, there were few differences between the HEV and the rest of the Sportage range. It featured the same floating-design look for the “Tiger-nose” element on the front fascia and the boomerang-style LED daytime running lights. At the back, the notch-shaped taillights looked united via a black line that crossed the vehicle from side to side. In addition, a small HEV badge adorned the tailgate. But the most distinct element that differentiated the exterior of the hybrid version from the rest of the range was the unique design for the 17” or 18” alloy wheels. The interior looked just as futuristic as the exterior. The dashboard sported a 25” wide display that combined the 12.3” instrument panel with the 12.3” touchscreen for the infotainment system under the same piece of glass. Thanks to the asymmetrically designed dashboard, the driver had access to most buttons and controls. At the same time, the side passenger was spoiled with more legroom and an airy feeling. Depending on the trim levels and options, a Harman-Kardon sound system transformed the Korean SUV into a concert hall on wheels. But the drivetrain was the most essential difference between the HEV and the rest of its siblings. A 1.6-liter turbocharged and direct fuel-injected engine provided 226 hp (229 PS) to a standard six-speed automatic gearbox. In addition, a 44 kW motor helped the SUV achieve outstanding fuel efficiency for its class. Furthermore, the Sportage HEV was fitted with front or all-wheel drive systems depending on the trim level.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Sportage"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""longest"",  ""overall-design"": [""futuristic"", ""upmarket"", ""distinct"", ""unique"", ""asymmetric""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""Tiger-nose"", ""floating-design""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""boomerang-style"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""17\"" or 18\"" alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA Stinger,"When Kia introduced the Stinger in 2017, it was like poking a wasp nest with a stick, and the automotive world was in shock: it aimed directly at the Audi A5/BMW 4 Series GT customers. The Korean carmaker didn't want to make another right car for common people. It tried, and succeeded, to build a driver's car with four doors. When it was launched, everyone tried to find parts of the car that resembled other vehicles on the market, but Kia couldn't care more about that. It just charged forward with its turbocharged engines and rear- or all-wheel-drive systems. Then, in 2021, it charged even harder with the facelifted version. Kia changed its logo at the beginning of 2021, and the Stinger came fitted with it. Overall, there were no significant changes in the car's look, and that was fine since it already looked great. The carmaker upgraded the headlights and taillights to an LED system, which provided more light and less energy consumption. Inside, there was a new 10.3"" touch-screen on top of the center stack. But the instrument cluster still kept the analog dials while the carmaker didn't consider that it was necessary to replace them with a TFT display. The most significant change was under the hood. Kia dropped the turbocharged 2.0-liter unit and introduced the 2.5-liter version as the base model. The new four-pot unit provided 300 hp, 45 more than on its predecessors. The 3.3-liter V-6 remained the same.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Stinger"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""driver's car"", ""turbocharged"", ""facelifted"", ""LED headlights"", ""10.3\"" touch-screen""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""upgraded""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""four""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""turbocharged""]  }}```"
KIA Ceed,"After just three years on the market, the third generation of the Kia Ceed received a refreshed version, with a revised exterior design and improved powertrains. When the Korean carmaker introduced its new logo and new corporate image, most of its cars were new and still had the older badge. Along with their facelifted versions, though, they received the new, clear logo. Moreover, when it updated the Ceed, the carmaker improved also the safety systems as well. Some of the changes were mandatory, while the carmaker offered others as a bonus package. From the outside, the 2022 model-year Ceed showed a revised front fascia, sporting the new badge on the hood's edge. Also, the compact-segment vehicle featured a new grille with a restyled ""tiger-nose"" signature. In addition, Kia improved the design of the headlights with full-LED units for the GT-line package, which also sported a more aggressive front bumper, 17"" light-alloy wheels, and a roof spoiler. Inside, the carmaker installed bucket seats with a choice of nine upholstery finishes, including black suede leather with contrasting stitching in gray for the GT-Line, and signature red for the GT models. For the instrument panel, Kia installed a large, 12.3-inch display instead of the regular analog dials. It was complemented on the center stack by a 10.25"" touch-screen for the infotainment unit. Under the hood, the carmaker offered a choice of gasoline, diesel, and mild-hybrid drivetrains paired with either a manual gearbox or a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch).",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Kia Ceed"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""sporty"", ""modern"", ""aggressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""new"", ""restyled"", ""tiger-nose""],    ""hood"": [""badge""],    ""headlights"": [""full-LED"", ""improved""],    ""bumper"": [""aggressive""],    ""wheel"": [""17-inch light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA Forte,"Kia refreshed its small-segment sedan contender, the Forte. When Chevrolet and Ford axed most of their lower-priced sedans, the Korean carmaker charged ahead and brought premium features in a class where the price was the most critical selling point. The Korean carmaker introduced the facelift for the Forte's third generation in 2020 for the 2022 model year. Even though it was during the world pandemic situation, Kia tried to keep its promises to its clients. With a refreshed front fascia that featured narrower headlights, with an option for LED foglights, depending on the trim level. Also, it included redesigned LED taillights. The carmaker added new light-alloy wheels with 16"" and 17"" sizes for the drivetrain, depending on the trim level. Inside, all versions received a new TFT instrument cluster that replaced the analog-dial system featured on the 2018 model year. An 8"" or 10.25"" touchscreen was installed on top of the center stack, depending on the trim level. Kia also offered a Harman Kardon sound system, usually found in premium vehicles. Kia added a set of leather-wrapped front bucket seats with red logos embroidered on the seatbacks for the newly introduced GT trim level. All Forte versions came fitted with six standard ADAS (Advanced Driving Assistant Systems) and up to 15 available as an option for the safety department. Under the hood, the carmaker offered the Forte with a choice of two engines, which provided 147 hp and 201 hp, respectively.

KIA Optima / Magentis,"The Korean car-maker Kia unveiled the fifth generation of the Optima K5 in 2019 as a 2020 model year. It was based on the same platform as the Hyundai Sonata. Despite the ascending trend for the SUV segment, Kia decided to keep the K5 sedan in its lineup for those who doesn't look for expeditions and doesn't need or want an SUV. A light sedan could provide the same comfort and amenities as an SUV but being more fuel-efficient at the same time. The new design language adopted by Kia for the Optima K5 was different than before, with angular shapes and a ""Shark-skin"" mesh-grill. It was not an evolution over its predecessor, but more like a leap. Despite being introduced in 2019, the marketing department decided not to fit the taillights with LED as standard, but to offer them on the options list, or only for the upper trim levels. It used the same strategy with headlights, and only the fog lights and the DRLs were with LED as standard. The interior was another leap, with tons of gadgets and technologies available either as standard or on the options list. The infotainment system was floating on top of the center stack and almost got into the instrument panel. For the gear selector, Kia introduced an ""aircraft-like"" design, with a flat knob on top of it. The car-maker arranged a comfortable bench and enough legroom and headroom for the rear passengers despite the sloped roofline. Under the hood, the K5 featured a choice of two engines. The base model featured a 1.6-liter unit while the top version was fitted with a 2.5-liter unit. All of them were turbocharged and feed via a direct fuel injection system.

KIA Sorento,"Most probably, 10 years ago, we would’ve never though that KIA would evolve the way they did over the past years. And since their cars became better and better, their cost increased as well. The KIA Sorento’s price launched in 2020 was the highest compared to the previous models and had a lot to offer. The most notable aspect is that the new Sorento offered 7 seats and that made it an ideal car for large families. The Sorento came with only one engine version, a 2.2-liter diesel developing 198 hp. It was available with a 4-wheel drive and the standard included a 6-speed manual transmission. Buyers also had the option to choose an 8-speed automatic transmission. The interior offered comfort due to the available adjustments for the seats (8-way electric adjustments or a 10-way electric adjustments available for the KX-3 and the GT Line S trim levels). The controls were intuitively placed, in a way that allows the driver to use them in a safely manner. For a non-premium SUV, the materials used did not look cheap, moreover, the dashboard looked as if it was all wrapped up in leather. The road visibility offered by the Sorento was beyond reproach, due to its large windscreen and the “throne-like” seating position, plus thins pillars. The overall feeling was of safety and control. The infotainment system offered both Apple Car Play and Android Auto, with a 7.0 inch or a 8.0 inch touchscreen depending on the trim level. The more expensive trim levels offered improved audio with the aid of 10 Harman Kardon speakers.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Sorento"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""comfortable"", ""safety"", ""intuitive"", ""premium"", ""spacious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""large""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA Niro,"Kia decided to gift the successful Niro Hybrid compact crossover with an early mid-cycle facelift in 2019, with the model receiving a host of several exterior and interior enhancements alongside improved technology features. Part of the extensive design refresh, the car now features new projector-type headlamps and fog lamps, a redesigned diamond-pattern grille and chevron-shaped LED daytime running lights on the front end. At the rear there is a new fake skid plate that is wider and more pronounced for a bolder, more off-road-ready look and a new LED combination taillight design. On the inside the modifications are even more extensive, with the 7-inch instrument cluster having been redesigned alongside the standard 8-inch touchscreen display on the center console. A navigation system with a 10.25-inch screen is optional, as is a premium audio system from Harman Kardon. Sporty paddle shifters to give the driver more control are also optionally available. The so-called Kia Drive Wise Advanced Driver Assistance Systems have been updated to also include Lane Following and Lane Keeping Assist, while the headlights now have a High Beam Assist function. Powertrain and overall exterior and interior dimensions have remained completely unchanged from the non-facelift Niro Hybrid, and so have the performance and fuel economy figures.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Niro Hybrid"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""compact crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""sporty"", ""off-road-ready"", ""bolder"", ""extensive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""redesigned"", ""diamond-pattern"", ""chevron-shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""new projector-type"", ""LED daytime running""],    ""bumper"": [""new fake skid plate""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA K9,"If the Stinger was considered a beautiful sedan, the K900 was definitely better than it. The K9 was fully redesigned for 2019 and we could say it was the enlarged Stinger’s brother. The exterior of the K9 was rather friendly than aggressive, with standard full LED headlights and the already standard Kia grille – the producer said that the grille was designed to look like it’s made of diamonds. Looking to the side, we could notice how big the K9 really was, however, the back was a combination between a Mercedes and a Bentley; a beautiful one, nevertheless. The back also featured dual exhausts and a single led reverse light. If the exterior was not that out of the ordinary, things changed with the interior. The interior of the K9 was the true definition of luxury, with soft touch materials, leather, piano black and wood inserts. In the center of the dashboard we could find a designer analogue clock. Does that ring a bell? Mercedes? The power seats had 12-way orr 14-way adjustments and were both heated and cooled. A 17-speak audio system added to the luxurious sedan, with a crystal clear sound. The 12-inch touchscreen display ran extremely smooth and could have also been control by using the command control knob. The downsides of the K9? No doors soft close, no massage seats. Wait. A starting price of $59.900 – that is pretty average for a luxury car!",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""K9"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""friendly"", ""luxurious"", ""beautiful"", ""enlarged"", ""standard""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""diamond-like""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""full LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""no soft close""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual""],    ""interior"": [""luxury"", ""soft touch"", ""piano black"", ""wood inserts"", ""analog clock"", ""power seats"", ""heated"", ""cooled"", ""audio system"", ""touchscreen display""]  }}```"
KIA Rio Hatchback,"In late 2020, Kia introduced the facelifted version of the sub-compact range Rio. It brought a breath of fresh air to a car introduced in 2017. The fourth generation of Rio was designed in Kia's design centers from Russelsheim (Germany) and California. It was no longer a car built for a low budget, but more of a car built to offer the most for its price. The 2021 version enhanced the visual elements and brought more technologies under the skin. For the 2021 model, Kia designers introduced a massive grille in the lower part of the bumper, despite the small engines. The car's performances did not exactly match its aggressive look, but at least it was a more pleasant view when compared with the non-facelifted version. The angular headlights showed LED daytime running lights around the inner headlamps. The fog lights found their way into the side scoops, used as fake air-intakes to cool the disc brakes. The interior showed more respect for the customers, and it helped the driver with a new infotainment unit offered as an option, with an 8"" touch-screen placed on top of the center stack. The instrument cluster featured traditional, analog dials from its predecessor. The powertrain was enhanced with a starter-generator that helped the car to comply and exceed the Euro 6d norms. The 1.2-liter and the 1.0-liter mild-hybrid engines were paired as standard with a manual transmission, while the latter unit was available with a 7-speed DCT (dual-clutch) automatic transmission.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Rio"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""sub-compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""angular"", ""enhanced"", ""modern"", ""efficient""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""lower-positioned""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angular"", ""LED"", ""daytime running""],    ""bumper"": [""enhanced"", ""lower-positioned""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA Pro cee'd,"Kia totally re-imagined the ProCeed from the ground up gave it a new bodywork and a new designation as a shooting brake. The automaker thought that those kids who grew up loving the Pro_cee'd first generation would go for the new ProCeed, and now they need more interior room for their family. Over the years, the humble Kia cee'd evolved in many ways, and the nameplate was just one of them. As a result, the former Pro_cee'd became ProCeed, and the three-door hatchback evolved into a sporty-looking station wagon. Even though it was not exactly a true shooting brake since it had four doors plus the tailgate, it looked like one. At the front, the car sported a fresh front fascia, which featured the “Tiger-nose” design language imagined by Kia's lead designer, Peter Schreyer. He was known as the father of the Audi TT's first generation, and he had a love for sporty-looking vehicles. As a result, the ProCeed was the car that inspired him, and, besides the new aggressive-looking grille, there were the swept-back headlights adorned with LED daytime running lights. On the lower part of the bumper, the designer placed a second grille with a trapezoidal shape flanked by triangular, vertical side scoops for the fog lamps. From its profile, the ProCeed featured a long roofline sloped down towards the back of the car. It was not as practical as a regular station wagon, but it looked better. The sculptured door panels, the flush door handles, and the darkened B- and C-pillars made the car look like a shooting brake. Furthermore, at the rear, the automaker installed slim taillights that emerged from the rear quarter panels to the tailgate. As a final touch, underneath the bumper, Kia installed fake exhaust tips, emphasizing the car's sporty character. Inside, the automaker improved the materials' quality and enhanced the whole cabin. In front of the driver, the ProCeed featured a well-arranged instrument cluster with two large dials for the tachometer on the left and the speedometer on the right. They flanked a center-mounted TFT display for the onboard computer. Atop the center stack, Kia placed the infotainment's unit 7” touchscreen in a free-floating position. Thus, it joined the trend in the automotive industry, ditching the former integrated screens approach. The driver and their side passengers sat on high-bolstered seats separated by a tall center console that housed the gear selector (or the gear stick for vehicles fitted with a manual gearbox), a pair of cup holders with a sliding lid, and a storage compartment under the center armrest. At the back, the split-folding bench seat was wide enough for three passengers, although the headroom was diminished by the roof's shape. The trunk could hold up to 594 liters (21 cu-ft) of luggage, and owners could expand it by folding down the rear seats seatback. Under the hood, Kia installed a range of turbocharged gasoline or diesel engines ranging from 140 PS (138 HP) to 204 PS (201 HP) paired with either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic. The ProCeed was available exclusively as a front-wheel-drive vehicle.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""ProCeed"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""aggressive"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""practical""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""swept-back""],    ""grille"": [""aggressive"", ""trapezoidal""],    ""hood"": [""sculptured""],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back"", ""LED-adorned""],    ""bumper"": [""sporty"", ""trapezoidal""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""flush"", ""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [""long"", ""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""fake""]  }}```"
KIA Optima Sportswagon,"Kia introduced the fourth generation of the Optima in 2016, and just two years later, the carmaker introduced a facelifted version at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show. The Korean carmaker was on the verge of improving its products and relentlessly worked on its models. By the time the first 2016 Optima was sold, the designers and engineers worked double-time to introduce a new version in 2018, and they made it. Imagined as a sporty-sedan, the Optima received a station-wagon brother, which was named Sportswagon. It shared the same front fascia with its three-door sibling that showed the new “tiger-nose” design language on the grille. In the back, the car sported a sloped tailgate and a diffuser under the bumper. Inside, Kia installed a German-inspired dashboard design with an integrated infotainment screen. Its high center console split the front area into two separate clusters for the driver and its side passenger. The high-bolstered bucket seats confirmed that the car was made more for spirited driving rather than relaxed ones. There was room for three adult-sized passengers in the rear, thanks to the very low center tunnel that made the floor look almost flat. Under the hood, Kia installed three gasoline, one diesel, and one hybrid powerplant, paired with a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed automatic (dual-clutch).",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Optima"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""mid-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""dynamic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""tiger-nose""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""diffuser""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""three-door""],    ""roof"": [""station-wagon""],    ""diffusor"": [""under the bumper""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA K7 / Cadenza,"Kia unveiled its new K7 at the 2015 New York Motor show in 2015 as a 2017 model-year. It was a large sedan, with a V6 engine under the hood and it was screaming for attention. Kia was known for building cheap and reliable cars. Only the idea that the Korean brand could produce a luxury vehicle was considered a joke. But the Asian car-manufacturer didn't care about the jokes and marched its way toward the top of the sales and squeezed its cars between other car-makers. The main pillars of its evolution were design and reliability. The performances didn't matter too much. But the Cadenza came and changed perceptions. With aggressive styling and Peter Schreyer panel, the second generation of the Cadenza appeared with narrow headlights and the “tiger-nose” grille design. The ascending beltline completed the sporty image of the car that could claim a spot in the sports sedan market. The 18” light-alloy wheels were standard-fit, while a set of 19” was offered as an option. Inside, the technology was at the same level as other car manufacturers. It included an infotainment unit that was compatible with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The interior room was high and it offered high-quality materials. The instrument cluster featured a mix of analog dials and LCD display. Under the hood, the Cadenza featured a 3.3-liter V6 engine mated to an in-house developed 8-speed automatic transmission.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""K7"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""large sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""sporty"", ""luxury"", ""reliable"", ""high-quality""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""tiger-nose""],    ""hood"": [""aggressive""],    ""headlights"": [""narrow""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""18-inch"", ""19-inch"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA Forte 5 Door,"Kia introduced the second generation of the Forte lineup in 2016 for the 2017 model year, and, along with the sedan, it also offered a fived-door version named Forte5. Designed as an affordable vehicle, the Forte5 was made by Kia on the same platform as the Hyundai Elantra and the European Kia Ceed. Thus, the carmaker was able not only to provide a lower-priced vehicle but also a well-equipped one, which could have offered enough features for an economical transportation solution. Its design followed the renewed version of the ""Tiger nose"" concept imagined by Peter Schreyer when he took over Kia's design department. It resembled a similar look as Forte5's bigger sibling, the Optima. The angular headlights swept back offered a sporty look for the hatchback. Moreover, the front bumper featured a broad lower grille flanked on the sides by the foglights. Inside, the carmaker tried to provide the vehicle with everything a modern person needed in 2017. Thus, it installed as an option an Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatible infotainment system. Even though the latter was not available at the car's launch. Kia offered the Forte5 in three trim levels: LX, EX, and SX, the latter being the sportiest in the stable. It offered bolstered bucket seats at the front and a split-folding bench in the rear. Even though the trunk was not something to brag about, it had a decent size for regular, two-people use. Under the hood, Kia installed a choice of two engines. One was the older 2.0-liter GDI (Gasoline Direct Injection) unit, and the most potent version was the 1.6-liter turbocharged GDI. Both units were paired as standard to a six-speed manual, with an option for a six-speed automatic or a seven-speed (dual-clutch), respectively.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Forte5"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""affordable"", ""sporty"", ""angular"", ""modern"", ""well-equipped""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angular"", ""swept back""],    ""bumper"": [""front"", ""broad""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA Forte Koup,"In 2013, Kia launched the second generation of its compact coupe named Koup. It is based on the Forte and it lost two doors on the way. It is a car addressed to younger people. It has two doors and five seats. The Koup entered in the sport-compact coupe vehicles, to get a slice of the market share. It used the same recipe as with other models: low price, good equipment, and decent performance. It wasn't up to pace with other vehicles in the segment, but it was close. The design team led by Peter Schreyer did a good job. This segment is very weak in offers, and most of the competitors were hatchbacks, not coupes. But this was also a drawback since the headroom was not that great. Inside the cabin, the driver could get heated steering wheel, heated and cooled seats, a 7” touchscreen infotainment system and some sporty details such as the aluminum pedals and paddle-shifters for the 6-speed automatic gearbox. From the technical point of view, the Koup was available with two engine choices. A 2.4-liter naturally aspirated and a 1.6-liter turbo. Both featured direct injection. The available transmission was either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic. The four-wheel independent suspension provided good cornering abilities and enough comfort.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Koup"",  ""year"": ""2013"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""youthful"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""modern""],    ""hood"": [""sleek""],    ""headlights"": [""sporty""],    ""bumper"": [""aggressive""],    ""wheel"": [""stylish""],    ""doors"": [""two-door""],    ""roof"": [""low-profile""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual-exhaust""]  }}```"
KIA Rondo,"Kia followed the downsizing trend on the third generation of the Rondo and offered it on specific markets with smaller, fuel-efficient engines. The new generation replaced both the Sedona and the Rondo and showed a styling that matched the Kia lineup ""tiger-nose"" signature grille. While the MPV segment was shrinking, there were still enough buyers to convince a few carmakers to build a small or compact-sized MPV in a world dominated by crossovers and SUVs. At the front, the angular headlights swept back to the sides resembled the ones found on the Kia cee'd. The entire car looked like an oversized cee'd, with a taller greenhouse. That led to a steep hood that tried to connect to the raked windshield. The taillights showed a similar shape to those installed on the compact hatchback cee'd. But most people are buying seven-seat vehicles for their interiors. In that aspect, the Kia significantly improved the Carens. It offered plenty of headroom and legroom for the front and middle-row passengers. Five people could sit inside without any worries, but those two flat-folding seats in the back were too cramped to be used for more than a five-minute drive. One of the car's great improvements was the special storage bins with covers under the rear passenger's feet or under the trunk's floor. Under the hood, Kia offered the Rondo with a small engine range. While the Canadians could only choose the gasoline units, the Rondo was available for the Australian market with a turbo-diesel version as well.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Rondo"",  ""year"": ""third generation"",  ""size"": ""small or compact-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""angular"", ""tall"", ""oversized"", ""sleek"", ""compact""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [""tiger-nose"", ""signature""],    ""hood"": [""steep""],    ""headlights"": [""angular"", ""swept back""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA cee'd,"Part of the mid-sized family hatchback market, the first generation of Kia Ceed was released in 2006. Along the years, the Ceed was produced in over 1.3 million units and was one of Kia’s best selling models, reaching its 3rd generation in 2018. The Ceed was produced and designed in Europe, the 2018 model bringing a fresh design, with headlamps similar to the sporty Stinger and a refined back, a bit similar to the BMW 1 Series. The interior of the Ceed was nothing sophisticated, however, it provided comfort and utility. Passengers had more than enough headroom and legroom, with the exception of the middle seat in the back, which was mostly suitable for a short person due to the reduced legroom. Maybe in 2006 the Ceed was not to be compared with other already famous and desired cars like the VW’s Golf, but Kia evolved surprisingly fast and provided most of the latest features for a lower price than a Golf could. The Ceed had a 295 liters trunk and a 12v socket inside. It was offered with 5 engine variants, all of them meeting the euro 6 criteria. Even the standard version of the Ceed came with 6 airbags, 4 power windows, power and heated mirrors, an armrest, bluetooth, A/C as well as lane assist, autonomous emergency braking and a fatigue monitor. The safety features mentioned were to become compulsory and nevertheless provided a better crash test score. The multilink rear suspension was to be appreciated, as it offered more stability and coped very well with the road imperfections. The Ceed was designed to offer a pleasant daily drive, with upgraded technology and offered the already known 7 year warranty.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ceed"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""mid-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""fresh"", ""refined"", ""sporty"", ""sophisticated"", ""comfortable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""similar to BMW 1 Series""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""similar to sporty Stinger""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA cee'd SW,"Kia introduced the second generation of its compact hatchback cee'd model in March 2012 at the Geneva Motor Show in Europe, and next to it was the station wagon version of it, named Sportswagon. The Korean automaker continued its assault on the European market with the second generation of the cee'd. To make it even more appropriate for the Old Continent's customers, Kia designed it in Germany and produced it in Europe, in Slovakia. As a result, the vehicle came at a competitive price, even though it was more expensive than the model that it replaced. Following the new design language created by Peter Schreyer, the second generation of the cee'd Sportswagon featured a new front fascia that emphasized the “tiger-nose” look of the grille. The new headlights looked fresh and addressed the younger generation with their swept-back design. On the lower part of the bumper, the automaker installed a broad grille and the fog lamps, which were available as options. Furthermore, the two creases on the hood amplified the dynamic image of the car. From its profile, the ascending beltline of the Sportswagon continued behind the rear doors since the rear overhang was longer to accommodate the enlarged trunk area. Unusually, for an affordable vehicle, the station wagon didn't share its rear doors with the hatchback. In addition, Kia installed a third set of windows between the C- and the D-pillars. Furthermore, to confirm the “sports” from the Sportswagon nameplate, the automaker made a raked-forward tailgate that elegantly ended the vehicle. Just like its hatchback sibling, the Sportswagon featured a pair of bolstered front seats separated by a tall center console that housed an armrest, a storage compartment with a sliding cover, the gear stick, and the handbrake. One noticeable improvement over this version's previous generation was the materials' quality that surrounded the cabin. It didn't look like a cheap car anymore, even though it was still considered a budget vehicle. Since the car came in an era when most automakers started to install touchscreens for infotainment systems, Kia also added such a feat on the Sportswagon as an option. It filled the mid-section of the center stack between the vents and the HVAC control unit. Inside the instrument cluster, the automaker placed a TFT inside the center-mounted speedometer, which was flanked by the tachometer on the left and the fuel gauge and water temperature indicators on the right. In the back, the automaker installed a 60/40 split-folding bench seat that could expand the trunk space from 528 liters (18.6 cu-ft) to 1642 liters (58 cu-ft). Compared to its predecessor, the 2012 Sportswagon sat 40 mm (1.6”) lower, thus creating an even sportier image for the vehicle. It didn't look like a small LCV but a longer hot hatch. Still, the available engines didn't recommend it for fast travel. A 99 HP (101 PS) gasoline engine powered the entry level of the vehicle and sent its ponies to the front wheels. The most potent version of the Sportswagon was a 1.6-liter turbocharged gasoline powerplant that provided 133 HP (135 PS) to the wheels via either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic. Since Europeans loved diesel engines, Kia offered a choice of two oil burners mated with manual or automatic gearboxes.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""cee'd Sportswagon"",  ""year"": ""2012"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""dynamic"", ""elegant"", ""sporty"", ""fresh"", ""competitive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""tiger-nose"", ""broad""],    ""hood"": [""creased"", ""dynamic""],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back"", ""fresh""],    ""bumper"": [""broad""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""unusual"", ""separate""],    ""roof"": [""raked-forward""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA Borrego / Mohave,"Kia introduced the midsize Borrego as the 2009 model year and it had a truck type body-on-frame design. The Borrego wasn’t necessarily the type of car missing from the American market, however, it was an affordable SUV that met some of the features of a luxurious car. The truck type SUV was offered with V6 or V8 power and could accommodate up to 7 passengers with the 3 rows of seats available. The Borrego was fitted with a four-wheel-drive system to offer great off-road capabilities. However, the SUV was not decent at all when it came to the fuel consumption, it was a rather thirsty vehicle. Offering a solid and heavy feel, the Borrego acted like a regular truck SUV, much like the more expensive competitor, the Ford Explorer. Due to its high stance, the Borrego leaned in turns, however, it was not unstable. The ride quality was comfortable, however, compared to the competitors on the market, both of its available engines were a little underpowered. Inside, the high seating position made it very easy to see over traffic. The materials used were carefully assembled, however, hard plastics were used. Heavily marketed as luxurious, the Borrego lacked soft touch materials. The Borrego was vailable in three trim levels, the LX, EX and the Limited. The base trim level came with power accessories, an USB port, Aux jack and skidplates. The EX trim level added atuomatic climate control, power dont seats, automatic headlights and foglights. The more luxurious Limited trim level came with leather upholstery, heated seats, a rearview camera to enhance safety, power adjustable pedals and Bluetooth cellphone connectivity.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Borrego"",  ""year"": ""2009"",  ""size"": ""midsize"",  ""overall-design"": [""truck type body-on-frame design"", ""affordable SUV"", ""luxurious features"", ""solid and heavy feel"", ""high seating position""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""solid and heavy"", ""truck-like""],    ""headlights"": [""automatic"", ""foglights""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""power accessories"", ""leather upholstery""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA Stonic,"A new player in the compact crossover market, the Kia Stonic was a strong competitor to the Nissan Juke and the Renault Captur. The Kia Stonic was Kia’s smallest SUV, smaller than both the Sportage and the Sorento. The Stonic had the same mechanical underpinnings as the Kia Rio hatchback with which it shared its platform. Aesthetically, the attention was drawn by the Tiger nose grille that gave the Stonic a sporty look. The most interesting part was the targa-style body-coloured wraparound C-pillar, specific to the First Edition trim level available with a selection of contrasting roof colors. Inside, the cabin’s design matched the sporty feeling give by the exterior look. The cockpit was not overly flashy and controls were intuitively placed and easy to action. While the quality of the materials used was not the best, everything looked well put together. A variety of interior colors were available for further personalisation. Space wise, the Stonic easily accommodate 2 adults and a child in the rear seats. While the cargo area wasn’t the biggest in the class, with the rear seats folded flat, the cargo capacity increased considerably. A range of lightweight turbocharged gasoline and diesel were available, all of them paired with a manual transmission to maximise driver engagement. The lowest emission in the line-up were offered by the efficient 1.6-liter Diesel engine.

KIA EV5,"Kia launched an assault on the EV market and offered the EV5 as an alternative for the Sportage lineup, but with an electric motor under its skin. The Korean automaker introduced the EV5 at the Chengdu Motor Show in China. It made the vehicle based on the Kia EV6 platform, but unlike that model, the new crossover aimed at the families of the millennials. Not only was the exterior less aggressive than that of its sibling, but it also shared some ideas already seen on its bigger brother, the EV9. As a result, the EV5 was the electron-powered alternative for those looking for an EV version of the Sportage. Kia's design language went through a profound transformation. The automaker went to wedged shapes from the flowing lines of the Stinger and rounded shapes of the Rio and Ceed. It joined a new retro-design styling seen on other vehicles made by other brands. Still, many modern-looking details made the EV5 attractive to those who appreciated the tech era. As a result, the car's front featured a continuous line of LEDs that formed the daytime running lights. These flanked the sides of the vehicle and ran above the upper panel of the front fascia. In addition, at the lower side, the automaker installed a trapezoidal grille needed to cool the battery pack and the car's electronics. Still, EVs didn't need a wide cooling area such as ICE-powered vehicles. From its profile, the SUV looks sporting a cab-rearward shape featuring flat panels and subtle lines across the bodywork. In addition, at the rear, the design team created an upward line that connected the window line with the D-pillars. Finally, at the back, the automaker made upside-down U-shaped taillights resembling the front daytime running lights. Inside, the automaker installed a pair of seats at the front that looked more like a bench seat. Still, the center console didn't allow a third occupant to sit between the driver and the side passenger. The dashboard featured a minimalist design with horizontal lines and a wide and curved display on top of it. Fronting the driver was a digital instrument panel that shared the same glass panel with the infotainment's touchscreen. But Kia understood that customers still wanted physical buttons, so it left the main one in place. Furthermore, there were several other buttons on the steering wheel that controlled the sound system, onboard computer, and telephone functions. In the back, on the split-folding (60/40) bench seat, the automaker made room for three additional passengers. The flat folding bench could expand the trunk's space. Just like its siblings, the EV6 and the EV9, the EV5 featured a battery pack installed inside the floor that sent its electrons to the car's motors. Kia offered the vehicle with either a two or an all-wheel-drive system. The EV5 used an iron phosphate battery pack made by the Chinese tech company BYD. These were heavier than those using the lithium-ion technology but offered a recycling advantage.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""EV5"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""compact crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""wedged shapes"", ""retro-design styling"", ""modern-looking details"", ""minimalist design"", ""flat panels""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""angled""],    ""grille"": [""trapezoidal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""continuous line of LEDs""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""sporting""],    ""doors"": [""flat panels"", ""subtle lines""],    ""roof"": [""cab-rearward shape""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""upward line""]  }}```"
KIA EV6,"Kia opened a new chapter in its design philosophy when it unveiled its new EV6 model in 2021, a crossover that distanced itself from the ""tiger-nose"" aesthetic concept. Karim Habib was head of design for BMW, Mercedes-Benz, back to BMW and then went for Infiniti before joining the Hyundai-Kia. The Lebanese-Canadian designer was responsible for more success stories in car design and took the Kia to a different level with the introduction of the EV6. Kia's Head of Global Design Center named its new design concept as ""Opposites United,"" combining older elements with futuristic lines. At the front, the pinched grille that formed the tiger-nose concept imagined by Petter Schreyer was abandoned. Habib spread a narrow opening between the headlights, stuck between the hood and the bumper. He designed a broader grille at the bottom to help to cool the batteries and the electrical system. From the sides, the EV6 shown its crossover design style with a tall beltline that was curved upwards in a kick behind the rear doors. Its sloped windscreen and vertical rear panel resembled the Kamm-back design from the '70s. Inside, the designer continued its concept. While the middle and lower part of the dashboard was part of the old school, with haptic buttons and manually adjustable vents, the upper side featured a sloped clean area and a curved ultra-widescreen for the instrument panel and the infotainment touch-screen. Since the car was built on the new Electric-Global Modular Platform (E-GMP), the EV6 showed Kia's desire to mark its presence on the world electric vehicle market. It surely got everyone's attention.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""EV6"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""futuristic"", ""curved"", ""sloped"", ""clean"", ""wide""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""pinched"", ""narrow"", ""broader""],    ""hood"": [""curved""],    ""headlights"": [""narrow""],    ""bumper"": [""bottom grille""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""rear kick""],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA EV9,"Kia unveiled the EV9 SUV in the Spring of 2023, thus shocking its competitors with the seven-seat vehicle and the MPV-like interior versatility. The Korean automaker was no longer that automaker that built econoboxes with cheap interiors and bland designs. After it started to invest more in its design department, and with the help from its parent company, Hyundai, it became a very attractive automaker, especially thanks to its electric vehicles. As a result, after launching the EV6, it dared more and created the EV9 as an alternative for minivans and crossovers alike. At first sight, the car's proportions resembled the ones from the Soul. Despite the fact that it was an electric vehicle, it sported a conventional look with an engine compartment installed at the front. The front fascia's design sported vertical, angular-shaped slim daytime running lights that flanked the outer sides of the LED headlights. There was no main grille since that wasn't needed, but just a flat panel that sported a slim black upper trim and a lower gap above the bumper. Still, the electronics needed some cooling, so the carmaker installed a lower grille in the apron. From its profile, the angular shapes of the bodywork were emphasized by the flared wheel arches, trying to mimic the ruggedness of an offroader. Kia installed a minimalist interior with a flat dashboard where it placed two 12.3"" displays, one for the instrument panel and the other for the infotainment system. The latter was also a touchscreen. Still, there were some physical buttons installed for the HVAC unit. Apart from the front bucket seats, the automaker placed a pair of captain seats on the second row, which could revolve into a rearward-facing position, so their occupants sit face to face with those seated on the third row.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""EV9 SUV"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""seven-seat"",  ""overall-design"": [""attractive"", ""conventional"", ""rugged"", ""minimalist"", ""versatile""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""conventional""],    ""grille"": [""flat"", ""slim"", ""black""],    ""hood"": [""conventional""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""slim""],    ""bumper"": [""lower""],    ""wheel"": [""flared""],    ""doors"": [""minimalist""],    ""roof"": [""flat""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA Cerato/Forte,"The 2013 Kia Forte was right between the small Kia Rio and the midsize sedan Kia Optima, which made it a good affair for a family. It had plenty of features to offer. Kia made a name of itself by offering decent prices for decent vehicles. They might not have the best materials in the industry or the latest technology inside, but they are built to last on low running costs. The exterior design for the 2013 Kia Forte was inspired by the European styling concepts for the four-door sedan and the 5-door hatchback. When compared to its previous generation, the 2014 Kia Forte was bolder, roomier and better equipped. It had the European influenced design with longer headlights. The two trim levels available offered enough features for a family and in the rear, thanks to its bigger wheelbase, had room for three people. The rear taillights were offered as an option with LED. The infotainment unit had a large screen and a rear-view camera. In the instrument cluster, there was a 4.2"" TFT screen offered as an option. Like other Kia models, the Forte joined the trend with the electric power steering instead of the hydraulic type. For the base model, with the 1.8-liter, a 6-speed manual was fitted as standard and an optional 6-speed automatic was available. The 2.0-liter engine, in the EX trim level, was mated to a 6-speed automatic only.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Kia Forte"",  ""year"": ""2013"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""European-inspired"", ""bolder"", ""roomier"", ""longer headlights"", ""bigger wheelbase""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""longer""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""bigger""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA Picanto X-Line,"Kia knew that customers were eager to get themselves behind the wheel of a crossover or SUV, and since it didn't have anything to offer in the small-sized segment, it created the X-Line for the Picanto lineup. The world had enough station wagons and minivans, and customers started to appreciate more vehicles with higher ground clearance and a rugged appearance. Thus, the SUV market gained a lot of traction all over the world. At the same time, Kia already had a few successful models, such as the Seltos, the Sportage, or the Sorento, but nothing that appealing in the small segment. Yet, it already produced the Picanto lineup. So, all it had to do was to work a little on the car's chassis and its bodywork, thus creating the X-Line. The new attitude was obtained by raising the ground clearance of a regular Picanto by just 15 millimeters (0.6""). In addition, the small vehicle received a body kit that mimicked an off-road vehicle. At the front, the bumper was enhanced with contrasting colored fog light clusters and an aluminum-looking underbody shield. In addition, the unique alloy wheels designed especially for the Picanto X-Line showed a tougher appearance. Inside, the automaker offered a similar interior as in the rest of the Picanto range, although it enhanced it with a few contrasting details on the door cards. A few bright gray trims adorned the vents and the center console around the gear stick. Yet, since the base vehicle was still the small-sized Picanto, it didn't provide any additional legroom or headroom. Under the hood, Kia installed its new inline-three turbocharged gasoline engine. It paired it with a five-speed manual that sent the power to the front wheels and called it a day.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Picanto X-Line"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""small-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""off-road-inspired"", ""compact"", ""tough"", ""contrasting""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""enhanced""],    ""headlights"": [""contrasting-colored""],    ""bumper"": [""enhanced"", ""contrasting-colored""],    ""wheel"": [""unique"", ""tough-looking"", ""alloy""],    ""doors"": [""contrasting-detailed""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA Stonic GT-Line,"A slight refresh for the Stonic shows that the small crossover Kia can be a faster-looking vehicle, even though it was not designed as a fast car. The crossover mania covered all the segments, filling the gaps left by station-wagons and minivans on the market when those were not requested by the customers anymore. Stonic was based on the small-class vehicle platform used in Rio, and it gathered attention with its design and its seven-year warranty. The GT-Line version shows a sportier design with the specific front grille, LED headlights, and daytime running lights. A more dynamic front and rear bumper with integrated skid-plates increased the car's image. A set of 17"" light-alloy wheels was installed exclusively on the GT-line. Inside, the D-letter steering wheel, with a flat bottom, enhanced the driving experience. For the new, 8"" touch-screen infotainment system dominated the dashboard. The instrument cluster featured an additional 4.2"" color display for the on-board computer. As for the safety systems, the Stonic GT-Line received a complete package that included the lane-keep assist, driver attention warning, and high-beam assist. For the engine, Kia introduced a new 1.0-liter powerplant that offered 118 hp. On top of the turbocharged and direct fuel-injection system, the unit received a Continuously Variable Valve Duration, which allowed a better mix-ration to fill the cylinders and offer a better fuel-efficiency.",KIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Stonic"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""small crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""faster-looking"", ""sporty"", ""dynamic"", ""enhanced"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""specific"", ""front""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""front"", ""rear"", ""integrated"", ""skid-plates""],    ""wheel"": [""17-inch"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KIA K5,"Kia K5 Fastback combined a striking new design of Kia's global best-selling sedan with all-new powertrain options, resulting in a sporty and svelte silhouette with smart stream gasoline engines, new transmissions, and a new AWD system. For the first time on Kia's D-segment sedan, K5 fastback comes with a new all-wheel-drive system. The K5 is available with a choice of gasoline engines and a wide range of technologies and features, making it safer and less stressful. Some of the features that can be controlled through K5's voice recognition software are climate change control, electric windows, heating for the steering wheel, seats and rear glass. In regards to the safety, there are a wide range of passive and active safety driver assist systems and some available features (depending on the market and the car's specifications) that are designed to protect its passengers in every journey, such as Forward Collision-avoidance Assist (FCA), Blind-spot View Monitor (BVM) with Surround View Monitor (SVM) and Blind-spot Collision-avoid Assist (BCA), Smart Cruise Control (SCC) or Navigation-based SCC (NSCC), Lane Following Assist (LFA), Driver Attention Warning (DAW), and Highway Driving Assist (HDA).

KIA pro_cee’d GT,"While some car-makers chose to remove the rear doors and rename their new versions as a “coupe”, Kia took a different path. It chose the cee'd platform and installed a new bodywork on it, even if it was costlier. But the result was very good. The pro_cee'd was the sportier version of the cee'd. It was lower and featured a different bumper design. In the front, on the GT trim-level, the fog-lights were four LEDs on each side and a wide grille in the middle. The upper grille featured a honeycomb design. The raked A-pillars and the sloped roof offered a dynamic image. On the side, the sculptured doors looked better than the plain, curved ones, found on the 5-door version. In the back, a two exhaust system was installed for the sportier versions. Inside, there were few things carried over from the regular cee'd. It used the same dash as the normal cee'd. The center stack was the place where the interior designers decided to install the infotainment unit, with a 7” touch-screen. For the front seats, the pro_cee'd was offered with a pair of Recaro sport bucket seats. In the back, there was enough room for two adult passengers with a decent amount of legroom and headroom, despite the sloped roof. Under the hood, the pro_cee'd was offered with a 1.6-liter turbocharged gasoline engine, which featured direct injection. It was mated to a standard 6-speed manual gearbox.

KOENIGSEGG Gemera,"The ultimate four-seat hypercar from one of the most exotic European car-specialist was unveiled at the 2020 Geneva Motor Show. Even though the car show itself was canceled, Christian von Koenigsegg showcased the Gemera online from the event's premises. It is the most radical vehicle built by the small Swedish company to date. Nobody could expect a 2.0-liter, three-cylinder engine to produce 600 hp. And yet, the Gemera has one. And it is  a revolutionary one, without valves. It doesn't run on gasoline but on methane. It is also aided by three electric motors. The total power output for this assembly is 1700 hp. The technology doesn't stop here, though. The all-wheel-drive, all-wheel-steering and all-wheel-vectoring hypercar can go up to 300 kph only in electric mode. The electric-only range is 50 km (31 miles). The interior is as surprising as the exterior. It has no less than eight cupholders (one for cold and one for hot beverages). It is something that not even your minivan offers and the Gemera has it. It also has two huge doors that are opened upwards so the rear passengers could just climb in, without moving the front seats forward. And, the most surprising fact is that the Gemera is the first hypercar with four real seats on the planet. And, maybe, the next one will be also a Koenigsegg. This is the only brand who doesn't ask anyone's approval to build a new crazy, exclusive, vehicle. Only 300 units will be built.",KOENIGSEGG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Gemera"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""four-seat hypercar"",  ""overall-design"": [""radical"", ""revolutionary"", ""exclusive"", ""surprising"", ""crazy""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""huge"", ""revolutionary""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""huge"", ""upward-opening"", ""four real seats""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
KOENIGSEGG Jesko,"Named in the honor of Christian von Koenigsegg's father, Jesko von Koenigsegg, this is the most outrageous supercar made in Sweden. In 2019, at the Geneva Motor Show, the vehicle vas unveiled by the parents of the supercar founder. Only 125 vehicles will be produced, between 40 to 50 cars per year. The 5.0-liter engine is the key-element of this supercar. It is an unusual twin-turbo V8 with a 180 degrees crankshaft. Due to this, engineers were able to increase the maximum speed limit to 8.500 rpm. This is one of the highest revving V8 engines in the world. The engine is mostly manufactured by hand within a special steel-shop from Sweden. The result is a remarkable 1280 hp on regular gasoline and 1600 hp on E85. Maximum torque is 1500 Nm (1106 lb-ft), but over 60% of it is available between 2700 to 6170  rpm. Another special characteristic of the Jesko is the gearbox. It is developed and built in house and features 9 speeds without resorting to a dual-clutch system. Christian von Koenigsegg considered that the double-clutch gearboxes are too heavy. The LST (Light Speed Transmission) is 30% lighter then a regular DCT transmission. It is claimed that, on E85 fuel, the Jesko may exceed a 300 mph (483 kph) top speed.",KOENIGSEGG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Jesko"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""outrageous"", ""super""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""twin-turbo""]  }}```"
KOENIGSEGG Regera,"Koenigsegg introduced the Regera on the market in 2015, threatening most supercar makers with a hybrid go-fast vehicle that was also able to run exclusively on electrons. The company owner, Christian von Koenigsegg, didn't like the idea of the way hybrid vehicles were made. So, he thought that he might use the instant torque provided by electric motors to boost the performance of his cars. In addition, it added a charging port to the Regera, so the result was an astonishing fast plug-in hybrid. It was the car that the car manufacturer tried to oppose the all-mighty Bugatti Veyron. And the result exceeded customers' expectations. At the front, the car manufacturer introduced LEDs for the daytime running lights arranged so they resembled a constellation. In addition, the short nose and the broad lower bumper that featured an air intake, a splitter, and a pair of side scoops created an aggressive look for the Regera. Like the rest of the vehicles made by Koenigsegg, the car featured a steep panoramic windshield followed by a greenhouse that resembled a fighter jet cockpit. Unlike its stablemates, on this one, the rear end was elongated in its sloped-down shape. Finally, at the back, the Regera featured a massive diffuser underneath the bumper and a center-mounted oval exhaust. Above it, the automaker placed the Type 2 Mode 3 charging port. But no hypercar would've been able to compete without a stunning-looking interior, and Christian von Koenigsegg knew that. As a result, the carmaker's team didn't take any shortcuts and burned the midnight oil to create an exclusive, lavish cabin for the Regera. The handcrafted cabin featured a digital instrument cluster placed in front of the driver. In addition, the automaker installed an additional screen on the center stack for the infotainment system. It featured Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. To create an even better environment inside, Koenigsegg installed a set of high-bolstered bucket seats that kept their occupants safe during high-speed cornering maneuvers. But the real marvel happened underneath the car's skin. The Swedish car manufacturer installed a dry-sump 5.0-liter V8, helped by two turbochargers. In addition, the three electric motors added more oomph to the system for a total output of 1500 HP (1510 PS). Thanks to this setup, the Regera proved in independent tests to achieve a 0-60 MPH (0-97 kph) sprint in 1.9 seconds and a top speed of 248 MPH (400 kph), confirming the carmaker's statements. But Koenigsegg went even further with its developments and allowed the PHEV Regera to run on electrons alone. So, the automaker installed a 620 Volts battery inside the carbon-aramid chassis tunnel that could store up to 9.27 kWh of energy. In full acceleration mode, it sent 500 kW to the electric motors. At the same time, during the regenerative braking process, it could gain up to 150 kW.",KOENIGSEGG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Regera"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""exclusive"", ""lavish"", ""fast"", ""stunning""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""steep"", ""panoramic""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""short"", ""broad""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""arranged"", ""constellation""],    ""bumper"": [""lower"", ""air intake"", ""splitter"", ""side scoops"", ""aggressive""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloped-down""],    ""diffusor"": [""massive""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""center-mounted"", ""oval""]  }}```"
KTM X-Bow,"The Austrian motorcycle builder KTM launched the X-Bow in 2008 as a track-weapon, feather-light two-seat roadster, and five years later, it made it better for road use. KTM X-Bow was already notorious among race-car lovers. Its Dallara-designed, carbon-fiber roadster proved to be very fast despite its only 300 hp engine. The secret stood in the vehicle's weight, which was reduced to a ridiculous 790 kg (1740 lbs). But the driver and its passenger had to wear a helmet and a jumpsuit since there was no windscreen nor roof above the cabin. The Austrian motorcycle manufacturer made an important upgrade for the roadster in 2013 when it decided to install a windshield and side windows but no roof. The X-Bow GT was just 57 kg (125 lbs) heavier than the original X-Bow. KTM included a mandatory windshield wiper. Since the GT version was designed for Gran Tourismo travels, KTM introduced a set of, specially tailored handbags. Also, there were a few comfort features, such as a heating and ventilation system with controls installed on the center console. Moreover, the Austrian engineers considered installing an illuminated footwell. From inside, the three glass panels inspired a helmet-view for its occupants. Under the hood, KTM installed the same 2.0-liter engine carried-over from Volkswagen GTI, tuned to produced 300 hp.

LADA Kalina Sedan,"The Russian carmaker tried to refresh its lineup and introduced the Kalina model in 2006 as a replacement for the already old Lada 110. After the fall of the communist regime in the U.S.S.R., things didn't go so well for the Togliatti factory. But slowly and surely, it started to get up on its feet and launched the 110 in 1996 and the Kalina in 2006. It was a small-segment vehicle aimed against the Dacia/Renault Logan and Hyundai Accent. The exterior looked like there were a few design teams, and they didn't talk one to another. The result was a rounded shape with headlights that looked from a different vehicle while the trunk was added after the rest of the car was ready. And that's not too far from the truth since the Kalina sedan was unveiled after the Kalina hatchback. The small window behind the rear doors resembled the one fitted on the Opel Vectra B, and the taillights looked close to those from the Opel/Vauxhall Astra sedan. Inside, the designers installed the headlights controls on the steering wheel's left, inspired by some German cars. Unlike those, the Kalina dashboard featured seven air-vents, apart from the windshield defroster. The Russian engineers definitely knew how the winters are looking over there. Under the hood, Lada installed one engine option, carried over from the Lada 110 lineup. It was a four-pot 1.6-liter engine that offered 80 hp. It was paired to a standard 5-speed gearbox.

LADA Niva,"At the beginning of the '70s, the Soviet Union premier Alexei Kosygin assigned AvtoVaz and AZLK to create an off-road vehicle, and competition between the two Russian carmakers began. The Communist party understood the need for an off-road vehicle, ideal for rough remote areas where roads existed only on lines on some maps. The older GAZ off-road vehicle, built since WWII, was outdated, very uncomfortable, and unreliable. AvtoVaz, who were already producing Lada cars under Fiat's license, won the competition and started building the Niva in 1976. It was a simple-looking, two-door vehicle. Unlike most other 4x4 cars on the market, it featured a unit-body construction and coil springs in all corners. At the front, it sported two round headlights and a black plastic grille. Unusually for those times, it featured the parking lights and the turn signals above the headlamps. The wrapped-around bumper was metallic on the center section and with plastic ends. At the back, the carmaker installed a liftgate with a very high loading area. Inside, it was just as rugged and simple as it looked on the outside. There were two seats at the front and a bench in the back advertised for three, but with minimal legroom and headroom. Its dashboard was black and simple. It looked like AvtoVaz carried it over from a soviet military vehicle with rugged buttons. The carmaker installed the gear-stick and two transmission levers on the floor between the two occupants to engage the low-range and lock the center differential. AvtoVaz installed a 1.6-liter gasoline engine under the hood and paired it with a four-speed manual gearbox. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the carmaker upgraded the drivetrain. It installed a 1.7-liter fuel injected engine, and later on, an option for a diesel carried over from Peugeot-Citroen.",LADA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Niva"",  ""year"": ""1976"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""simple"", ""utilitarian""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black"", ""plastic""],    ""hood"": [""simple""],    ""headlights"": [""round""],    ""bumper"": [""metallic"", ""wrapped-around""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""two-door""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LAMBORGHINI Huracan Spyder,"Unveiled at almost the same time as its fixed-roof coupe brother, the Lamborghini Huracan Evo Spider is the second-fastest V10-powered open-top in Lamborghini history, second only to the Performante Spider. Just like the Huracan Evo, the Evo Spider has a front/rear weight distribution of 40/60 and sits on a double wishbone suspension with overlapped quadrilaterals and passive shock absorbers. That being said, the electro-mechanical, servo-assisted Lamborghini Dynamic Steering (LDS) has been tuned specifically for the model and the engine has a bit more weight to carry because of the reinforcements to the chassis. The open-top supercar is powered by a naturally aspirated 5.2-liter V10 delivering 640 hp (470 kW) of power at 8,000 rpm and 600 Nm of torque at 6,500 rpm, more than enough for a Lambo that can be experienced with no roof. The fast-revving ten-cylinder engine is paired with a seven-speed dual clutch gearbox that ensures lightning-fast gear changes. With launch control, the quickest acceleration to 100 kph (62 mph) from a standing start is done in no more than 3.1 seconds. Top speed is also a more than decent 325 kph. The Lamborghini Huracan Evo Spider comes as standard with 20-inch Aesir wheels engulfed in specially-developed Pirelli P Zero tires. Stopping power is more than enough since the car is fitted with ventilated and cross-drilled brakes. The soft top can be opened in just 17 seconds and up to a driving speed of 50 kph (31 mph).",LAMBORGHINI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Lamborghini Huracan Evo Spider"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""20-inch Aesir wheels"", ""specially-developed Pirelli P Zero tires""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""soft top""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LAMBORGHINI Huracan,"Lamborghini unveiled the most unusual version of the Hurracan in late 2022, the Sterrato, as a rally-oriented supercar, which sounded like a contradiction. The Italian supercar manufacturer wasn't involved in off-road, gravel, or any kind of rally races. Its connection with unpaved roads was limited to the older LM002 and the Urus. And then, in 2022, it showcased the Sterrato. It was like nothing else. Lamborghini created a mix between a supercar and a Group-B rally car. While the bodywork looked unmistakably similar to a Hurracan, the details told something else. The ground clearance was raised by 44 mm compared to the Hurracan EVO, and the track was wider on both axles. In addition, the front aluminum underbody protection, the reinforced side sills, and the sturdy wheel arches emphasized the car's muscular look. On the roof, besides the functional air intake, Lamborghini also installed roof rails. And if that was unusual for a Lamborghini supercar, then the automaker doubled down with a set of LED fog lamps flanking the car's badge at the front. Inside, the rugged appearance of the cabin was softened by the carbon-fiber sports seats wrapped in green leather. There were a few red accents for the door handles, the starter button, and the steering wheel. The infotainment system was on the center stack like on any other Hurracan, but it featured additional, rally-specific settings. Behind the cabin, in the engine compartment, Lamborghini installed the same 5.2-liter V10 powerplant that sent its power in all corners via a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox. It was tuned for rally use, for gravel roads.",LAMBORGHINI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Hurracan Sterrato"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""muscular"",  ""overall-design"": [""unusual"", ""rally-oriented"", ""muscular"", ""functional"", ""rugged""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""raised""],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""wider track""],    ""doors"": [""carbon-fiber"", ""green leather"", ""red accents""],    ""roof"": [""functional air intake"", ""roof rails""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LAMBORGHINI Aventador,"It was the last Aventador, the car that should end the 11 years career of the Italian supercar career after many other special editions. Moreover, it was the final Lamborghini fitted with a naturally aspirated V12 engine. As time went by, Lamborghini adopted the strategy of creating special models, which were sold with a lot more money than the regular versions. Although, sometimes, these special editions were not as special as the vehicles they derived from. The Ultimae received a redesigned front bumper that increased the downforce. In addition, a splitter and an open air intake optimized the aerodynamics. On the sides, the Ultimae sported the same angular-shaped air intakes for the engine, placed behind the doors but adorned with unique decals. At the back, a three-position active aerodynamic wing kept the car planted on the road at high speeds and at high-speed cornering maneuvers. Inside, the cockpit resembled the same fighter-jet-inspired atmosphere, with sport bucket seats deeply sculptured with a Y-pattern on the leather upholstery. The contrast stitching made that even more obvious. At the same time, the Lamborghini logos on the headrests completed the unique image of the Ultimae. The Ultimae features a V12 engine behind the cabin like any other Aventador. But, unlike the rest of the range, it offered 780 PS (770 hp) at a sky-high rev range. It was still mated to the same seven-speed (dual-clutch) automatic gearbox and sends the power in all corners. While it's not way faster than the Aventador S, the Ultimae was lighter and nimbler on the race track than its sibling.",LAMBORGHINI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Aventador"",  ""year"": ""Ultimae"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""angular"", ""aerodynamic"", ""sculptured"", ""unique"", ""fighter-jet-inspired""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""redesigned"", ""increased downforce""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""redesigned"", ""increased downforce"", ""angular""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""angular-shaped air intakes"", ""adorned with unique decals""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""three-position active aerodynamic wing""],    ""exhaust"": [""V12 engine behind the cabin""]  }}```"
LAMBORGHINI Aventador Roadster,"It was the last roadster built by Lamborghini with the marvelous, naturally aspirated V12 engine behind the cabin, and it offered the thrills its customers asked for. As the world started to shift toward electric-powered vehicles, some carmakers tried to keep the old-fashioned gasoline-only powered supercars on the assembly lines. One of them was Lamborghini, who released a last special edition of the 11-year-old Aventador, and it was named Ultimae Roadster. No, there is no spelling mistake there; Ultimae is the Italian word for, you guessed it, ultimate. While it wasn't a completely new car, the Ultimae roadster shared many of its parts with the open-top Aventador but sported a few unique details. For instance, the front bumper featured a wider air intake that increased the downforce on the front axle. Moreover, the carmaker adorned the side air intake with unique details that made the bystanders understand that it is the ultimate Aventador in terms of performance. At the back, the three-position wing increased the downforce and helped the car stay planted to the road. The cabin sported a similar environment to its coupe sibling. The Y-shaped pattern on the seat's upholstery emphasized the car's sports character. On the other hand, unlike the coupe, the roadster didn't offer the same contrast lines on the seatbacks, only the contrast stitching. Featuring the same naturally aspirated V12 engine as the Aventador Ultimae, the Roadster version was 50 kg (110 lbs) heavier than its sibling. Still, that didn't really affect the car's performance. It just added more excitement to its driver.",LAMBORGHINI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Aventador Ultimae Roadster"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""marvelous"", ""ultimate"", ""unique"", ""exciting"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""wider air intake""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""wider air intake"", ""increased downforce""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""three-position wing"", ""increased downforce""],    ""exhaust"": [],  }}```"
LAMBORGHINI Sian,"The first Lamborghini hybrid was revealed in September 2019. The Y-shapes and the aggressive look were matched only by its rumored staggering price of 3.6 million Euro. The supercar is a homage to the former Volkswagen chairman, Ferdinand Piech, with the 37 in the name representing his birth year. Its design incorporates the theme of Marcello Gandini's signature wedge shape and hexagonal rear taillights. On the rear fenders, a pair of carbon fiber fins are embossed with the number 63, which is the year when Lamborghini was founded. The power comes from the Aventador's SVJ engine but upgraded and aided by an electric motor incorporated into the 7-speed semi-automatic gearbox. But the most interesting feature of the new Sian is that it doesn't store the energy into regular batteries but in ultra-capacitors. These can discharge fast and improve acceleration time in a split of a second. The combination of the 6.5 liter V12 engine plus the 48-volt electric motor results into a total of 807 hp, which leads to a 0-100 kph (0-62 mph) acceleration time of 2.8 seconds and a top speed of 350 kph (217 mph). The whole car is an homage to the Volkswagen group, which helped Lamborghini rise again from its ashes. Last but not least, FKP are the initials of Ferdinand Karl Piech, the man behind the decision to take over Lamborghini and Ferdinand Porsche's nephew.",LAMBORGHINI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Sian"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""hexagonal"", ""carbon fiber"", ""wedge shape"", ""homage""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""hexagonal"", ""carbon fiber""]  }}```"
LAMBORGHINI Urus,"Lamborghini had a long history of producing Performante versions for its supercars, but in 2022 it carried over that technology to its crossover Urus. When the Italian carmaker introduced the Urus, the world was stunned. While it wasn't the first high-rider in its history, it was the first designed to storm the high-performance crossover market. When that was not enough for its customers, Lamborghini introduced an even fiercer version: the Performante. Lamborghini's Performante vehicles sported modified exteriors when compared to their regular siblings, and so was the Urus. It featured a new, sharper-looking front bumper with distinctive side scoops and a trapezoidal-shaped lower air intake. The hood featured a black center area to reveal the carbon-fiber material used to make it. From its profile, the Urus Performante showed a lowered ground clearance by 20 mm (0.8"") due to the new steel suspension. At the back, the spoiler sports carbon-fiber fins resembling those installed on the Aventador SVJ. The cockpit's interior features Nero Cosmus black Alcantara as standard, along with the ""Performante trim,"" a new hexagonal seat stitching pattern, and other choices, including leather upholstery. In addition, Ad Personam customization choices include matte carbon fiber accents, red door handles, and a personalized kickplate with the Ad Personam emblem. Both the inside aluminum trim and the black Alcantara/leather steering wheel are finished in matte black. The same finish can be extended to other interior features with the optional ""Dark Package,"" including the lever on the Urus's central ""TAMBURO,"" which houses controls like the start/stop button and drive mode selector. On the Performante version, the twin-turbo V8 engine from the Urus gained just 16 hp, which, combined with the lowered weight by 50 kg (110 lbs), led to a lower 0-62 mph (0-100 kph) time, but the same top speed.",LAMBORGHINI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Urus"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""sharp"", ""fierce"", ""distinctive"", ""lowered"", ""customizable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""distinctive""],    ""hood"": [""black"", ""carbon-fiber""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""new"", ""sharper-looking"", ""distinctive"", ""trapezoidal-shaped""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""customizable"", ""red""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""carbon-fiber"", ""fins""],    ""exhaust"": [""twin-turbo"", ""lowered weight""]  }}```"
LAMBORGHINI Centenario Roadster,"2016 marked 100 years since the birth of Ferrucio Lamborghini. To mark the milestone, Lamborghini built the Centenario supercar, to honor the brand's founder. Only 40 vehicles were made, from which 20 were roadsters. They shared the same platform but with the modifications needed accordingly to the bodywork type. The design team received a green-light from Stephen Winkelmann, President and CEO of Lamborghini to create a unique bodywork. The result is so weird that it looks like a sort of stealth fighter with very short wings. The aerodynamic is extreme in this car, but everything is built for a purpose. The huge front splitter with air-intakes is channeling the air over the windshield and on sides. The side-boards are canceling the ground-effect. Underbody protection ensures laminar airflow. The rear splitter has the role to direct the air from underneath the car and deflect-it seamlessly to the back. The big electronically controlled wing creates massive downforce when extended. 180% more than when it is retracted. The Centenario Roadster features an all-wheel-steering system, a Lamborghini first! The all-wheel-drive supercar steers in the opposite direction to the front wheels at speeds under 60 kph (45 mph) and in the same direction up to 3 degrees. Above 45 mph, the rear wheels turn in phase with the front wheels by 1.5 degrees A 7-speed automated single-clutch gearbox is mounted on the vehicle. The driver also can change the gears manually, via two big carbon-fiber paddle shifters behind the steering wheel.",LAMBORGHINI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Centenario"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""extreme aerodynamic"", ""unique bodywork"", ""stealth fighter inspiration""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""short""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""huge front splitter""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""rear splitter""],    ""spoiler"": [""big electronically controlled wing""],    ""exhaust"": [""N/A""]  }}```"
LAMBORGHINI Sian Roadster,"The Sian Roadster enhanced the experience of a hybrid supercar with the pleasure of open-top driving. It was based on the 2019 Lamborghini Sian FKP37. When Lamborghini unveiled the Sian FKP37 coupe, it was a tribute for Ferdinand Piech, the Volkswagen group manager who made possible the Italian brand's acquisition. But that was in 2019. In 2020, Lamborghini unveiled the Roadster version in an online event due to the world pandemic. The Y-shaped daytime running lights at the front was an extension for the carbon-fiber front splitters. The designers combined the flat and angular surfaces with the curved shape of the fenders. The Countach was their inspiration, and that could have been noticed in the back as well. Six hexagonal taillights ensured the rear visibility of the supercar. The aerodynamic engineers installed a special retractable wing in the back, ended in two fixed winglets. The car's interior was Lamborghini's interpretation of luxury. The car-maker installed a different kind of leather on the slim, carbon-fiber seats. The door panels featured an aluminum handle and a carbon-fiber trim. All of the interior colors could have been custom made to suit the customer's taste. The powertrain was a mix between a 6.5-liter V12 engine and a 48-volt electric motor offering a total of 807 hp, which leads to a 0-100 kph (0-62 mph) acceleration time of 2.8 seconds and a top speed of 350 kph (217 mph).

LAMBORGHINI Revuelto,"Lamborghini sent the Aventador to retirement in the Fall of 2022, after 11 years on the market and more than 11,000 units produced and made way for the 2023 Revuelto in its lineup. The Italian supercar manufacturer embraced the electrification era and introduced the Revuelto as its most powerful vehicle ever made to that date. Thus, the competition between the angry bull from Sant'Agata Bolognese and the prancing horse from Modena moved on into a new territory, where the brands had to fight for dominance not just with clever, gasoline-powered units but also with electrons, batteries, and electric motors. The Revuelto's look had a little bit of everything. The front fascia featured the three LED strips for the daytime running lights placed on each side of the front fascia. Its lower bumper sported two massive scoops on the sides that flanked a center-mounted lower grille, needed not just for creating downforce but also to cool the battery pack. Since the car got its engine mounted in the middle, the cabin was moved forward, thus creating a similar shape to the one from the Sian. In addition, at the back, the Revuelto featured two high-mounted exhausts. Inside, the manufacturer placed a set of bucket seats and a tall center console between them, which hosted the start button and the gearbox's buttons. Apart from the vertical, center-mounted touchscreen, Lamborghini also placed a digital TFT display in the instrument cluster, accompanied by a portrait-mode touchscreen mounted atop the center stack. In addition, a third TFT stood in front of the side passenger. But the most important news was related to the engine, which featured a similar displacement as the one fitted in the Aventador. Still, the V12 didn't work alone to propel the car. It was helped by two electric motors at the front, driving the wheels, and an additional one that moved the rear wheels only.",LAMBORGHINI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Revuelto"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""mid-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""electric"", ""modern"", ""aerodynamic"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""center-mounted"", ""massive"", ""lower""],    ""hood"": [""similar shape to Sian""],    ""headlights"": [""three LED strips"", ""daytime running lights""],    ""bumper"": [""lower"", ""sporty"", ""functional""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""bucket seats"", ""tall center console""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""high-mounted""]  }}```"
LAMBORGHINI Veneno Roadster,"The Veneno was one of the rarest Lamborghini ever made. There were only three coupes and nine roadsters and despite being three times more roadsters, they were much more expensive. When the Italians built the Veneno (means venom), they didn't just rebadge another model and put some weird strips on it. They went all the way of designing one of the most aggressive looking cars ever made. It had a Predator mixed with Terminator look, and the roadster added a space-ship ingredient in the mix. The Veneno roadster featured a wedge-style look, with aerodynamic fins outside the front fenders, on the bottom of the front spoiler. The wheel-arches were rounded hexagonal shape for the front and squares in the back. The raked windshield was continued on its sides by the door windows, which were cut to visually link the A-pillars to the engine compartment. Behind the cockpit, there was an air-intake inside a long central fin. A feature that was seen only on endurance racing cars. A big wing in the back and a massive diffuser under the bumper completed the image. The entire bodywork was made out of CFRP. Inside, the Veneno featured sport bucket-seats and a digital instrument cluster. The low mounted center console hosted the buttons for the gearbox and the start, which was under a red cap. The bucket-seats were made out of Forged Composite materials. The Veneno roadster shared its platform with the Veneno and the Aventador. It featured a 6.5-liter V12 capable of 750 hp. It was mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox and it was all-wheel-drive.",LAMBORGHINI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Veneno"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""predator"", ""terminator"", ""space-ship"", ""wedge-style""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""massive"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""wheel"": [""rounded hexagonal"", ""squared""],    ""doors"": [""cut"", ""visually linked""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""massive""],    ""spoiler"": [""big""],    ""exhaust"": [""central""]  }}```"
LANCIA Ypsilon,"After ten years on the market, the third generation of the Lancia Ypsilon was not a spring chicken anymore, so the Italian automaker added a new refresh for it. Once a prestigious brand, Lancia started to fade away, and its line of products was reduced to just one: the Fiat 500-based Ypsilon. It was the carmaker's solution to keep the brand on the market without plunging deep into Fiat's pockets, and it even tried to make some profit by offering a premium vehicle in a segment where customers usually look for lower prices. And yet, there were many people who chose to spend a little more and get a vehicle with a more luxurious look than a mundane Fiat Panda. The upgraded version received a new front fascia enhanced by a grille with satin-chromed vertical slats. In addition, the headlights received new LED daytime running lights inside, underlining the headlamps. At the back, the taillights also received an LED treatment with vertical lines. But all these changes wouldn't have been enough with further enhancements in the cabin. Customers found a new seven-inch infotainment system mounted atop the center stack. This supported Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. That brought the Ypsilon to a new era. Besides that, the automaker added a few colors and materials to the options list. But despite the new look, the Ypsilon still didn't provide a roomier interior for its occupants. Under the hood, the automaker added new gasoline and turbo-diesel engines. In addition, it also offered a hybrid version.",LANCIA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Lancia Ypsilon"",  ""year"": ""third generation"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""luxurious"", ""premium"", ""new era""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""satin-chromed"", ""vertical""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""daytime running"", ""enhanced""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LAND ROVER Range Rover Velar,"Land Rover introduced the Range Rover Velar in 2017 and didn't rush on upgrading it, and it did that only at the beginning of 2023. While other automakers are changing or refreshing their models every other four years, Land Rover didn't bother doing that with the Velar. The car sold very well and was one of the most stylish premium SUVs on the market. It was placed between the Evoque and the Range Rover Sport, but it was based on the same platform as the Jaguar XE, which was a compact-sized premium sedan. The Velar was Land Rover's answer to the premium SUV coupe, such as the GLC Coupe or the BMW X4. Yet, the car's shape was more of a regular SUV with a lower greenhouse and a raked-forward rear windscreen. For the facelifted version, the automaker installed a new design for the grille and new LED headlights that resembled those featured on the Range Rover Sport. In addition, the front bumper was beefier and sported bigger side scoops for a more aggressive stance than its predecessor. Inside, Land Rover installed a new floating curved glass 11.4"" infotainment screen on the center stack that provided more options for the driver and also featured over-the-air updates. Another improvement for the car was the Active Road Noise Cancellation system, which made the Velar even quieter than before. Depending on the market, customers had four trim levels: the Velar S (base model), the Dynamic SE, the Dynamic HSE, and the Autobiography. But the real upgrade was under the car's skin. While the base version came with an inline-four turbocharged engine, the top-of-the-range version named P400 was a plug-in hybrid that featured an inline-six gasoline powerplant helped by a 105 kW electric motor. Moreover, it could run up to 32 miles (51 km) with zero emissions.",LAND ROVER,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Range Rover Velar"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""mid-sized premium SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""stylish"", ""premium"", ""aggressive"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked-forward""],    ""grille"": [""new design""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""new LED"", ""resembling Range Rover Sport""],    ""bumper"": [""beefier"", ""sporty""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""lower greenhouse""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LAND ROVER Range Rover Sport,"Range Rover is known for offering a sportive and luxurious vehicle packed in an SUV body. The new Range Rover Sport SV takes the ""sportive"" title to new heights as it comes equipped with a 626 hp 4.4-liter Twin-Turbo MHEV V8 petrol engine that propels the car to a staggering max speed of 180 mph (290 kph). For a more comprehensive approach to its costumers' preferences, Range Rover also offers a hybrid version of the new model where the electric powertrain is coupled with a 3.0-liter six-cylinder petrol engine to provide 542 hp while also offering a fully electric driving range of up to 75 miles (121 km). This update adapts the car to an urban driving necessity, enabling the driver to make short trips only using electric power quietly and responsively. Dynamic capabilities are enhanced by the unique 6D Dynamics suspension system, an innovative technology that combines hydraulic interlinked dampers, adjustable air springs, and pitch control to increase grip and stability in high-speed corners and sudden accelerations. To complement the balancing capabilities, the Range Rover Sport SV is the first production car to offer 23-inch carbon fiber wheels with a total weight reduction of over 77 lbs (35 kg), compared to the standard 23-inch cast-alloy wheels. A vehicle with this size and power needs a significant force to stop, and Range Rover ensures that the braking capabilities match the speed achievements of the car with the addition of Carbon Ceramic Brakes for the first time on a vehicle constructed by them. The reduction of unsprung mass is just a little addition to the fact that the ceramic brakes offer a way better performance at high temperatures. Over and above this, the wheels are equipped with the largest front calipers ever installed on a Range Rover. The unique eight-piston Brembo Octyma calipers are specifically developed for this vehicle. To fully utilize the enhanced dynamic capabilities of the new Range Rover Sport SV, drivers can elevate the car's sporty character by simply pressing the newly introduced SV Mode button located on the steering wheel. Going beyond the existing Dynamic mode of the Range Rover Sport, SV Mode fine-tunes various aspects of the vehicle. This includes optimizing the steering, eight-speed automatic gearbox, throttle response, exhaust sound, and the 6D Dynamics suspension system. Combining these adjustments results in an exhilarating and immersive driving experience, maximizing the car's dynamic potential. Elevating the feeling of connection to a new level, the new Range Rover Sport SV introduces the Body and Soul Seat (BASS), an immersive audio experience that brings wellness benefits by allowing front seat occupants to sense the sound physically through synchronized audio vibrations.

LAND ROVER Range Rover,"After half-of-century on the market, Land Rover's flagship started its fifth generation with a complete makeover from the ground up. The Range Rover was the original luxury SUV. It offered image, comfort, luxury, and performance. With the fifth generation, Land Rover transitioned towards the electric-powered Range Rover by implementing hybrid drivetrains, and it was available in a short or long wheelbase. Designing a luxobarge with a record aerodynamic factor might be useless as long as the overall frontal fascia was that big. Yet, Land Rover engineers struggled and created a 0.30 Cx, helping the big SUV get a better fuel efficiency. Its front fascia with flush headlights and raked grille looked like they were installed on a concept car. Moreover, another appealing factor was the shaved door handles system carried over from its siblings Range Rover Velar and Jaguar F-Type. The ascending beltline and the falling roof design were part of this aerodynamic concept. Inside, the carmaker used all its resources to create a luxurious environment for four or five occupants. It was available in three trim levels: SE, HSE, and Autobiography. A 13.1"" touchscreen display for the infotainment system allowed access to most onboard computer areas, while the driver's side benefited from a 13.7"" TFT instrument panel. Thanks to its luxurious yet sustainable materials used on the interior, the Range Rover SWB showed a high commitment from the carmaker for a cleaner future. The new MLA platform used by Land Rover allowed the use of a new 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 powerplant carried over from BMW. In addition, a plug-in hybrid version provided a full-electric range of up to 80 km (50 miles).",LAND ROVER,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Range Rover"",  ""year"": ""fifth generation"",  ""size"": ""short or long wheelbase"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxury"", ""aerodynamic"", ""sustainable"", ""concept car"", ""electric-powered""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""flush""],    ""grille"": [""raked""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""flush""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""shaved""],    ""roof"": [""falling""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LAND ROVER Defender 90,"Land Rover brought one of its most iconic models, the Defender, into a new era when it introduced its second generation, and it built it in three versions that sported the traditional 90, 110, and 130 labels. The Defender 90 was the shortest of them all, and it draws back its moniker from the old Series II Land Rover. That model featured just two doors at the front and one entry (side-hinged) in the back and could take as many people on board as they could stuff inside that cramped cabin. Over the years, the Series II became the Defender in the late '80s and was allowed to carry just five people on face-forward seats. That car became an icon and was cherished and loved by many despite its many design flaws. With the second, entirely new generation of the Defender, Land Rover moved this model on a higher level of comfort and quality, but without forgetting its agricultural roots. The car's exterior resembles the old D100 concept car that was unveiled by the British automaker in 2011. In 2019, the production version of that prototype came alive and had the Defender nameplate attached to it. The front fascia featured a pair of headlights adorned by circular LEDs that headlamps installed on its predecessor. Still, the plastic bumper and grille were nothing like those from the previous model. But it looked bold. In addition, the flared wheel arches and the overall look were unmistakably inspired by the Series II and III. The 2019 Defender 90 featured two doors and a short wheelbase, just like its ancestors. The flat, vertical cut at the rear with the externally mounted spare wheel was also charismatic for this model. At the back, the taillights sported a rectangular shape. Inside, it was a modern vehicle fitted with all the features and amenities of an upscale off-roader. There was a digital instrument cluster instead of analog dials and a landscape-oriented touchscreen for the infotainment system on top of the center. Between the comfortable front seats, Land Rover installed a tall center console that housed a few storage areas and an armrest. The gear selector for the automatic transmission found its place closer to the dashboard, like in the old days. Bonus points: It was easier to use. In the back, the carmaker installed a flat-folding bench seat that could accommodate up to three occupants, although the legroom was minimal. But the Defender's real value was under its skin. Land Rover installed a choice of diesel and gasoline engines ranging between 200 PS (197 HP) and 525 PS (518 HP) paired with a standard eight-speed automatic transmission. Power went in all corners via a two-speed transfer box. To better cope with off-road situations, the automaker offered an air suspension for the Defender.",LAND ROVER,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Defender"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""short wheelbase"",  ""overall-design"": [""bold"", ""charismatic"", ""modern"", ""upscale"", ""iconic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""flat"", ""vertical""],    ""grille"": [""plastic"", ""bold""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""circular LEDs""],    ""bumper"": [""plastic""],    ""wheel"": [""flared""],    ""doors"": [""two"", ""front""],    ""roof"": [""flat"", ""externally mounted spare wheel""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""rectangular""]  }}```"
LAND ROVER Discovery Sport,"In 2019, Land Rover launched a heavily revised version for the Discovery Sport. It uses new signature LED headlights and taillights. The platform is a revised D8 (older) platform adapted to receive a plug-in hybrid system, which is now called PTA (Premium Transverse Architecture). The new platform was used for the first time in the Range Rover Evoque, and incorporates a new 48v mild-hybrid system, used to lower the fuel consumption and cut down emissions. For a longer range, the re-worked platform has a 20% bigger fuel tank, which is now 65 liters (17.1 US Gal). Inside, there is room for up to 7 people with a new infotainment system that also provides a 4G hot-spot. USB plugs for every passenger are scattered around the interior. The new Discovery Sport even features an AI system, which “learns” the driver's preferences for the seat position, massage and cabin temperature. The 2019 Discovery Sport has four trim levels: H, SE, HSE and, on top of that the R-Dynamic variant, which has different bumpers and special allow wheels. All of the Land Rover Discovery Sports engines are 2.0-liter with 4 cylinders, turbodiesel or turbo-gasoline. The maximum power offered ranges between 150 to 250 hp. The transmission is FWD for the base 150 hp turbodiesel engine and AWD exclusively for the other variants.",LAND ROVER,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Discovery Sport"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""signature""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""special alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LAND ROVER Range Rover Evoque,"With an adjusted design that fits the model's iconic look, the 2024 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque represents an upgraded version of the second generation of the series. The facelift is refined on the interior and exterior to provide a refreshed configuration in the hopes of a rise in sales numbers. The SUV represents the British carmaker's attempt to extend the life of a successful generation of their model. The powertrain options are unchanged compared to the pre-facelift version. The Range Rover offers multiple gasoline and diesel MHEV engines and also a plug-in hybrid variant in the likes of the P300e. Being an efficient vehicle, Evoque can be used for a short daily commute without any emissions, offering a total electric-only range of up to 39 miles (62km). Operating in fully electric mode requires a short charging time because of the battery's small capacity, going from 0 percent to 100 percent in as little as half an hour. The power is transmitted to the wheels through an intelligent torque-on-demand four-wheel drive system. To highlight its off-road capability, the SUV has a clever function called Terrain Response 2, allowing the driver to choose between Eco, Comfort, Grass-Gravel-Snow, Mud-Ruts, Sand, Dynamic, and Automatic mode. The engine, transmission, all-wheel drive, suspension, and stability control systems are fine-tuned to achieve the best possible traction. The exterior is mostly the same compared to the anterior version of the model. It has a redesigned grille that provides all the Range Rover models with a similar appearance. Also, the headlights come in a thinner version but offer better visibility thanks to the latest Pixel LED technology. Offering a wide range of choices, the Evoque comes in a few different variants, such as Evoque S, Dynamic SE, Dynamic HSE, and Autobiography. Based on these grades, there are options such as 21-inch alloy wheels. To offer an alternative to conventional leather, the highly researched Kvadrat wool blend fabric can also be chosen as an interior cover. Also, the interior has a lot of natural light through a panoramic roof, giving the SUV a more spacious feeling. The vehicle is equipped with the Pivi Pro 2 infotainment system to complement the interior's luxury with adequate technology. Through the 11.4-inch curved glass touchscreen, the front passengers can access all the primary vehicle functions. Supplied with Cabin Air Purification Plus, the Evoque features a system intended to deliver a premium experience to passengers. It is fully controlled from the center console and has sensors that alert the driver when the CO2 levels are abnormally high inside the SUV. The SUV may have what it takes to extend the model's notoriety further. It shares well-known design elements that clearly represent the Evoque and many of the most advanced technologies and systems Land Rover provides to all the cars from their portfolio.",LAND ROVER,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Land Rover Range Rover Evoque"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""compact SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""refined"", ""iconic"", ""efficient"", ""luxurious"", ""spacious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""curved""],    ""grille"": [""redesigned"", ""similar""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""thinner"", ""Pixel LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""21-inch alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""panoramic""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LAND ROVER Range Rover PHEV,"Land Rover introduced a plug-in hybrid version for its flagship model, the Range Rover, and drastically improved the vehicle's fuel efficiency. The race for a cleaner vehicle was on, and most carmakers started offering hybrids and plug-in hybrids on the market, but only a few offered such an option for an SUV. Apart from Volvo, BMW, and Audi, no other carmaker provided a plug-in hybrid. Yet, Jaguar-Land Rover burned the midnight oil and came up with a solution for the big off-road British barge. At the front, there was a similar front fascia as on the regular, gasoline-only powered Range Rovers. Although, the grille was different and featured an access port for the plug. Its new, pixel-LED headlights incorporated 142 light-emitting diodes. Inside, the carmaker designed the interior with its top luxury features. The sunblinds were opened and closed by gestures in front of the rearview mirror, not by pulling a strap or pushing a button. The carmaker installed two 10"" touch screens on the center stack for the infotainment system and climate control unit, while another screen replaced the analog instrument panel. For a truly mobile office, Land Rover fitted the Range Rover PHEV with 17 connection ports inside the cabin, including a home outlet for a printer, if needed. But the most crucial part of the car was under the hood. A turbocharged inline-four gasoline engine served as part of the 404 hp powerplant. Land Rover paired it with a ZF gearbox that integrated an 85 kW motor. Power went in all corners, and since it was a Land Rover, it featured a low-range transmission gear. Thus, it could crawl through rough off-road areas where most other SUVs could only dream about.",LAND ROVER,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Range Rover"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""big off-road"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxury"", ""efficient"", ""hybrid"", ""off-road"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""different"", ""access port""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""pixel-LED"", ""incorporated 142 light-emitting diodes""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LAND ROVER Range Rover Sport SVR,"The horsepower battle evolved in almost all vehicle classes. While it was considered normal for the sports car's territory, it reached an unusual hype amongst the SUV car makers. And Range Rover couldn't resist temptation. Most of the premium SUV manufacturers started to climb the horsepower battle. BMW X5 M, Mercedes-Benz GLE 63 AMG, Porsche Cayenne Turbo S, or Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk are just a few examples of high-power sport-utility vehicles. Range Rover joined the party with the Range Rover Sport 5.0 supercharged and then it added 25 more horsepower and unleashed the Range Rover Sport SVR. SVR is the ultimate version tuned by the SVO – Special Vehicle Operations. A special division owned by the Jaguar – Land Rover that built and developed vehicles from both brands for better road-performance. The SVR featured more than just an addition of power. The exterior design was changed with a new aerodynamic package. The SVR version was fitted with a dedicated carbon-fiber hood. A huge grille was installed in the lower part of the front apron to cool the engine. Two side vents were added for the braking system. In the back, a twin dual exhaust was installed to enhance the V8 supercharged sound. Inside, despite the large size, it featured four individual seats fitted with sport-bucket seats. In an SUV! The dashboard was fitted with new technologies and a big, 12” touchscreen on the center stack. It offered a twin view: one for the driver and another for the side passenger. A head-up display was installed for the driver, showing information from time to time at the eye level. The SVR version featured a re-tuned 5.0-liter supercharged engine carried over from the Range Rover Sport Supercharged. It offered 575 hp and 700 Nm (516 lb-ft) of torque. It was mated as standard with a ZF 8-speed automatic gearbox.",LAND ROVER,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Range Rover Sport SVR"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""aerodynamic"", ""premium"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""huge""],    ""hood"": [""carbon-fiber""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""twin dual""],    ""seats"": [""sport-bucket"", ""four individual""],    ""dashboard"": [""technological"", ""12” touchscreen""],    ""head-up display"": [""driver-oriented""],    ""engine"": [""5.0-liter supercharged"", ""575 hp"", ""700 Nm torque"", ""ZF 8-speed automatic""]  }}```"
LAND ROVER Defender 110,"Land Rover Defender returned to the market after a four-year hiatus, and it was a revolution compared to its famous, older sibling. The 2019 Defender was ready for the 21st century. When Rover introduced the Series 1 in 1948 as the Land Rover, it was mostly an agricultural vehicle built to take its owners to the field and back and work all day long. But the little rugged car evolved, and the Land Rover became a distinct brand from the Rover three decades later, in 1978. It was already known as an off-road vehicle manufacturer. The old Series I evolved into the Series II, and then, in 1989, these were replaced by the Defender. After three unsuccessful marriages, one with Honda, the second with BMW, and the third with Ford, Land Rover ended up together with its Jaguar sibling in Tata Motor Company. The new owner paid for the development of the Defender’s second generation, which was launched in September 2019 at the Frankfurt Motor Show. For the new generation, Land Rover made a unibody construction for the vehicle, ditching the body-on-frame structure that was previously used. The 110, which was the five-door, long-wheelbase version, shared its front fascia with the rest of the range. It featured a pair of headlights adorned by circular LED daytime running lights, which resembled the older headlights used on the 1989 Defender. Its plastic bumper was extended in the lower area by an underbody shield. From its sides, the flared wheel arches and the flat door panels resembled those from its predecessor. Behind the rear doors, the automaker placed a wider C-pillar. The flat, vertical cut at the rear with the externally mounted spare wheel was also charismatic for this model. At the back, the taillights sported a rectangular shape with small LED lamps. Inside, it was a modern vehicle fitted with all the features and amenities of an upscale off-roader. There was a digital instrument cluster instead of analog dials and a landscape-oriented touchscreen for the infotainment system on top of the center. Between the comfortable front seats, Land Rover installed a tall center console that housed a few storage areas and an armrest. The gear selector for the automatic transmission found its place closer to the dashboard, like in the old days. In the back, passengers could share the split-folding bench seat and had enough legroom and headroom. In addition, the automaker offered a jump seat between the front passengers or two folding seats in the trunk. Under the hood, Land Rover installed a choice of diesel and gasoline engines mated to standard eight-speed automatic transmissions. Like its predecessor, it was an all-wheel-drive vehicle and featured a two-speed transfer case. But, unlike that, the 2020 Defender 110 was also available with air suspension, which could raise or lower the vehicle.",LAND ROVER,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Defender"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""five-door, long-wheelbase"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""modern"", ""charismatic"", ""upscale"", ""off-road""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""vertical""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""flat""],    ""headlights"": [""circular LED"", ""resembling older headlights""],    ""bumper"": [""plastic"", ""extended"", ""lower area"", ""underbody shield""],    ""wheel"": [""flared arches""],    ""doors"": [""flat panels""],    ""roof"": [""wider C-pillar"", ""externally mounted spare wheel""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LAND ROVER Discovery,"The 2017 Land Rover Discovery was a completely new model, designed from the ground up. But, somehow, succeeded to keep the original cues of the Discovery Series I with its specific two-stage roof. At the front, the 2017 model featured a smaller grille than on the models before. The idea behind the concept was to make the car more aerodynamic than its predecessors. That wasn't too hard since the Discovery 3 and the LR4 were basically squared. The biggest challenge was to make the car more aerodynamic but to keep its superior SUV appearance with true off-road capabilities. Unlike most of the cars on the market, the 2017 Discovery had a small grille and a very big bumper. In the lower part, it had a silver shield and on the sides, it had air-vents for brakes cooling. The roofline had a small ascending slope over the C-pillar to improve the headroom for the rear passengers. The dynamic look was enhanced by the standard 19"" wheels. As an option, light-alloy wheels of up to 22"" in size were available. Inside, the Discovery took some amenities from its Jaguar siblings, most noticeable being the infotainment unit that featured a dual-screen view. Like the generations before it, the 2017 Discovery had an option of up to 7 seats. Due to vehicle size, the last row was suitable even for adult passengers, not only for toddlers. The off-road capabilities were kept at the Land Rover standards, with a wading depth of up to 850 mm (33.5""). The ground clearance of up to 22 cm (8.6"") made the car very capable of untraced paths.",LAND ROVER,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Land Rover Discovery"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""aerodynamic"", ""SUV appearance"", ""dynamic"", ""spacious"", ""off-road capable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""angled""],    ""grille"": [""small""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""big""],    ""wheel"": [""19-inch standard"", ""up to 22-inch available""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""two-stage"", ""ascending slope over C-pillar""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LAND ROVER Range Rover Evoque Convertible,"In 2016 Land Rover dared to cut the Evoque roof and made it a convertible, in the same way Nissan offered the Murano with a rag-top. Unfortunately, both of them shared the same fate, and their sales figures were less than satisfactory. On the other hand, Land Rover benefited from the great image on the market, and the Range Rover Evoque was more of a fashion item than a transportation device. The British brand was known enough for its bold moves on the market, and their idea didn't seem out of place, but maybe it was not the right time. The Evoque Convertible shared some parts with the three-door version. It sported the same front fascia with slim headlights and a black mesh-grille above the bumper. On the lower side, a broader and taller grille surrounded by a black rim made the car looks taller than it was. From its profile, the straight, ascending beltline ran uninterrupted by any B- or C-pillar. It was a true cabriolet for four passengers. In the back, the small trunk was opened upwards, if needed. Land Rover built the Evoque's with four seats, but the rear passengers hardly had any legroom if the front occupants were just a bit above an average-sized adult occupant. On the other hand, for the front seat occupants, there was room enough. The flat, low-mounted dashboard featured a tilted center stack extended toward the center console. Under the hood, the Evoque Convertible featured a small engine range but offered enough power and torque for short and long trips.",LAND ROVER,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Range Rover Evoque"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""fashionable"", ""bold"", ""tall"", ""sporty"", ""compact""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""slim""],    ""grille"": [""black mesh"", ""broad"", ""taller""],    ""hood"": [""uninterrupted"", ""flat""],    ""headlights"": [""slim""],    ""bumper"": [""black-rimmed""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""three-door""],    ""roof"": [""convertible""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""small""]  }}```"
LAND ROVER Range Rover L,"Land Rover introduced an extended wheelbase version for its flagship model Range Rover, which was already at its fourth generation. The British carmaker had extensive experience in building off-road vehicles and combined that with luxury features when it created the 2012 Range Rover. It was the first generation that relied on an aluminum unit-body construction, which raised more difficulties when the carmaker tried to build a long-wheelbase version. Yet, the British engineers succeeded in overcoming all of those and made it. From the front, it showed a different pattern for the mesh-grille, adorned by rectangular cuts inside each of the three horizontal slats that filled the area between the headlights. The Range Rover L featured a specific badge under the four-slats chromed Atlas vents from the front doors. Since most of the 200 mm (7.9"") extended wheelbase was added for the rear passengers, the rear doors were longer. The fourth generation of the Range Rover didn't provide too much legroom for the rear passengers, but this L version fixed that. It added 186 mm (7.3"") more legroom in the back. A 1.83 m (6 ft) occupant could completely stretch his or her legs. A two-seat layout was available as an option, with a wide console between the rear occupants. Land Rover made that version without compromising the car's offroad abilities, at least not that much. It still offered the same wading depth, but it added a new setting for the standard air suspension that lowered the vehicle 49 mm (1.9"") in access mode. The carmaker offered it with fewer engine versions than the standard wheelbase version.",LAND ROVER,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Range Rover"",  ""year"": ""2012"",  ""size"": ""extended wheelbase"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxury"", ""off-road"", ""aluminum construction"", ""chrome accents"", ""spacious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""mesh"", ""rectangular cuts"", ""horizontal slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""longer rear doors""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LAND ROVER Range Rover Sport PHEV,"Land Rover introduced the facelifted version of the Range Rover Sport's second generation at the 2017 Los Angeles Auto Show, and besides the SVR and the high-performance versions, it brought the plug-in hybrid model as well. Time had changed, and the most promising versions of an SUV were the hybrid and the plug-in hybrid versions, respectively. That forced the British carmaker to create vehicles with a lower carbon footprint and chose the LA Auto Show as the scene to show it. At the front, the RRS PHEV featured the newly introduced Premium headlight package, with 24 LEDs per vehicle, while the optional Matrix-LED system came with 52 light-emitting diodes. Unlike its siblings, the plug-in hybrid version concealed the plug-in port in the front grille, on the driver's side. Inside, the Range Rover Sport P400 received an ample revamp with the introduction of the dual-view touch-screen monitor carried over from its sibling, the Range Rover Velar. At the front, the new, slimmer front seats offered better body support thanks to their higher bolstering areas. The standard version offered 8-way adjustments and a top version with up to 16 ways. To enhance the quality of the inside air, the Range Rover Sport was fitted with an air ionization system. Unsurprisingly, though, the P400 offered the same interior space as its siblings, even though it had to accommodate a battery pack. But the most significant change was under its skin, where Land Rover installed a 300 PS (296 hp) turbocharged gasoline engine and a 116 PS (114 hp) electric motor for a total of 404 PS (398 hp) output. It was paired as standard to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Thanks to its plug-in hybrid system, the RRS P400 offered a 31 miles (51 km) EV mode and averaged an incredibly low fuel consumption.",LAND ROVER,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Range Rover Sport"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""ample"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""modern"", ""efficient""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""concealed"", ""front""],    ""hood"": [""slimmer""],    ""headlights"": [""premium"", ""LED"", ""slimmer""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LAND ROVER Discovery SVX,"The third generation of the Land Rover Discovery was unveiled at the 2016 Paris Motor Show and it was based on the same platform as the Range Rover Sport and Range Rover Sport. Unlike its smaller brother, the Discovery Sport, the Discovery was engineered to tackle hard off-road. Moreover, it was fitted with bigger engines and up to seven seats even in the all-wheel-drive version. In fact, it wasn't offered as a two-wheel-drive at all. The SVX version was a 2018 addition to the existing range. It was offered as a highly capable off-road vehicle. It was the Rubicon of the Land Rover. But it was built like a rally raid vehicle, with some stylish front bumper and apron, but kept its bodywork protected from the rocks thanks to high ground clearance and the standard pneumatic suspension. On top of the car, a light-pod with LED-lights was installed. In the back, a wide gap in the bumper revealed the hook for the factory-installed electric winch. Inside, there was the usual luxury of a Land Rover, with a big, 10” touch-screen in the dashboard. The car featured more off-road options such as the low-range gear, or the locking differentials. It was available with a five or seven-seat configuration. The powertrain featured a supercharged 5.0-liter V8 engine, tuned for more torque on low RPMs. The 8-speed automatic transmission was fitted as standard.",LAND ROVER,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Land Rover Discovery"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""luxurious"", ""off-road capable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""stylish""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""wide gap"", ""protective""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""pneumatic suspension""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""factory-installed electric winch""]  }}```"
LAND ROVER Defender 130,"Like its famous rugged, body-on-frame predecessor, the 2022 Land Rover Defender was available as a long-wheelbase version named Defender 130, even though it came on the market two years after its siblings. Back in 1983, when Land Rover decided to offer a more utilitarian version for the already rugged vehicle, it added a longer chassis with a 127"" (3.2m) wheelbase. It offered it with either a single- or a double-cab pickup bodywork. In those times, the car didn't sport the Defender nameplate. That came later, and it was again offered with that long-wheelbase version. In 2022, the carmaker chose a different approach for its famous SUV. Sharing the same wheelbase as the Defender 110, the 130 version featured a longer rear end. Thus, the trunk area sported a longer floor with wider side windows and quarter panels behind the rear doors. The 1.49 m (58.7"") rear overhang decreased the departure angle of the SUV but offered more room inside. Moreover, even though it had plenty of space for the spare wheel, it still had it on the rear door. Inside, the most significant change was, obviously, in the back. Land Rover installed the third row of seats, with enough room for three adults, leading to an eight-seat vehicle. Last but not least, the trunk area was more than enough. It provided up to 2,516 liters (88.8 cu-ft) of space up from the 2,380 liters (84 cu-ft) available in the Defender 110. Like its siblings, the SUV offered a standard 11.4"" Pivi Pro touch-screen infotainment system, with OTA (over the air) updates. Under the hood, the 2022 Defender 130 received a choice of inline-six hybrid powertrains, ranging from 246hp to 395hp.",LAND ROVER,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Defender"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""long-wheelbase"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""utilitarian"", ""spacious"", ""modern"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LEXUS GX,"After more than 20 years since the model's first generation, the 2024 Lexus GX marks a new standard for luxury amongst medium-sized SUVs. The new model comes with a totally redesigned exterior based on straight horizontal lines and rough edges to underline the car's toughness and off-road capabilities. Complemented by a palette of earthy tones, the rugged vehicle's exterior is meant to blend in with various nature sceneries with the objective of producing one of the most well-balanced off-road experiences. The six grades that the model offers will also take a toll on its exterior appearance as some exclusive design features are only available for specific grades. To offer enough power, the GX has a standard configuration that includes a competent and efficient twin-turbocharged 3.4-liter V6 engine, complemented by a 10-speed Direct Shift Automatic Transmission. With the twin-turbo V6, the GX achieves an impressive 349 hp, surpassing the previous generation V8's 301 hp. Moreover, torque output experiences a significant boost, reaching a massive 479 lb-ft and providing a maximum towing capacity of 8,000 lbs (3,628 kg). The twin turbochargers ensure consistent and controlled acceleration, enabling smooth power delivery in both on and off-road situations. Lexus also said that a hybrid powertrain will also be available for the model. As a contrasting feature of the raw exterior, the interior of the SUV has an abundance of premium features and high-quality trims. Besides the increased comfort for the passengers that can be seated on the three rows of the car, the GX takes a pragmatic approach by providing a driver-oriented cockpit design that features an arrangement of instruments made to minimize potential driver distraction. The front 12.3-inch infotainment display pairs well with the optional 21-speaker Mark Levinson audio system capable of providing fantastic surround sound, perfect for increasing comfort during long trips. In addition to its already tough and rugged exterior, the Overtrail and Overtrail+ brand-new grades models enhance their appeal with a range of features and specialized styling. The Overtrail grades come equipped with standard 33-inch All-Terrain tires mounted on 18-inch wheels, black accented overfenders, and an aluminum skid plate as standard features, further enhancing their rugged appearance. All the visual features would've meant nothing if the Lexus GX didn't have such amazing off-road features. These include Multi-Terrain Select (MTS), Crawl Control, Downhill Assist Control (DAC), and 3D Multi-Terrain Monitor systems. Additionally, to improve wheel articulation, an Electronic-Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (E-KDSS) is also included. For maximum traction, the OVERTRAIL model exclusively features an electronic locking rear differential. The 2024 Lexus GX may be one of the most versatile SUV's in the world as it offers a luxurious interior encapsulated in a car that can easily withstand some of the toughest off-road challenges.",LEXUS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Lexus GX"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""medium-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""luxurious"", ""tough"", ""off-road"", ""premium""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""straight"", ""horizontal""],    ""grille"": [""rugged"", ""exclusive""],    ""hood"": [""rough""],    ""headlights"": [""pragmatic"", ""driver-oriented""],    ""bumper"": [""rugged""],    ""wheel"": [""18-inch"", ""All-Terrain""],    ""doors"": [""premium""],    ""roof"": [""tough"", ""rugged""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LEXUS ES,"Lexus refreshed its best-selling model, the ES, in 2023 for the 2024 model year, and, along with some new wheels and minor exterior updates, it also drastically improved the interior and drivetrain. The ES shared its platform with the Camry and the Avalon. In 2018, the Japanese premium automaker introduced the seventh generation of the ES, and even though it shared its underpinnings with the other two sedans from Toyota, it came with different settings that made it feel sportier. In addition, the standard 18"" light-alloy wheels for the base trim level and the 19"" ones for the upper ones gave the car a distinct, sporty look. In addition, for the 2024 model year, the ES offered standard Bi-LED headlamps. But the most significant change was inside the vehicle, where Lexus improved the cabin after it listened to its customers. It took too many years for the automaker to understand that the touchpad was a pain for most users and was mostly useless while driving. By removing it, it cleared the area and made room for a pair of cup holders for both front occupants. At the lower side of the center stack, the automaker placed the HVAC controls, including those for the heated steering wheel and the cooled and warmed seats. Above it, Lexus placed the sound system that was also available with a 17 speakers Mark Levinson option. Furthermore, the infotainment unit featured a 12.3"" touchscreen placed atop the center stack and provided wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Fortunately, the Japanese premium automaker kept the turning knob for the volume, even though it ditched the CD player from the sound system. The driver could enjoy the digital dashboard and also the head-up display. In addition, Lexus tried to pamper its users and offered an option for wood trims on the steering wheel. Thanks to the vehicle's long wheelbase, the automaker could provide enough legroom for passengers seated in the back. Thus, the ES proved to be not just an excellent executive vehicle but also a great family car. Lexus offered the 2024 ES with a choice of gasoline engines. The base model offered a decent, fuel-efficient 2.5-liter inline-four that sent the power in all corners via an electronically controlled AWD system. The most powerful version offered customers a 3.5-liter V6 which sent all of its ponies exclusively to the front wheels via an eight-speed automatic gearbox. For those looking for an electrified vehicle, Lexus offered the choice of a 2.5-liter inline-four unit that ran in the Atkinson cycle and was helped by a high-density electric motor. Unfortunately, due to the li-ion battery pack placed under the rear seats, this version was available with just a front-wheel drive option. But it was an excellent choice for those living in areas where snow never comes.",LEXUS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""ES"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""sporty"", ""distinct"", ""executive"", ""family""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""distinct""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""Bi-LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""18-inch light-alloy"", ""19-inch sporty""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LEXUS RX,"Lexus introduced the fifth generation of the RX range in 2022, a vehicle that showed a slight improvement in the exterior styling but a more refined interior and improvements in the safety sector. After more than 3,5-million units sold, the RX range was a bestseller in the carmaker's lineup. It did that in two decades across four generations since 1998. It was also at the forefront of the hybrid technology in the SUV segment, paving the way for more electrified vehicles on the market. Lexus built the fifth generation of the RX on the enhanced GA-K platform, which allowed it to offer the vehicle as a gasoline-powered vehicle, a hybrid, and a plug-in hybrid. Even though the car's shape looked virtually unchanged, there were important modifications. It featured a longer wheelbase, a lowered roofline, and an extended hood. At the back, the coupe-like tailgate was raked-forward, emphasized by the blackened part of the C-pillar. In addition, the car's headlights were more horizontal than before and featured triple-LEDs. Moreover, the L-shaped DRLs enhanced the sporty look of the vehicle. The interior featured a 14"" infotainment display placed atop the center stack. Despite the general trend of creating a unitary line of screens with the instrument cluster, Lexus chose differently by installing a classic instrument cluster in front of the driver. Depending on the trim level and options, the car offered a leather-wrapped interior with split-folding rear seats and enough comfort for five adults. Under the hood, Lexus understood that different countries had different needs, so it provided the RX with a turbocharged gasoline engine for the Eastern European market. At the same time, the rest of the world received only the hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions. The latter was a premiere for the RX range.",LEXUS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""RX"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""extended, longer wheelbase"",  ""overall-design"": [""refined"", ""sporty"", ""coupe-like"", ""enhanced"", ""classic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""virtually unchanged""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""extended""],    ""headlights"": [""horizontal"", ""triple-LEDs"", ""L-shaped DRLs""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""lowered""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LEXUS NX,"Lexus unveiled the second generation of the NX in June 2021, and despite its look very similar to its predecessor, it was a completely new vehicle from tip to toe. The NX was the premium sibling of the Toyota Rav4, and they both shared the same TNGA-K platform with the Avalon or the Highlander models built by the same Japanese carmaker. That allowed front or all-wheel-drive systems, gasoline or hybrid power engines, and starting with the 2022 NX, a plug-in hybrid. The 2022 NX featured a new front fascia with a more expansive ""spindle-grille"" design. It wasn't everybody's cup of tea, but it worked well for other vehicles within the Lexus range. It also sported new LED headlights and L-shaped daytime running lights. The door panels and fenders were a mix of curved angular lines and curved areas. At the back, the taillights featured a connecting light strip that ran across the tailgate. Its raked-forward windscreen and C-pillars enhanced the vehicle's dynamic look, while the roof spoiler created an even sportier image. Inside, Lexus installed a 7"" instrument panel named Multi Instrument Display (MID) complemented by a 10"" Head Up Display (HUD) available as an option. The carmaker placed a standard 9.8"" touchscreen above the center stack for the infotainment unit, with an option for a 14"" display. It featured wireless connectivity with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, enhancing the driver's experience. Lexus kept the physical turn-dials for the volume and climate control unit. The NX provided seating for four with high-bolstered front bucket seats and a bench for two in the back. Under the hood, the compact SUV featured a range of four engines, starting with a 2.5-liter inline-four that replaced the older 2.0-liter unit and went up to a turbocharged and electrified 2.4-liter, 275 hp four-banger.",LEXUS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""NX"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""dynamic"", ""sporty"", ""angular"", ""curved""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked-forward""],    ""grille"": [""expansive"", ""spindle""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""L-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""curved"", ""angular""],    ""roof"": [""spoiler"", ""sporty""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LEXUS LX,"Lexus introduced the fourth generation of the LX in 2021 based on the Toyota Land Cruiser J300 series. It used the same body-on-frame GA-F platform but was heavily enhanced with luxurious amenities that belonged to the premium segment. The 2021 LX was not developed as a new vehicle from the ground up. While it still shared many technical components with the less-expensive Land Cruiser, it featured specific details and assemblies for the premium segment. At the front, it featured the specific Spindle-grille. While that design element looked proper for a sedan or smaller SUV, it resembled a gate, or a wall, when placed on the LX's tall and wide front fascia. It was flanked by a pair of tall scoops, which hosted the LED foglights. But the connection with the Land Cruiser J300 is obvious when viewed from the side due to the same profile. At the back, the LED taillights featured a light strip that ran across the tailgate. A roof spoiler enhanced the car's look, even though it wasn't that much of a use. Available with a five or four-seat layout, the LX's interior was more appropriate for a luxury vehicle than any Land Cruiser. Its instrument panel featured a total of 19.3"" screens. An upper 12.3"" monitor showed the infotainment system, while a lower-mounted 7"" display served as a control panel for the climate control and Multi-Terrain Select command center. Under the hood, Lexus installed a twin-turbo V6 powerplant paired with a ten-speed automatic gearbox. Power went in all four corners, and unlike the third LX's generation, this one featured a longer wheel-travel for both axles. Thus, Toyota confirmed its expertise in the off-road area.",LEXUS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""LX"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""tall and wide"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""premium"", ""specific"", ""enhanced"", ""appropriate""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""specific"", ""Spindle""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""tall""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""twin-turbo"", ""longer wheel-travel""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LEXUS IS,"Lexus introduced the last update for the third generation of the IS range in 2020. It was a mandatory revamp of its compact sedan, to keep its sales figure up in a harsh market hit by the world pandemic. When Toyota decided to build a car to compete against the BMW 3-Series in 1998, the world looked amused at them. But from the second generation, the IS became a real competitor for the German brand. The last update for the IS brought a new image for the car. The designers installed new headlights and the spindle grille, which was in line with the Lexus range's aesthetic trend. The car was lower and wider than the non-facelifted version, due to its enlarged fenders. On its sides, the IS featured a new design for the sills that amplified the vehicle's muscular profile. Lexus prepared a new infotainment unit for the restyled interior that featured Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. The 8"" touch-screen was fitted as standard, while a 10.3"" unit was available as an option. Depending on the trim level, Lexus offered sport seats, leather upholstery, or simple, high-quality coth. Lexus offered three engine choices, with either a turbocharged inline-four or two V6 units. The base model featured a rear-wheel-drive architecture while the V6 versions were offered with an all-wheel-drive system and a Torsen limited-slip rear differential. All versions were paired as standard to an 8-speed automatic.",LEXUS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""IS"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""lower, wider"",  ""overall-design"": [""muscular"", ""modern"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""spindle""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""new""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""restyled""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LEXUS LS,"Lexus introduced the fifth generation of the LS in 2017 and updated it in 2020, after three decades on the market. It was the real Japanese alternative for the luxury German brands. By 2020, most car-customers within the premium segment knew that Lexus was founded as the Toyota's premium brand. Lexus made a name of itself by topping the reliability charts all over the world, and offering hybrid versions long before they were a cool thing. The 2020 LS was updated with new features and technologies. From the outside, there were minor modifications to the bodywork. At the front, the car featured a redesigned air-scoops in front of the wheels, with a mesh-grille instead of horizontal slats. At the bottom, the car-maker installed the radar for the adaptive cruise control system on the main grille. The air-vent behind the front wheel-arches was new as well. In the back, the designers applied a new design for the apron. Inside, the 2020 model featured a wrap-around sensation of the dashboard, which was continued on the door panels with the same materials and textures. The screen for the infotainment system was fitted with a 12.3"" screen. It wasn't a touch-screen, but it was Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatible. To access its menus, Lexus installed a touch-pad on the center console. For the drivetrain, the car-maker installed the same powertrain as before: a twin-turbo 3.5-liter V6 plus an electric motor. It offered the LS500 with either a rear or an all-wheel-drive system.",LEXUS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""LS"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""full-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxury"", ""sophisticated"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""mesh"", ""redesigned""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""revised""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LEXUS RC,"The facelift for the Lexus RC was shown to the public in 2018 at the Paris Motor Show. It brought upgrades for luxury coupe made by the Japanese car-maker. It was built to compete against the main German coupe vehicles on a mixed platform, which gathered together the front of a Lexus GS, the mid-section of a Lexus IS of the second generation and the rear of the Lexus IS from the third generation. It was high-tech and with hybrids engines that could achieve very good city mileage due to the brand's experience into this type of engines, Lexus tried to maintain the RC's dynamic coupe proportions while adding more elegance to its exterior. The new front bumper design and the new grille that was transformed from the upper section to the bottom were new design elements. Optional triple LED headlights were added for more refinement. Depending on the trim level and engine version, the car was fitted with 19"" light-alloy-wheels. Inside, there were few new modifications where a new, dark gray streamline treatment has been applied to the heater control panel and audio panel, while enlarged knee pads have been raised to create a heightened sense of space. The sport bucket-seats were highly bolstered for better support while cornering. The infotainment system was installed far on the dashboard, beyond the reach. It could have been controlled via a touch-pad from the center console.",LEXUS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Lexus RC"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""dynamic coupe proportions"",  ""overall-design"": [""high-tech"", ""elegant"", ""refined"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""new"", ""transformed"", ""bottom""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""triple LED"", ""refined""],    ""bumper"": [""new"", ""front""],    ""wheel"": [""19\"" light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LEXUS CT,"Due to new pollution regulations, most of the car-makers had to bring new vehicles on the market, in 2017. Lexus had to improve its already old CT range. Usually, a car is refreshed after four years from its launch and it stays on the market another three or four years after the facelift. For Lexus CT200h the first facelift was in 2013 and, in 2017, a second refresh was made for the premium hybrid compact-hatchback. If you didn't win a contest of “find 10 differences between two pictures”, probably you wouldn't notice the differences between the 2013 and the 2017 CT200h models. The biggest difference was on the redesigned grille, which featured a 3D design pattern for the latter model and horizontal slats for the former. The Japenese car-maker didn't even bother to change the light-alloy wheels. In the back, there were new LED taillights, with side-fins for aerodynamic purposes or for a better look. Inside, the main difference was the wider, 10.3”, infotainment display offered as an option. It was still placed on top of the dashboard like it was planted after the car left the assembly line. There were no other notable differences inside the cabin. At least, the designers didn't break the good things they did before. For the drivetrain, the CT200h featured the same 1.8-liter Atkinson cycle gasoline engine with a 60kW electric motor. It was mated to the same CVT that made the car fuel-efficient.",LEXUS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Lexus CT200h"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""premium"", ""hybrid"", ""compact"", ""aerodynamic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""redesigned"", ""3D design pattern"", ""horizontal slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LEXUS LC,"After almost a decade of absence in the open-top premium luxury segment, Lexus tried to conquer its lost ground with the LC 500 Convertible that it launched at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show for the 2021 model year. Lexus tried to compete in more areas of the premium market, and besides its SUVs and luxury sedans, it also tried to get a slice out of the convertible segment. As a result, in 1991, it launched the SC 430 and made it until 2010 in two generations. But in 2010, it stopped production since sales were not very significant. Moreover, the world financial crisis affected the automaker, and it had to ditch its hard-to-sell models. But in 2019, Lexus made a comeback with the LC 500 Convertible, a model that tried to attack the BMW 8 Series convertible and the Mercedes-Benz S-Class convertible. The new model offered a competitive and luxurious alternative to those vehicles. The convertible version of the LC 500 carried over most of the design elements from its coupe sibling. As a result, the front fascia featured the same spindle grille design and the organic, swept-back headlights. From its profile, the LC500 Convertible revealed thick A-pillars for the windshield and a slightly raised waistline behind the cabin. On the rear quarter panels, at the lower side, the automaker added air intakes that channeled airflow around the rear wheels and reduced turbulences. Finally, at the back, the LED taillights mimicked the headlights’ design with a three-spike shape. Underneath the bumper, two rectangular exhaust trims adorned the apron in front of the actual pipes. Inside, Lexus tried its best to create a luxurious cabin fit for two adults. Even if the car featured two seats in the back, there was actually no legroom for someone to sit there. The front sports seats were offered as standard, and there was a special package for premium sports seats that offered aniline leather and high bolstered area for comfort and side support during high-speed cornering. On the center console, the automaker placed the buttons and touchpad for the infotainment system and, under a flip-up cover, the buttons for the fabric roof. Unlike its predecessor, the LC500 Convertible featured a four-layer rag top that could be opened or closed at speeds of up to 30 mph (48 kph) in about 20 seconds. The instrument cluster featured a digital display for the speedometer inside the tachometer. On its visor, Lexus placed the controls for the driving programs and the traction control settings. As for the trunk, the Lexus LC 500 was not very generous, offering just 149 liters (5.3 cu-ft) of space. Under the hood, Lexus installed its 5.0-liter V8 gasoline engine. It was paired with a ten-speed automatic transmission that sent all the oomph to the rear wheels via a limited-slip differential.",LEXUS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""LC 500 Convertible"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""luxury"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""sleek"", ""sporty"", ""premium"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""swept-back"", ""thick A-pillars""],    ""grille"": [""spindle""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""organic"", ""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [""rectangular exhaust trims""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""two-seater"", ""premium sports seats""],    ""roof"": [""four-layer rag top""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""rectangular trims""]  }}```"
LEXUS TX,"The 2024 TX represents the first of its kind. Lexus introduced the new premium SUV with three rows of seats to the North American market. TX is the first Lexus to be assembled at the Toyota Motor Manufacturing in Indiana and is based on the GA-K platform. It is built to provide space, comfort, and luxury, adapting to the Japanese automaker's values. The vehicle comes with all-wheel drive in all its versions. Lexus offers a 2.4-liter turbocharged gasoline engine, a Parallel (mild) Hybrid version, and a plug-in hybrid version for the SUV. The basic gasoline engine can also be paired with front-wheel drive. The plug-in hybrid version found on the TX 550h+ version is based on a 3.5-liter V6 engine and is complemented by a CVT transmission to produce a power output of 406 hp (411 Ps). The mild hybrid version comes with a six-speed automatic transmission, while the turbocharged gasoline engine is enhanced by an eight-speed automatic transmission. The vehicle's exterior is shaped to enhance its aerodynamic performance, with engineers striving to achieve optimal results while maintaining the body's size in order to provide enough comfort for passengers across all three rows of seats. The headlights appear to be linked by an opening in the hood, while the L-shaped taillights give the impression of emerging from a continuous strip of light. Four grades are available for the 2024 Lexus TX: Standard, Premium, Luxury, and F SPORT Performance. These grades offer many optional features that help the vehicle have a more customizable appearance. There are 22-inch wheels available for Luxury grade as an optional feature and as a standard for the F SPORT Performance to replace the basic 20-inch wheels. Many color options are also available based on the grade of the SUV. With a focal point on making every seat in the car enjoyable, Lexus has developed a technologized interior with many features and storage devices throughout the vehicle. There are seven charging ports and three power outlets to ensure that all the rows receive equal treatment when it comes to staying connected. Interior customization isn't only defined by the palette of colors available for the vehicle. The second row can also be configured as two captain chairs or a folding bench. To boost the accessibility to the third row, the bench folds almost instantly at the touch of a button. Even with the third row of seats in place, the cargo space is ample enough to fit seven suitcases but can be extended up to 97 cubic feet (2,750 liters). The TX has all the features to perform well on the North American market as it offers top-class comfort, luxury, and power, all combined in a big body seven-seater that can easily accommodate big families.",LEXUS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""2024 Lexus TX"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""big body seven-seater"",  ""overall-design"": [""aerodynamic"", ""luxurious"", ""customizable"", ""technologized"", ""spacious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""grille"": [""premium"", ""customizable""],    ""hood"": [""linked headlights"", ""opening""],    ""headlights"": [""linked"", ""L-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""22-inch available"", ""20-inch standard""],    ""doors"": [""technologized"", ""configurable""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LEXUS LBX,"Lexus, established in 1989, has a rich history of innovation and redefining luxury in the automotive industry. The latest addition to its lineup, the Lexus LBX, is a revolutionary compact hybrid SUV that challenges the norms of traditional luxury cars and aims to revolutionize the brand. The LBX incorporates an advanced self-charging hybrid system with a compact, lightweight 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine. Key components of the hybrid system, such as the transaxle and power control unit, have undergone significant improvements to enhance efficiency, minimize losses, reduce weight, and achieve a more compact size. Additionally, a newly developed NiMH battery enables additional electric motor assistance during acceleration, extending the car's all-electric EV driving range. Setting itself apart, the LBX introduces a disruptive approach to the conventional grade strategy. It offers customers the freedom to express their tastes and styles through a choice of four unique atmospheres in addition to the base grade of the vehicle. These atmospheres express elegant, dynamic, or sporty themes through distinctive styling details, colors, textures, and finishes. Furthermore, the LBX provides a personalized option through the Lexus Bespoke Build program. With its compact dimensions, the LBX provides an excellent vantage point from the steering wheel, allowing the driver to experience heightened confidence, comfort, and control in alignment with the Lexus Driving Signature. Meticulous attention has been given to the hoods' shaping and the front pillars' design and placement, resulting in minimized blind spots and an extended downward view. These features improve steering precision, enabling the driver to navigate through more precise routes. At the front, the LBX displays a seamless and frameless grille, accentuating the car's dynamic presence and defining the athletic lines of its body. The rear of the vehicle commands attention with a distinct stance. The license plate has been relocated to the bumper to emphasize the prominence of the LEXUS  signature on the back door, creating a clean and spacious surface for the signature to shine. Built on the GA-B small car global architecture platform, the LBX benefits from a low center of gravity, wide tracks, short overhangs, and a highly rigid body, resulting in confident and comfortable driving dynamics. The hybrid system delivers enjoyable performance with instant acceleration and enhanced fuel efficiency. The LBX also offers the Lexus E-Four all-wheel drive option, providing added stability and confidence. Inside the LBX, simplicity, elegance, and high quality are evident. It offers a range of premium materials, including a vegan-friendly option. The driver's cockpit ensures controls and information sources are within easy reach, enhancing accessibility while driving.

LEXUS LM,"The Japanese automaker launched the second generation of its premium minivan at the 2023 Shanghai Auto Show. Despite not being hotcakes anymore, MPVs excelled in one area where no other crossover or SUV couldn't: roominess. That was something anyone knew, but while some people didn't want to ride in a van-like vehicle, others needed that space for comfort. Lexus understood that clearly, and that's why it produced such a vehicle. The first generation was introduced in 2020 as an up-scale, badge-engineered Toyota Alphard. While some might call this new model a facelift for that, the reworked bodywork and platform and the changes involved in the vehicle allowed the carmaker to call it a new generation. At the front, Lexus installed its already-known spindle grille that looked ginormous, covering most of the front fascia from the hood to the air dam. It was flanked on the lower side by two vents that channeled the air around the bodywork. Above the bumper were the slim headlights surrounded by daytime running lights. As expected, only LEDs were used for these. From its sides, the minivan featured front-hinged doors for the driver and side passenger and sliding ones for those seated in the back. The LM ended with a vertical tailgate adorned by a top-mounted roof spoiler. The interior could compete against any other luxurious vehicle on the market. At the front was a standard cabin with two seats separated by a tall center console. The dashboard was covered in leather and wood trims and supported a giant touchscreen above the center stack. In front of the driver, there was a TFT inside the instrument cluster. Behind the front seats, Lexus offered a few choices with up to five seats on two rows or just two reclining captain seats. These benefited from ample legroom and headroom. Powering this lounge on wheels was a 2.5-liter inline-four and an electric motor. The former moved the front wheels while the latter sent its torque to the rear axle when needed.",LEXUS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Lexus LM"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""premium minivan"",  ""overall-design"": [""roomy"", ""luxurious"", ""up-scale"", ""reworked"", ""spacious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""ginormous"", ""spindle""],    ""hood"": [""reworked""],    ""headlights"": [""slim"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""front-hinged"", ""sliding""],    ""roof"": [""top-mounted""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LEXUS RZ,"Toyota and Subaru joined forces and unveiled two new vehicles in 2021: the bZ4X and the Soltera, respectively. But Toyota also had a plan on a premium version of the two: the Lexus R450e. Like other Toyota products rebadged as Lexus, the R450e had to go through further testing before being greenlighted to get into production. Moreover, it had to show a different look to match the premium carmaker's design language. From the outside, the Z450e showed a spectacular reinterpretation of the spindle-design theme from the rest of the Lexus range, albeit it didn't sport the shiny, chromed mesh grille. Instead, it featured a unique apron design, with a lower-mounted grille crossed by three slats. The centerpiece was a gray element flanked on the upper side by the narrow, sharp-looking LED headlights. On the sides, the sculptured door panels and the up-kick part led to the broader shoulders above the rear wheels on the quarter-panels. The entire design language was named ""seamless E-motion"" by Lexus. The car sported a cockpit design inspired by the Tazuna concept, which means that the driver had to make the minimum effort to watch and control the vehicle. For that, the carmaker installed a head-up display and a 14"" multimedia screen atop the center stack. In addition, Lexus placed the controls for driving modes on the center console. Last but not least, the yoke that replaced the steering wheel was something unusual for this premium Japanese brand. Since the R450e was based on the same e-TNGA platform, it could offer the same powertrains as its siblings. Its battery pack consisted of 96 cells and delivered a total of 71.4 kWh of energy.",LEXUS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Lexus R450e"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""spectacular"", ""sculptured"", ""sharp-looking"", ""seamless""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""unique"", ""lower-mounted"", ""crossed"", ""three slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""narrow"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""apron design""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LEXUS UX,"The Lexus UX was already a best seller for the Japanese company and thus decided to release the electrified version of it, the UX 300e, at the Guangzhou Auto Show. Sure, the 300e is almost identical to the standard UX when it comes to the design, the small differences consisting of the new alloys and a lower stance. The big differences between the two were the charging port and what we could find under the hood. The 300e had an electrical engine that developed 201 hp and 300 Nm, powered by a 54,3 kWh battery. Lexus estimated an autonomy of 400 km, which made the UX 300e a good companion for long roads as well. Of course, the 400 km could be less or more, depending on the speed, weather conditions or the road itself. The battery could be fully recharged in 50 minutes (at 50kW). The EV dynamics are improved with the battery pack that’s been mounted low in the vehicle, thus moving the significant mass lower to the ground. While 150 kW might not sound like enough for the SUV, it actually weighs 1900 kg and with the instant torque delivery, the 300e had a smooth and compelling acceleration. The EV pretty much ticked all of the boxes, but there were still room for improvement in areas such as the trunk – a bit small compared to its rivals.",LEXUS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Lexus UX 300e"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""identical to standard UX"", ""new alloys"", ""lower stance""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""new alloys""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LIGHTYEAR Lightyear 0,"Lightyear introduced its first production vehicle, the 0 (Zero), in 2022 as a 2023 model-year as a stunning mobility solution based on solar power and electricity. While most automakers tried to create better or more energy-efficient battery packs, Lightyear came up with a different idea: to make a solar-powered EV. The concept wasn't new but previously was used only by specific races held in Australia or other parts of the world. But the automaker admitted that even if it was charged by the sun, its car still needed a battery pack and some motors to move the vehicle. This incredibly slippery vehicle featured a 0.19 drag resistance coefficient, which was stunning. At the front, it featured a slim grille needed to cool the electronic parts underneath the hood. But, to keep the streamlined vehicle energy efficient, it also sported active shutters in the lower bumper. The 0 also was fitted exclusively with LEDs for headlights, fog lamps, and blinkers. Since the car needed solar panels to charge the batteries, it sported 782 of them on the hood, roof, and rear deck. Inside, Lightyear used only vegan and naturally-sourced materials such as microfiber suede for seats and rattan palm trims. Since the 0 didn't have any door mirrors but cameras, it featured displays mounted inside the vehicle on the door panels. Atop the center stack, the automaker placed a 10.1"" infotainment touchscreen while the driver fronted a second display that showed speed and other essential information from the onboard computer. There were five seats inside the vehicle, with two at the front and a bench profiled for three adults in the back. Underneath the car's skin, Lightyear installed a 66 kWh battery pack that powered the four motors installed in the wheel. While it wasn't the fastest or the quickest electric vehicle, it offered excellent efficiency.",LIGHTYEAR,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""0 (Zero)"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""slippery, streamlined"",  ""overall-design"": [""solar-powered"", ""energy-efficient"", ""slim"", ""vegan"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""slim"", ""functional""],    ""hood"": [""solar-panel-fitted""],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""active-shutters""],    ""wheel"": [""motor-installed""],    ""doors"": [""mirrorless"", ""camera-equipped""],    ""roof"": [""solar-panel-fitted""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LIGHTYEAR Lightyear 2,"This car promised to offer months of driving without needing a recharge from any kind of power outlet since its batteries were charged by the mighty Sun. After launching the Lightyear 0, the automaker put its second product, the 2, behind a wall made from wood beams at the 2023 Consumers and Electronic Show. It also organized an online event where it talked about the future of this EV. But things went south quite fast, and less than a month later, the company that produced it filed for bankruptcy. Created as an affordable EV with solar panels on its hood, roof, and tailgate, the Lightyear 2 offered an aerodynamic shape that allowed it to run efficiently. Still, unlike the 0, it didn't feature half-covered rear wheels. Its LED headlights from the front fascia were slim and slightly stretched outward. The hatchback shape of the vehicle was needed to create a lower drag coefficient, and the door handles were retractable. Apart from the solar panels, the battery pack could've been recharged from a regular power outlet as well. The design team created the vehicle with sustainable materials on the interior. It used recycled PETs from plastic bottles and fibers from fast-growing trees. On top of the center stack, the automaker installed a touchscreen for the infotainment system. Since it was created as a family vehicle, it featured a set of bucket seats at the front and a bench for three in the back. Unfortunately, the automaker filed for bankruptcy, and the Lightyear 2 remained just a project, waiting for some other investor to come and pick it up from where it was left. In February 2023, such an investor appeared, and the hopes for those who enlisted themselves on the waiting list were re-ignited.",LIGHTYEAR,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Lightyear 2"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact hatchback"",  ""overall-design"": [""aerodynamic"", ""sustainable"", ""slim"", ""efficient"", ""retractable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""slim""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""solar-paneled""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""slim"", ""stretched""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""half-covered rear""],    ""doors"": [""hatchback"", ""retractable handles""],    ""roof"": [""solar-paneled""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LINCOLN Nautilus,"Lincoln introduced the Nautilus nameplate on its inventory in 2019 as a successor to the MKX lineup, but if that was more of a facelift, the 2024 model-year was an entirely new vehicle. The American premium brand's engineers burned the midnight oil when they did the new model and left no stone unturned to create an immersive experience for its customers. These were not just PR words but facts that proved the evolution that Lincoln had made. Besides the car's exterior, which was not exactly spectacular, the cabin itself was a completely different experience unseen on any other product this carmaker has ever done before. This mid-size SUV showed an improved look for the front fascia, which resembled the one installed on its bigger brother, the Navigator. It boasted a broad black grille adorned by a crosshair-style trim and flanked by slim LED headlights. They were underlined by a light strip that crossed the car from side to side. On the profile, the SUV stance was unmistakable and emphasized even more by the two-tone bodywork available as an option. At the back, the slightly tilted forward tailgate adorned by a roof spoiler resembled some luxurious British SUVs. But it was the interior that blew everybody's minds. The dashboard was separated into two areas: one placed at the bottom of the windshield and the next step closer to the passengers. The former one consisted of two wide screens that covered the entire length of the dash. In front of the driver was a configurable instrument panel, while the other half was reserved for the configurable infotainment system. In addition, a touchscreen placed atop the center stack controlled both areas. Like all Lincoln SUVs, this one also featured comfortable chairs at the front and a luxurious split-folding benchseat in the back. Powering this elegant vehicle was either a 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline engine or a hybrid system. The former version sent the power in all corners via an eight-speed automatic gearbox, while the latter was mated to a CVT.",LINCOLN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Nautilus"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""immersive"", ""improved"", ""luxurious"", ""elegant""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""broad"", ""tilted""],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""black"", ""crosshair-style""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""slim"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""two-tone""],    ""doors"": [""luxurious""],    ""roof"": [""spoiler"", ""luxurious""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LINCOLN Corsair,"Lincoln introduced a facelifted version for its mid-sized SUV lineup, the Corsair, and offered similar amenities as in its bigger sibling, the Navigator. Based on the same platform as the Ford Kuga, the 2023 Corsair came on the market in late 2022 with essential updates on most aspects. Moreover, it started to show that finally, the American brand found an intelligent direction for the Corsair. With similar external dimensions, albeit a little longer, the 2023 Corsair sported a new front fascia that received a broader grille adorned with a 3D pattern. In addition, a keen eye for details could've spotted the small Lincoln badge shapes on that grille. The new LED headlights incorporated the Lincoln name inside them, and lower on the bumper, the carmaker placed the blinkers. From its profile, depending on the options, the carmaker added many piano-black finishes on the door mirrors, pillars, and even wheels. Inside, the carmaker introduced a new set of seats that provided a more comfortable ride for passengers. Atop the center stack, Lincoln placed a 13.2"" touch-screen display for the infotainment system that featured wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Above the passengers, a panoramic glass roof was available as an option, and it could've been opened to allow more fresh air into the cabin. Under the hood, Lincoln followed the downsizing trend dropping the former 2.3-liter turbocharged powerplant with a smaller, 2.0-liter unit that was also turbocharged. Like its non-facelifted version, though, the 2023 Corsair was available with either a front- or an all-wheel drive system.",LINCOLN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Corsair"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""mid-sized SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""modern"", ""elegant"", ""refined"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""broader"", ""3D-patterned""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""incorporated Lincoln name""],    ""bumper"": [""lower blinkers""],    ""wheel"": [""piano-black finishes""],    ""doors"": [""piano-black finishes""],    ""roof"": [""panoramic glass""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LINCOLN MKC,"The last generation of the premium crossover SUV Lincoln MKC was released in 2019. One of the most noticeable improvements was part of the exterior design. The split-wing grille was replaced by the brand’s newest model used with the Lincoln Navigator. This change gave the MKC a classier look than before. Inside, the MKC featured an upgraded infotainment system, the Sync 3. While the instrument panel’s design looked a bit dated, it was easy to read. For 2019, the Lincoln MKC was available in four trim levels: Base, Select, Reserve and Black Label. The base trim level was well-loaded with 18-inch alloys, automatic LED headlights, a power liftgate, heated exterior mirrors, parking sensors, a rear-view camera, keyless entry and keyless go, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery, heated front seats and drive-seat memory functions. With the base trim level, the MKC featured standard technology features that included Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth connectivity, 4G LTE and a Wi-Fi Hotspot, 2 USB ports an a 9-speaker audio system. With the select trim level, the MKC came with more convenience features such as ambient interior lighting, upgraded leather upholstery and others. Moving to the Reserve trim, the featured included those of the Selet. And extra hands-free liftgate, as well as ventilated front seats. Optional 19-inch and 20-inch were available. The top-of-the-range, the Black Label trim level added to the Reserve equipment adaptive suspension dampers, distinct leather upholstery, different leather interior accents, a suede headliner and special color choices.

LINCOLN Navigator,"The biggest Lincoln on the market was the Navigator. And if the normal-sized Navigator was not enough, there was a long-wheelbase version. Both of them were able to carry up to 8 people inside. While the Lincoln Navigator was often named a re-badged Ford Expedition, the 2018 Navigator was built to cut that impression, even though it sits on the same platform as the blue-oval parent company model. The biggest difference is on the image and on its luxurious features that could make other premium car-makers to run back to the drawing board. Both versions were built upon a Ford F-Series chassis and the longer version was on a heavy-duty one. The size of a Navigator was expressed especially by its front chromed massive grille with a mesh-look design. The big and wide headlights with their LED running lights also made the car look larger. The automatic retractable sidestep was still offered as an option, for easier access in the vehicle. Inside, the Navigator was offered three rows of seats and up to eight passengers seating. While the rear row was good for accommodating thee passengers, the middle one was offered with two or three seats. For the driver, the seat had up to 30 ways of adjustments, including a left-right mode for hip-support. The instrument cluster was a 12” TFT screen. For the infotainment system, a 10” touch-screen was installed. Under the hood, the Lincoln Continental was fitted with only one engine option: a twin-turbo 3.5-liter V6 engine. It offered 450 hp and was mated to a standard 10-speed automatic co-developed with GM.",LINCOLN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Navigator"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""big, wide"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""massive grille"", ""wide headlights"", ""mesh-look design"", ""automatic retractable sidestep""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""chromed"", ""massive"", ""mesh-look""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""big"", ""wide"", ""LED running lights""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LINCOLN Navigator L,"Lincoln introduced the fourth generation of the Navigator at the 2017 New York Auto Show. It was based on the same chassis as the Ford Expedition, but with more features and luxury items. Ford's luxury brand, Lincoln, found that some customers were not satisfied with a regular 4x4 vehicle. They asked for more, and just a piece of leather on the seats and the automatic climate control was not enough for them. Mercedes-Benz and BMW already offered the ML and the X5, but the American brands struggled to keep up with the Europeans. The Navigator and the Cadillac Escalade were the first of their kind. The former was introduced in 1997 and, by 2017, it reached the fourth generation. Designed on the same chassis as the Ford Expedition and the F150, the Navigator surprised the market with its new design language. The massive grille featured a 3D design instead of the formerly used design system with horizontal slats. The designers installed air intakes for the bumper to cool the brakes and a lower grille for the AC-compressor. The vertical tailgate and the continuous red-light strip across the rear panel made an impressive appearance in the back. Inside, the Navigator used the same dashboard as the Lincoln Continental. The high-tech elements and the floating design for the infotainment screen amplified the luxurious feeling of the vehicle. It was interesting that the designers didn't fit the screen inside the center stack and installed it on top of it. Like the previous generations, the Navigator was available in two wheelbases and room for up to eight passengers. Another novelty for the car was the 12"" digital instrument cluster.",LINCOLN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Navigator"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""massive"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""high-tech"", ""impressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""3D""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""air-intakes"", ""cooling"", ""lower""],    ""wheel"": [""two wheelbases""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LINCOLN MKZ,"Lincoln refreshed the second generation of the MKZ for the 2017 model year, and the automaker completely changed the former minimalist interior that made it stand out from the crowd. The luxurious sedan was unveiled in late 2016 at the Los Angeles Auto Show, and compared to its non-facelifted version, it looked like a completely different vehicle. Nevertheless, Ford tried to impress and get a bigger slice of the mid-size sedan premium market, and not only that it offered the vehicle an upgraded aesthetic, but it also made some changes on the technical side. Lincoln ditched the former wing-style look of the front fascia and installed a mesh grille that sported the automaker's badge in the middle. It was flanked by redesigned headlights with a less swept-back look than on the 2013 model. In addition, the carmaker offered an option for LEDs, drastically improving nighttime illumination. Inside, the automaker listened to what customers said about the 2013 model and replaced the formerly used sliding touch sensors for most commands with regular dials. Truth be told, those touch screens only look good in pictures, but they are a nightmare to use in daily driving situations. Still, it kept the buttons for the gear selector on the driver's side of the center stack. One of its main advantages over its competitors was the sliding panoramic roof. Under the hood, Lincoln installed a completely new turbocharged V6 that replaced the previously used 3.7-liter naturally aspirated unit. Also, for base versions, a 2.0-liter inline-four was available. Both front or all-wheel drive options were on the list.",LINCOLN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""MKZ"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""mid-size sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""upgraded"", ""aesthetic"", ""refreshed"", ""impressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""mesh"", ""sporty""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""redesigned"", ""LED option"", ""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sliding touch sensors replaced"", ""buttons for gear selector""],    ""roof"": [""sliding panoramic""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LINCOLN MKT,"The 2013 Lincoln MKT was an evolution of the initial, 2010 model, with new features and new design changes to enhance the vehicle as a mid-life refresh. The Lincoln SUV lineup was enhanced once more for 2013 and, even if it was based on the Ford Edge's platform, it featured amenities that were unique to the luxury American brand. The three seating rows were covered with leather and the overall interior appearance was dominated by luxurious items. The most notable differences were at the grille, which was redesigned. Another feature that increased the comfort and the airy feeling inside the cabin was the fixed-class panoramic roof. The interior was heavily modified. It could be configured as a 6 or 7 seating position, with middle row individual seats or a bench. The second-row seats could also be heated and cooled. The second-row refrigerator (integrated into the center console) remained a popular option. The all-new instrumentation featured a central speedometer flanked by two full-color LCD screens. The 4.2-inch LCD screens were controlled by five-way buttons on the steering wheel. The 8-inch multi-function LCD touch screen dominated the center stack and provided the visual and control interface for the entertainment system, phone, navigation, and climate control. The standard engine for 2013 was a more powerful and efficient 3.7-liter V6, which offered an increased power to 300 from 268. The standard transmission was a 6-speed automatic.",LINCOLN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Lincoln MKT"",  ""year"": ""2013"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""comfortable"", ""powerful"", ""efficient""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""redesigned""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""panoramic""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LINCOLN Zephyr,"Lincoln introduced the locally built Zephir on the Chinese market in November 2021, and the Premium brand focused on a fluid design and advanced technologies. While it was not available to U.S. customers, the Zephir was already a known nameplate on the Chinese market. Its customers appreciated it thanks to the stylish design and the fluid lines that composed it. Even though it was penned in California, the Chinese designers brought some help and inputs. The car's longitudinal lines created the image of a longer vehicle, and its overall shape might resemble the European Ford Mondeo. Yet, the front fascia featured a 3D mesh design crossed by a chromed slat that supported the narrow, vertical Lincoln badge. Its profile revealed a three-windows setup, with an additional glass area behind the rear doors, while at the back, the designers placed a wide light strip with the ""Lincoln"" text embedded that crossed the trunk's lid. The rear skirt concealed the exhausts. Inside, Ford placed a 12.3"" digital dashboard instrument panel embedded into a 27"" (69 cm) wide touchscreen. The carmaker installed the Chinese-only 4 SYNC+ infotainment system, which enabled continuous OTA updates. Another luxurious feel was provided by the 128-color ambient light and specific scents sent inside the cockpit through the air vents.

LINCOLN Aviator,"Lincoln first offered the Aviator nameplate on a large three-row SUV back in the early 2000s, but the model's lack of success saw it being taken out of production after less than four years on the market. More than a decade later, Lincoln realized that it's so infatuated with the Aviator moniker that it developed a brand new SUV to wear it once more. Just like its predecessor, the all-new Aviator is a mid-sized three-row SUV that sits right under the Navigator in the Lincoln modern SUV lineup. While naturally aspirated V8s were a commonality on American mid-size and full-size SUVs in the early 2000s, the second-generation Lincoln Aviator has an engine lineup that only comprises twin-turbocharged six-cylinders. The entry level model is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 with 400 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque, sent to all four wheels through a 10-speed automatic transmission developed in-house by Ford. The top of the range model is a plug-in hybrid version that gets its own nomenclature (Aviator Grand Touring), and comes with 450 horsepower and no less than 600 lb-ft of torque while using a lot less fuel than the standard model. While the model's exterior follows the same design language as its bigger brother, the Navigator, but with more aeronautical influences, the interior has its own style.",LINCOLN,"{  ""car-model"": ""Lincoln Aviator"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""mid-sized three-row SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""aeronautical"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""bold""],    ""hood"": [""sculpted""],    ""headlights"": [""sleek""],    ""bumper"": [""streamlined""],    ""wheel"": [""large""],    ""doors"": [""elegant""],    ""roof"": [""sleek""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}"
LINCOLN Continental,"Ford's luxury brand Lincoln returned on the market with the Continental name, after dropping the three-letter style that was adopted for several years and, in 2016, it introduced its new flagship. The Continental name was out of the market for 14 years, but the market didn't forget it. It was the tenth generation and it offered more than any Lincoln before in terms of technology. It didn't feature the biggest engine, but it was the most powerful up to 2016. One major component of the car was the stance. The tenth generation of the Continental featured a big chromed grille and LED headlights in the front. It didn't have an aggressive styling, but a dominant stance on the road. The three box-sedan was designed with curved and ample lines. The door handles were on a chromed line along with the bodywork and they featured a switch to open the door. Inside, the luxury interior was designed to match the European competition. The front seats had up to 30 power adjustable ways, including the sides, the hips, the headrest, the upper side, and so on. The infotainment touch-screen was installed on the center stack. The center console resembled an airplane cockpit, but with fewer buttons on it. The instrument cluster was completely digital, with a TFT screen. Under the hood, there was a choice of engines ranging up to 400 hp from a twin-turbo V6 unit. The all-wheel-drive system was standard for the top of the range model and offered as an option for the less-powered versions.",LINCOLN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Lincoln Continental"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""big"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxury"", ""dominant stance"", ""curved lines"", ""ample lines"", ""European-inspired interior""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""big"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""chromed"", ""power adjustable""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
LOTUS Emira,"Lotus introduced the Emira in 2021 as its last vehicle fitted with an internal combustion engine. It even announced its EV architecture a few weeks after the car’s presentation. Built on the legacy of its appreciated predecessors such as Elise, Exige, and Evora, the Emira was a final statement about the famous British carmaker. It was like a beacon for everything achieved by the carmaker until then. Moreover, it was the first cooperation between Lotus and AMG, where the German company supplied the inline-four engines for the Emira. With its sleek, aerodynamic design, the Emira looked like a supercar, except that it cost half of a well-equipped Porsche 911. Its fluid lines and the two wide cuts on the front trunk lid offered a unique image in the supercar segment. Those vents were used to divert the air gathered by the front-grille-mounted on the apron. A pair of side-scoops were used for venting the front disc brakes. On its sides, the short, arched greenhouse was ended on a long sloped deck over the engine compartment, which was in the middle. Wide, sculptured air-intakes mounted on the rear fenders gathered the air needed to cool the engine. Inside, Lotus installed two sport bucket seats. The 12.3” digital instrument cluster showed all the car’s functions and was customizable depending on the driving mode. Above the center stack, an additional 10.25” touch-screen showed the info for the infotainment system, which also included the navigation. Inside the engine compartment, Lotus offered a choice of two engines. The most potent version was a supercharged 3.5-liter V6 based on an engine block supplied by Toyota. The other option was the turbocharged two-liter four-pot unit provided by AMG.",LOTUS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Emira"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""aerodynamic"", ""fluid"", ""sculptured"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""front-mounted""],    ""hood"": [""wide"", ""vented""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""wide""],    ""doors"": [""short""],    ""roof"": [""arched"", ""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""rear-mounted""]  }}```"
LOTUS Elise,"After a few other final editions, Lotus decided to retire the Elise in a true Final Edition roadster that added a few extra ponies and added some changes to the car's look both in and outside. It might be hard to imagine how the Elise survived on the market for a quarter of a century. It was revealed in 1996, and it went through constant upgrades over time, but in essence, it remained the same bare-chassis sports car. It was the car that saved the Lotus brand and made it great again. No pun intended. The major changes were for the colors from the outside, which evoked the original paint schemes of the original, 1996, Elise. Lotus offered the Final Edition 240 in Azure Blue, Black, and Racing Green. As a statement for the final 2021 edition, Lotus added ""Final Edition 240 Sport"" decals on the front fenders. There was no massive rear wing in the back. Inside, the biggest change was the TFT instrument panel that replaced the analog dials. It featured a two-screen display, one for regular street use and another one for racing, on the tracks. A thick and slightly wider steering wheel clad in leather and Alcantara helped the driver to keep the car under control via the unassisted steering. Between the seats, the carmaker left the gear-box linkages exposed as a spectacular metallic sculpture. The engine was the same 1.8-liter supercharged four-mill tuned to provide 240 hp. Yes, the Final Edition Sport 240 was heavier than the original 1996 Elise, but it was still a light sports car by any means, and the engine was there just to push it from one corner to another.",LOTUS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Elise"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""light sports car"",  ""overall-design"": [""retro-inspired"", ""sporty"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""subtle"", ""curved""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""absent""],    ""exhaust"": [""standard""]  }}```"
LOTUS Exige,"Lotus considered that a special car needed a unique, final edition, and it proved that with the introduction of the Exige Sport 420 Final Edition at the beginning of 2021. After 21 years since the start of the Exige series, Lotus regained its past glory. It started with the Elise and continued with its coupe cousin, the Exige. Over time, the two vehicles shared many of their components and increased Lotus' value on a market that almost forgot the former British glorious brand that stunned the Formula One world. At the front, the Exige kept its four-headlights design with clear glass over them. A special bumper with an integrated center grille and two side pods increased the aerodynamic downforce. On the front fenders, the carmaker installed specific stickers that marked the last Exiges. Regardless of the car's color, ell the 420 Special Editions featured a black roof. A black wing mounted on the back panel kept the car planted during fast cornering. Inside, the carmaker installed race bucket-seats with race-harness. They were upholstered in Alcantara and red, contrast stitches. The steering wheel was thicker and wrapped in Alcantara as well, and the same material was used for the door panels. For the instrument cluster, Lotus installed a TFT display with a choice of two screens: one with regular dials and the other with race-type information. Lotus installed a re-tuned V-6 engine in the 420 Final Edition that provided 420 hp. It was the fastest Exige ever made, with a top speed of 180 mph (295 kph). It could rocket from 0 to 60 mph in 3.3 seconds.",LOTUS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Exige Sport 420 Final Edition"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""unique"", ""aerodynamic"", ""fast"", ""sporty"", ""aggressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""clear glass""],    ""grille"": [""integrated"", ""center""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""four-headlights"", ""clear glass""],    ""bumper"": [""special"", ""aerodynamic"", ""integrated""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""race-style""],    ""roof"": [""black""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""black"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""exhaust"": [""re-tuned"", ""V-6"", ""powerful""]  }}```"
LOTUS Evora,"The British car-manufacturer Lotus has revealed a new supercar built for the public roads but with even greater abilities on the track: the Evora GT. Lotus was always connected to the high-performance and nimble cars. For a long time, it wasn't that important on the market anymore, until it revealed the Elise, the car that changed everything. Its basic principles of light vehicle and powerful engines worked very well, especially for those who were heading down the racetrack for weekend races. Based on the already known Lotus Evora, the GT version was introduced in 2019 as a 2020 model. The GT was based on the Evora 4. First of all, the GT is lighter than the 400. One of the reasons is that it was available with 2, or 2+2 seating configuration. An expensive Carbon Pack was included on the options list and that shaved up to 100 lbs (45 kg) from the vehicle weight. The new carbon-fiber body panels also added aerodynamic downforce for improved high-speed cornering grip. Inside, the GT letters are embroiled in the seatbacks just to remember that it was the GT version. On the center console, in front of the gear-stick, there were the climate control rotary knobs that looked like those used for radio-communication in a race-car. In the middle of the dashboard, an Alpine infotainment unit with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity was installed. The engine was the same supercharged 3.5-liter from Toyota that was installed on the Evora 400. It was tweaked to produce more power. The transmission was made via a 6-speed manual gearbox and a Torsen limited-slip differential.",LOTUS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Evora GT"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""Lightweight"",  ""overall-design"": [""High-performance"", ""Nimble"", ""Aerodynamic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""Carbon-fiber"", ""Aerodynamic""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""2-seater"", ""2+2 seating""],    ""roof"": [""Carbon-fiber""],    ""diffusor"": [""Aerodynamic""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""Supercharged""]  }}```"
LOTUS Eletre,"Lotus took a decisive step and entered the SUV territory in 2022 with the Eletre, which was called a Hyper-SUV thanks to its attributes and brand's heritage, even though it was an overstatement. Even though it wasn't built in Warwickshire, UK, but in China, it still benefited from the British company's know-how in terms of design and engineering. From the outside, its hood resembled the one seen on the Elise, but that was the only resemblance with other sports cars made by Lotus. On the front fascia, the Eletre featured two side scoops that flanked the black grille and sported the daytime running lights. From its sides, the muscular appearance showed flared wheel arches and an exhaust vent behind the front wheel-fenders. A waved-shaped beltline adorned the side above the retractable door handles. At the back, the carmaker installed a raked-forward windscreen and an unusual shape for the tailgate, with a red light strip crossing it from side to side. A set of 23"" light-alloy wheels completed the high-performance look of the car. Inside, if the carmaker wished to create a minimalist interior, it didn't quite succeed. The dashboard featured two screens, one in front of the driver and the other one on the passenger side, and a bigger, 15.1"" touchscreen on the center stack. In addition, a head-up display with AR (Augmented Reality) was shown in front of the driver. While all of Eletre's elements were digitally controlled, some key features were doubled with regular switches. As expected, it offered room for four adult passengers on individual bucket seats. The combined luggage space (frunk and trunk) of the car was 470 liters (16.6 cu-ft). Built on a dedicated 800 volts platform, the Eletre was powered by two electric motors, one for each axle, which offered a total output of 592 hp (600 PS).",LOTUS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Eletre"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""Muscular"",  ""overall-design"": [""Muscular"", ""High-performance"", ""Unusual"", ""Minimalist"", ""Digitally controlled""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""Raked-forward""],    ""grille"": [""Black""],    ""hood"": [""Resembled Elise's""],    ""headlights"": [""Daytime running""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""Flared"", ""23\"" light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [""Retractable handles""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""Vent behind front wheel-fenders""]  }}```"
LOTUS Evija,"The first mainstream electric car in the world was based on a Lotus chassis: the Tesla Roadster. Now, Lotus launches its first full-electric supercar. And when Lotus says supercar, it means it. The new Evija can put Tesla's models into a risky situation on the drag-strip. Lotus is the only British car-manufacturer that was concerned only about sports cars or, as a compromise, fast cars. Now it has returned on the market with the new Evija supercar. A car built with motorsport heritage and racing technologies. Inside, there are a lot of aircraft-inspired controls. The steering wheel is not quite a wheel. It is more like a rectangle with buttons. Lots of buttons. On the center console, there is a bar with lots of buttons for various functions of the vehicle. But, the most important things are on the performance side. The Evija features four 500 hp electric motors, each mounted transversally on the front and rear axles of the car. They are monitored and controlled by computers. In total, they are producing a massive 1700 Nm (1,253 lb-ft) of torque. The engines are powered by a battery pack supplied by Williams Advanced Engineering as a part of a joint-venture with Lotus on advanced propulsion technologies. It has a 2000 kWh capacity and it can ensure a WLTP range of 400 km (250 miles). The sprint from 0 to 62 mph (100 kph) takes less than three seconds, 62-125 mph (100-200 kph) takes another three seconds and the 124-186 mph (200-300 kph) sprint is achieved in another four seconds. The maximum speed is 211 mph (340 kph).",LOTUS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Evija"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""electric"", ""aerodynamic"", ""high-performance"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""sleek""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""high-performance""],    ""doors"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""roof"": [""modern""],    ""diffusor"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""spoiler"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""exhaust"": [""electric""]  }}```"
LOTUS 3 Eleven,"There were only 20 cars made from the quickest ever (to that time) Lotus road car: the 3-Eleven 430. There were 311 cars made by Lotus and the 430 meant the power output. It sounds like a cliche, but the Lotus 3-Eleven was a race-car adapted for road use. The car was available in two versions: track and road. For road use, the manufacturer installed hand-made turn signals. The 3-Eleven 430 featured a bodywork without windshield or any sort of windows. It didn't have any doors either. But it was available with two race-bucket seats, made out of carbon-fiber to reduce weight. The racing steering wheel was removable and the seat belts were actual 6-point race harnesses. A big wing in the back was added for more downforce. Along with the front splitter, it could add up to 285 kg (628 lbs) of aerodynamic weight. Inside the car, the driver had a fully digital instrument cluster which could show different parameters for race use. There were only a few buttons on a separate panel: stationary lights, headlights, high-beam, Engine start, hazard lights, and kill-switch. On the left side of the steering column, there was the turn-signal command. The car was built for race-tracks. It didn't have any sound deadening. The carbon-fiber bodywork had some elements painted, but most of it was left unpainted. The mid-engine was a supercharged 3.5-liter V6 from Toyota. It was available with a 6-speed manual for road version or a 6-speed sequential for the track. The limited-slip differential was a good enhancement since the car weighted only 920 kg (2028 lbs). It was a track car that could handle 1.5 g whilst cornering.",LOTUS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Lotus 3-Eleven 430"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""small, lightweight"",  ""overall-design"": [""race-car adapted for road use"", ""track-focused""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""absent""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""carbon-fiber""],    ""headlights"": [""hand-made turn signals""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""race-bucket seats"", ""carbon-fiber construction""],    ""doors"": [""absent""],    ""roof"": [""absent""],    ""diffusor"": [""big wing for downforce"", ""front splitter for aerodynamics""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""mid-engine"", ""supercharged V6""]  }}```"
LOTUS Emeya,"Lotus needed more than three decades to launch a new go-fast four-door sedan on the market, and when it did, the new model had a lower top speed than its predecessor, but it was electric. In the late '80s, Lotus was owned by GM, and the American automaker pushed the British car manufacturer to create a super-sedan based on a mundane family car made by Vauxhall and Opel in Europe, the Vauxhall Carlton/Opel Omega. The result was an amazing four-door sports sedan that could get up to 176 MPH (283 kph) and did the 0 to 60 MPH (0-97 kph) run in a mere 5.2 seconds. That happened in 1990, and the car was produced for just two years. After that, Lotus never made another sedan until 2023, when it made the Emeya GT. But this time, it was completely different. The car was made on a Lotus-owned platform that was not shared with a regular sedan. Lotus developed the Emeya to be a contender in the fast-growing super-sedans market. Its design was made in-house, and the car looked like it wanted to break speed records. At the front, there were two pairs of slim LED headlights above the bumper. Underneath them, the automaker installed the side scoops that improved the car's aerodynamics and cooled the front rotors as well. A trapezoidal air intake took center stage in the air dam, creating an even more aggressive look for the vehicle. From its profile, the curved lines of the bodywork and greenhouse looked similar to those from the Lotus Eletre, the company's first SUV. At the back, the sloped-down rear windscreen and the short rear deck emphasized the car's dynamic look. One particular detail of this car was that it didn't have door mirrors. Inside, the automaker created a minimalist design for the cabin with a straight dashboard. Lotus installed a small digital instrument cluster in front of the driver with a small visor above it, while a landscape-mode touchscreen covered the area for the center stack. Two additional screens showed the images from the exterior side-mounted cameras that replaced the door mirrors. Like any other Lotus, the Emeya featured a pair of sports seats at the front. These featured high-bolstered areas to keep their occupants in place during high-speed cornering maneuvers. Between them, the automaker mounted a center console that housed the buttons for drive modes and a pair of cup holders. In the back, the Emeya featured two individual sports seats for their occupants. Lotus installed two motors to power the car, one for each axle. While the one from the front featured a single-speed, the one in the back was a two-speed one for increased energy efficiency at higher speeds. The electrical system used a 102 kWh battery pack that owners could replenish at 350 kW DC chargers. In around 18 minutes, the car could get up to 80% of the battery recharged, and it could get 93 miles (150 km) of range in around five minutes. As for the performance, Lotus limited the Emeya's top speed to 155 MPH (250 kph), which was slower than the Lotus Carlton. Still, the four-door electric super-sedan could reach 60 mph (97 kph) from zero in 2.8 seconds, about 2.4 seconds quicker than its gasoline-powered predecessor.",LOTUS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Emeya GT"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""four-door sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""electric"", ""aggressive"", ""dynamic"", ""minimalist"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""curved""],    ""headlights"": [""slim"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""trapezoidal""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""mirrorless""],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
Lucid Motors Air,"The new car-company from the Silicone-Valley launched a stunning car from many points of view: from the incredibly low drag-coefficient to the high performance, electric, drive system. After Tesla started to promote and sell its electric vehicles, more and more carmakers started to think if it is possible to build something the same, or better. Lucid air was one of them and its 2020 product brought new improvements and new technologies to make an electric car looks like it came from the future of the automobile. The slim front part of the car was carefully designed with a signature light band on the hood and the smallest headlights in the industry. They are less than an inch (25.4 mm) tall. The technology was developed in-house by Lucid engineers. The sleek profile of the car and led to a drag-coefficient of just CX 0.21, which was the lowest in the world. The trunk was a big clamshell in the rear and it allowed the introduction of wide items. The rear light ran uninterrupted across the trunk lid. Due to its long wheelbase and low profile, the car offered a spacious interior. The batteries were mounted in the center tunnel, rocker panels, and the floor. For the dashboard, a 34” curved-glass display showed the information in a 5k resolution. An additional display was retractable from the center stack, for both front passengers. The Lucid air technology for the batteries was tested in over ten years and over 20 million miles of real-world testing. The Air was offered in three versions: the Air, the Touring, and the Grand Touring. The top of the line version featured a 1080 hp electric motor which ran a quarter-mile (402 m) in 9.9 seconds.",Lucid Motors,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Lucid Air"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""long wheelbase, low profile"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""futuristic"", ""spacious"", ""innovative"", ""high-performance""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sleek""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""slim"", ""signature"", ""light band""],    ""headlights"": [""small"", ""less than an inch tall""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""wide""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""big clamshell in the rear""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
Mahindra Thar,"The Indian producer Mahindra designed the Mahindra Thar for the people in the countryside, thus tried their best to suit their needs with the impressive off-road capabilities and the affordable price, the That being one of the most affordable SUV. The That was launched in 2010 as a replacement for the MM540 model and the new design made it look like an older Jeep. The classic ladder frame the car was built on was optimised for better handling. The Thar was equipped with a 2.5-liter common rail engine developing 106 hp. The exterior design of the Thar was square-shaped and minimalist, just as Mahindra described it: “less is more”. The big tyres completed the look, but it was not the looks that were the most important. The tyres, along with the 200mm ground clearance and the independent suspension gave the Thar incredible heavy duty off-road capabilities. The interior was nothing more than basic, with a heater, instrument cluster gauges, door lock, gear knob and the lever switching to 4x4. The seats were not very comfortable either. The SUV could reach 150 kph, but it was very unlikely for a car designed for off-road purposes to feel good at those speeds. Surprisingly, the Thar had no roof.

Mahindra Bolero,"Mahindra launched the Bolero in 2001, and its rugged construction helped it gain an important part of the market. One decade later, the Indian carmaker improved the car. Mahindra & Mahindra was a big carmaker, especially known for its off-road vehicles. The Bolero was one of the vehicles of choice used by the Indian Police and armed forces. The simple body-on-frame construction and simple engineering solutions made it suitable for hard situations. From the outside, the Bolero featured a boxy-looking design, with flat door panels and fenders. The entire vehicle looked like it was built from flat sheets of plywood. The 2011 model featured new headlights, which looked more aggressive and wide. On the bumper, the designer installed two fog-lights, which were available on upper trim levels. From its sides, the exposed door-hinges looked rough. The interior was surprisingly roomy for a 4.1 meter (13.47 ft) vehicle. It could accommodate up to seven passengers inside, with two jump-seats in the trunk. A simple dashboard with a handle for the front passenger and a digital panel inside the instrument cluster offered enough information for the driver. In the center stack, the designers embed the center vents and an aftermarket-looking CD-radio. Under the hood, Mahindra installed a diesel engine. It was naturally aspirated and offered a mere 63 hp from a 2.5-liter displacement but offered a start-stop system to save fuel.

Mahindra Scorpio / GOA,"Mahindra introduced Scorpio in 2002, and it was a new chapter in the history of the Indian car-maker. To drive on the backroads, dirt roads, and unpaved roads of India, the customers, required an off-road vehicle to move without problems and no issues. The Scorpio was the right answer, and it offered even more. With its rugged appearance, boxy body-on-frame construction, and flat front fascia, the Scorpio was the car of choice for the army, police, politicians, and wealthy people from India. It wasn't a cheap car for that market, but it was a trustworthy one. The chromed grille, big headlights, and flat surfaces made it easy to recognize either from the back or in the rearview mirror. The Mahindra Scorpio was sold in Europe with the Goa name since the Scorpio was already a trademark owned by Ford. Inside, the Scorpio offered up to eight seats. It featured cruise control, automatic air-conditioning, man-made leather upholstery, an infotainment unit with a sat-nav system, and a touchscreen on the center stack. Under the hood, the car-maker installed a base version with a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated diesel that offered 75 hp, the next in line was a 2.2-liter that provided 120 hp, and the top of the range 2.2-liter turbodiesel with 140 hp. Its main flaw was with the brake system that couldn't stop the vehicle as quickly as other car-makers from the same time.",Mahindra,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Scorpio"",  ""year"": ""2002"",  ""size"": ""rugged, boxy"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""boxy"", ""flat-front"", ""chromed"", ""recognizable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""chromed""],    ""hood"": [""flat""],    ""headlights"": [""big""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
Mahindra Verito,"It is the Indian version of the older Renault Logan. It was launched in 2007 in India and while in the rest of the world it has received new generations, in India the Verito remained pretty much the same. But, with the production patent in its pocket, Mahindra&Mahindra industry kept the old model into production as a cheap version for the masses, trying to replace the older national car called the Hindustan Ambassador, produced up until 2014 even if it was a patent after a 1950s Morris Oxford. The new Verito launched in 2012 showed some aging markings, but Mahindra managed to cover them up with new headlights and a two-tone dashboard. They also made a shorter variant, called the Verito Vibe. In South America and in Europe, Renault launched a new generation of the Renault Logan, but in India, Mahindra kept the same vehicle from the first generation. It has only one engine, a 1.5-liter turbodiesel with 64 hp. Mahindra also managed to make an electric version with the eVerito, the first Indian electric sedan. It has a 31 kW motor and a 21.2 kWh li-ion battery. These are enough for a 181 km (112 miles) range. Top speed is a mere 80 kph (50mph) and the charging time from 0 to 100% is claimed to take 11 hours and 30 minutes (give or take 15 minutes as they say), or 1h30 minutes from 0 to 80%.",Mahindra,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Verito"",  ""year"": ""2007"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""cheap"", ""aging"", ""two-tone""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""shorter""],    ""headlights"": [""new""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MARUTI SUZUKI Swift,"The partnership between the Indian company Maruti and the Japanese car-maker Suzuki led to more vehicles built in India, among them the second generation of the Swift. Unlike other cars licensed by the Indian company, the 2006 Maruti was the same vehicle as the Suzuki Swift produced for Japan, Europe, or Australia. It was the most up-to-date car ever built in the two-decades history of the Indian manufacturer. The rounded shape of the little vehicle didn't make it looks like a bubble-car. Its sharp-cut headlights and straight lines of the grille formed an opposition to the vehicle's general lines. Due to its body-colored door-handles and door-mirrors, the car didn't look cheesy anymore, like its predecessor produced by Maruti in India, the 800. It even featured a small roof-spoiler on top of the tailgate. Inside, the Swift featured a modern design for the dashboard, even though the materials used were not the best in its segment. A complete instrument cluster with a tachometer, speedometer, coolant temperature, and fuel gauge, along with a small LCD, offered enough information for the driver. There was enough room inside for up to five passengers, although without too much legroom on the backseats. The small trunk could have been expanded due to the folding rear seatback. Under the hood, the Swift was powered by a 1.3-liter gasoline engine mated to a 5-speed manual gearbox. By 2007, Maruti sold 100.000 units before the Fiat's 1.3-liter diesel engine was added to the engine choice list.",MARUTI SUZUKI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Swift"",  ""year"": ""2006"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""rounded"", ""sharp-cut"", ""straight lines"", ""body-colored"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""straight lines""],    ""hood"": [""rounded""],    ""headlights"": [""sharp-cut""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""body-colored""],    ""roof"": [""small""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""small""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MARUTI SUZUKI 800,"Due to specific laws, carmakers who wanted to sell vehicles in India had to produce them inside the country to avoid high import taxes. In the early '80s, Suzuki found Maruti as a local partner for assembling vehicles. The first generation of the Maruti Suzuki 800 appeared in 1983, followed by a second generation in 1986. Maruti, on the other hand, noticed that with some effort could export the vehicle to other markets. So in 2000 it started the production of an enhanced version of the 800's second generation. The car's design was the least concern of the Indian automaker, so the vehicle looked like a pile of bricks with rectangular headlights at the front and corner-mounted turn signals. In addition, Maruti added a set of signal repeaters on the front fenders. The flat surfaces were easy and cheap to build, and the metal sheets were produced in India and they were very thin, so the overall weight would be kept at a minimum. Despite the short length of the vehicle, it featured four doors and, on the sides, the 800 also sported a third window behind the rear doors. Finally, at the back, the car sported a flat, vertical tailgate. Inside, Maruti installed thin, low-mounted seats for the front passengers and a folding bench for the rear ones. Technically, it was homologated for five occupants, but there was hardly room for four. As for the trunk, that was enough for a briefcase and a sandwich. The dashboard was squared, and the instrument cluster that fronted the driver sported just a few dials for the speedometer, fuel level, and water temperature. Under the hood, Maruti used the license-built 800 cc engine provided by Suzuki. It was paired as standard to a five-speed manual.",MARUTI SUZUKI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Maruti Suzuki 800"",  ""year"": ""2000"",  ""size"": ""short"",  ""overall-design"": [""rectangular headlights"", ""flat surfaces"", ""thin metal sheets"", ""four doors"", ""vertical tailgate""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""flat""],    ""headlights"": [""rectangular""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""four""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MARUTI SUZUKI Gipsy,"To avoid India's high import taxes, Suzuki signed an agreement with the local carmaker Maruti and introduced the Gipsy model in 1985. The Indian government established the Maruti Udyog Ltd. In 1981 and, in the next year, it signed a contract with Suzuki to build cars in India. There was a high demand for cheap, sturdy, and trustworthy vehicles, and that's what the Japanese carmaker introduced on the assembly lines in 1985: the Maruti Suzuki Gipsy. It was a win-win situation, where the country started to build specific vehicles, and the Japanese carmaker started to make a profit from that. The Gipsy was entirely based on the Suzuki SJ-410, but with a very small difference: it sported the Maruti badge at the front. The round headlights and the black grille remained. Since the car had to be cheap and it was already a body-on-frame construction. The car was built on the long-wheelbase version and sported two doors and a canvas roof. Inside, apart from the Maruti badge on the steering wheel, the carmaker carried over everything else from the light Suzuki SJ. Apart from the two front seats, the car sported side benches in the car's rear side, where four other people could sit. Suzuki offered the Gipsy with a 1.0-liter engine paired to a four-speed manual. A transfer case with high and low gear was fitted as standard.",MARUTI SUZUKI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Gipsy"",  ""year"": ""1985"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""cheap"", ""sturdy"", ""trustworthy""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""round"", ""black""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""round""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""two doors"", ""long-wheelbase""],    ""doors"": [""two""],    ""roof"": [""canvas""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MARUTI SUZUKI Wagon R,"After signing an agreement with the Indian Government in the early '90s, Suzuki started producing cars in India in a joint-venture company with the local vehicle builder Maruti. Designed for narrow Japanese streets and crowded cities, the Wagon R fit like a glove for the Indian market. But the transition to an Indian version was not that easy as the carmaker hoped for. In the end, it managed to introduced it on the local market in 2005. At first, it wasn't that successful but later on, the sales started picking up. When Suzuki designed the Wagon R, it made it fit in the Japanese kei-car rules. In order to provide enough interior room, the carmaker made a flat front fascia and a short engine compartment. The steep windshield started the cabin's shape, which was continued by a flat roof and a vertical drop in the back for the liftgate. The interior was minimalist, with a two-level dashboard, which featured a lower shelf for both front passengers. To help the dealers, most of the stereo units were dealer installed from aftermarket suppliers. On the base trim level, there were four wind-up side windows and no air-conditioning. These two features were available only on the top trim level. Under the hood, Maruti-Suzuki offered the Wagon R with only one engine option. Thus, it managed to lower the production cost and shorten the construction times.",MARUTI SUZUKI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Wagon R"",  ""year"": ""2005"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""compact"", ""minimalist"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""steep""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""flat""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""wind-up side""],    ""roof"": [""flat""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MASERATI Ghibli,"The Maserati Ghibli's electrification marked a new beginning for the Italian brand, offering a powerful, yet ecological, version for its smallest four-door sedan. The four-door Maserati Ghibli was unveiled at the 2013 Shanghai Motor Show, and it was upgraded continuously both in terms of aesthetic and performance factors. In its quest to lower the emissions, Maserati dared to offer it with a turbodiesel engine as well. In 2020 it started to sell the Ghibli with a mild-hybrid powertrain that promised to increase its fuel-efficiency. The hybrid version of the Ghibli was visually different when compared to its brothers. The main ingredient was the light blue color that enhanced the side vents on the front fenders, the brake calipers, and the oval that enclosed the Trident on the C-pillar. The grille featured a different design with ten slats but curved as a trident fork (an instrument for tuning acoustic instruments). Inside, the Ghibli Hybrid was fitted with the best amenities available in the Maserati storage. The instrument cluster featured a TFT color display between the speedometer and the tachometer. The infotainment system featured a big touch-screen on the center stack. The interior door panels featured blue stitches, but the car's sporty character was not left aside, and carbon-fiber trims were installed on the center console. The powertrain consisted of a twin-turbo 2.0-liter engine and an electric motor. It was mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission.",MASERATI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Maserati Ghibli"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""four-door sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""powerful"", ""ecological"", ""aesthetic"", ""performance"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""different design"", ""ten slats"", ""curved""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""blue stitches""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MASERATI Levante,"With the introduction of the Levante Trofeo, Maserati jumped to the necks of the German SUVs that had the M, the AMG, or the SQ badges on them. 2020 was a difficult year for all the world due to the world pandemic situation, but Maserati decided to launch online its main four-door contenders: the Ghibli, the Quattroporte, and the Levante with a twin-turbo V8 Ferrari engine. Unlike the other siblings, the Levante was the only one available with an all-wheel-drive system. From the outside, the Levante didn't feature the same distinctive red trims as the Ghibli or the Quattroporte. It was more subtle, but some details could tell the difference. The front bumper and the rear apron were slightly modified. The wider air-intakes and the grille were specific for the Levante Trofeo. Inside, the Levante featured carbon fiber trims and, as an option, it could have been fitted with carbon-fiber paddle-shifters placed behind the steering wheel. On the center console, there was the gear selector and the buttons for the driving modes. The instrument cluster and the infotainment display were the same as on the Maserati Levante GTS. The carbon fiber trims were seen on the center console, the center stack, and on the dashboard as well. For the front occupants, a pair of bucket seats were installed. But the real update was on the technological side. A 3.8-liter V8 engine was placed under the hood and paired to an 8-speed automatic transmission. Power went in all four corners. For better control of the 580 hp, the Quattroporte Trofeo was fitted with an Integrated Vehicle Control (IVC) system, tuned for enhanced vehicle dynamics, and better active safety.",MASERATI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Levante Trofeo"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""subtle"", ""distinctive"", ""wide"", ""specific"", ""technological""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wider"", ""specific""],    ""hood"": [""modified""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""front"", ""rear"", ""modified"", ""wide""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""powerful""]  }}```"
MASERATI GranTurismo,"Maserati stopped the production of the GranTurismo lineup in 2019, but the Italian brand was already thinking of a replacement, albeit that one came in late 2022. The Italian automaker didn't rush to keep the former model on the assembly lines, especially during the pandemic years of 2020-2022. By the time it had decided to launch a successor for its beautiful coupe, the automotive industry had already started to shift towards the electric movement. Still, Maserati's name was closely linked to internal combustion engines, so it offered a few of them, such as the Granturismo Modena. Even though the ""Modena"" name was mostly linked to Maserati's owner, Ferrari, the trident-badge brand was allowed to use it. On the outside, the car showed a similar profile to the model it replaced. At the front, the LED headlights were no longer swept on the sides but upwards on the front fenders. The car's front fascia featured a fat bumper that sported the main grille surrounded by a chromed trim. Maserati's design team installed a black lip spoiler on the lower side, in the apron, and on the sides, a pair of air intakes that cooled the brakes. Following the carmaker's tradition, the three vents on the front fenders hinted at the six-cylinder under the hood. Inside, Maserati placed its bets on sportiness, luxury, and technology. Thus, the 2022 GranTurismo boasted a four-seat, leather-wrapped interior. At the front, the high-bolstered bucket seats were comfortable and offered enough side support for high-speed cornering. Finally, the dashboard blended the wood trims and the high-tech displays for the instrument cluster and the infotainment system, respectively, placed atop the center stack. Under the hood, Maserati installed the twin-turbocharged V6 powerplant developed by Ferrari. In the Modena version, this provided 490 PS (483 hp) sent to the rear wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission.",MASERATI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""GranTurismo"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""modern"", ""elegant""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""swept"", ""angled""],    ""grille"": [""chromed"", ""prominent""],    ""hood"": [""sculpted"", ""streamlined""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""upward-facing""],    ""bumper"": [""bulky"", ""sporty""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""lip""],    ""exhaust"": [""twin-turbocharged""]  }}```"
MASERATI Quattroporte,"In August 2020, Maserati presented its new Trofeo (Trophy) lineup for the Ghibli, the Quattroporte, and the Levante. All three of them shared the same Ferrari twin-turbo V8 engine. Maserati was in constant evolution in 2020, despite the hard times caused by the world pandemic situation. It launched new models, such as the MC20 supercar, and a more powerful version for its four-door models. The Quattroporte was their flagship, the car that was built for Italian CEOs. The Trofeo version was the fastest version of it. From the outside, the Trofeo looked similar to the regular Quattroporte, but some details made a difference. At the front, the car featured a different bumper and apron design, with a wider center grille and modified side-scoops to cool the brakes. From the side, the front fenders featured three vents with red trims and the Trofeo badge. On the C-pillars, under the brand's badge, a red stripe was installed. Inside, the Trofeo was fitted with the best amenities available in the Maserati storage. The instrument cluster featured a TFT color display between the speedometer and the tachometer. The infotainment system was fitted with a big touch-screen on the center stack. To complete the sporty character of the car, carbon-fiber trims were installed on the dashboard and the center console. But the real update was on the technological side. A 3.8-liter V8 engine was placed under the hood and paired to an 8-speed automatic transmission. Power went to the rear wheels only, via a standard limited-slip differential.

MASERATI Grecale,"Maserati joined the EV revolution and introduced an all-electric version of the Grecale SUV, named Folgore (lightning in Italian), in late 2022 as a 2023 model year. Maserati introduced its first crossover, the Levante, in 2016, and the carmakers' sales jumped over 50,000 units the following year for the first time in the brand's history. Then, unfortunately, sales plummeted during the world pandemic but started to recover after that. Thus, the company's management understood that despite all the critics, it had to build an SUV. And then, in 2022, it added a second model: the Grecale. The new model was shorter and based on the same Grigio platform as the Alfa Romeo Stelvio and the Jeep Grand Cherokee. The Grecale looked more like a scaled-down Levante from the outside. It was instantly recognizable Maserati thanks to its lines on the hood and the brand-specific triangular headlights. Unlike its siblings, it featured a fake grille since its electric motors didn't need that much cooling area. In addition, on the sides, the Folgere version got the same three vents, although these were closed and hinted at the three-motor setup. Maserati built an opulent cabin with space for five people and leather furnishings. The bucket seats in the front have bolstered sections to keep the occupants securely in place. In addition, the automobile manufacturer designed an oddly curved center stack for the dashboard to fit the large 12.3"" touchscreen for the infotainment system. The Grecale has an additional 12.3"" display for the instrument cluster and an 8.8"" touchscreen for comfort features. Last but not least, the center stack included a digital clock. In the Folgore version, the Grecale received a three-motor setup, one at the front and two at the rear, fed by a 105 kW battery pack.",MASERATI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Grecale"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""shorter"",  ""overall-design"": [""scaled-down"", ""recognizable"", ""opulent"", ""oddly curved""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""fake""],    ""hood"": [""lines""],    ""headlights"": [""triangular"", ""brand-specific""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""opulent"", ""leather""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MASERATI MC20,"It took Maserati a year and a half to launch the open-top version of the MC20 model, but the revolutionary features that were installed on the car were worth it. Maserati was the less-glamorous brand of the Ferrari and competed mainly against McLaren, and, unlike the prancing-horse badged car manufacturer, it offered a more luxurious environment. With the Cielo, the Italian carmaker provided a new experience, enhanced by the open top and hi-tech amenities. The Italian brand unveiled the MC20 Cielo (sky) in the late spring of 2022, and even though it sported the same front fascia as the coupe version, it looked different from the A-pillars behind. Thus, a retractable glass roof that measured 5,268 sq-cm (5.7 sq-ft) was fitted with the PDLC (Polymer-Dispersed Liquid Crystal) technology that allowed it to be transformed from transparent to opaque at the touch of a button. Moreover, it could have been totally retracted in 12 seconds while the vehicle was on the move. But that came with the cost of an added weight of 65 kg (143.3 lbs). To create a better experience for the driver and the side passenger, the carmaker installed butterfly-style doors opened upward and forward. Thus, it could offer a wider opening for easier ingress and egress. The ice-color Alcantara wrapped interior completed the luxurious image, yet sporty thanks to the design of the sports seats. Moreover, on the seats' headrests, the carmaker offered as an option hand-stitched trident embroideries. Also, the car featured an adjustable steering wheel, which was not provided on the 2020 MC20 Coupe. Under the hood, Maserati installed the same twin-turbo V6 powerplant as its sibling. The Nettuno engine, as the carmaker named it, offered a peak power of 621 hp (630 PS). It was mated to a six-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox.",MASERATI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""MC20 Cielo"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""hi-tech"", ""sporty"", ""revolutionary"", ""enhanced""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""retractable"", ""glass""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""butterfly-style"", ""wide opening""],    ""roof"": [""retractable"", ""transparent"", ""opaque"", ""hi-tech"", ""ice-color""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MASERATI Grecale Trofeo,"Maserati is not the kind of brand that build grocery getters. And even when it made an SUV, it gave it a hot version, which was the Grecale Trofeo. With a similar design to the regular Grecale, the Trofeo sported a few design elements that were unique to it. For instance, the ""Trofeo"" badges on the front fenders, above the traditional three squared shapes that denoted a V6 engine under the hood. Also, it sported a different, more aggressive front fascia with a lower lip that linked the air scoops installed on the sides of the bumper. In addition, the black grille with eight vertical slats and the trident badge in the middle created a different look for the car's front fascia. At the back, the Trofeo was 34 mm (1.34"") wider than the standard Grecale GT version. To top it all off, the car sported four exhausts at the back, blended into the black lower apron. The 21"" light-alloy wheels were standard for the Trofeo. Inside, it looked similar to the rest of the range. Like most of the famous Maserattis in the past, it featured leather upholstery with contrast stitching and exclusive materials. Its four displays were a statement for the modern design, with a 12.3"" monitor on the center stack above an 8"" touch-screen for the comfort controls, another 12.3"" TFT inside the instrument cluster, and, finally, a small clock in the middle of the dashboard. Under the hood, Maserati installed the three-liter, twin-turbo V6 powerplant that sent power in all corners via an eight-speed automatic transmission. With 530 horses on tap, it was no wonder that it could compete with many supercars in terms of performance.",MASERATI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Grecale Trofeo"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""wider than standard"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""sporty"", ""modern"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black"", ""eight vertical slats""],    ""hood"": [""squared shapes""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""air scoops"", ""lower lip""],    ""wheel"": [""21\"" light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [""leather upholstery"", ""contrast stitching""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""four exhausts"", ""blended into black lower apron""]  }}```"
MAZDA 2 / Demio,"Mazda unveiled the fourth generation of its small-sized vehicle, the 2, in 2023, and the brand’s aficionados were in shock since the car was, actually, a re-badged Toyota Yaris. Toyota and Mazda joined forces, and it wasn’t for the first time. While the third generation of the Mazda2 was sold in several countries, including Canada, as a re-badged Toyota Yaris and Yaris sedan, on the fourth generation, they swapped places. As a result, the fourth generation of the Mazda2 became a hybrid and was a brand-engineered product for the Yaris. This happened since Mazda needed a hybrid vehicle, and it didn’t have enough time or money to develop one from the ground up. On the other hand, Toyota couldn’t say no to its partner. In 2015, the two Japanese automakers inked a deal, and eight years later, the final product entered the market after the third generation of the 2 was out and sent into retirement after a long and fruitful career that spawned across nine years. Thanks to its size, the fourth Mazda2 fit into the B-segment vehicles class, which was very active and contested in Europe. To attract customers, the Mazda2 featured a sporty-looking front fascia with swept-back headlights and a grille that mostly resembled the one installed on its bigger siblings, the 6 and the CX5, which was flanked by a pair of scoops where the automaker installed the fog lamps. Furthermore, Mazda tried to make the car share at least some parts of this brand’s DNA instead of Toyota’s. As a result, customers could get it with a piano-black grille, door mirrors, roof, and B-pillars. Just like its twin sibling, the Yaris, the 2 was available as a five-door hatchback only. At the back, Mazda installed its badge on the tailgate and a trapezoidal-shaped lower apron integrated into the bumper. The interior was also available with a wide choice of options. Customers could order the vehicle at a lower budget with a 9” display for the infotainment with an option for a 10.5” touchscreen placed atop the center stack. Fronting the driver was a digital instrument cluster with two dials for the speedometer and tachometer that flanked a TFT display that showed information from the car’s onboard computer. Moreover, Mazda provided the 2 with a 10-inch head-up display as an option. Despite the car’s urban destination, the automaker didn’t want its customers to feel like they were in a mundane vehicle and offered a set of bolstered front seats, which looked very sporty. In the back, the split-folding bench was wide enough for two adult-sized passengers, although legroom was not that big. Mazda2 Hybrid was powered by Toyota’s 1.5-liter inline-three powerplant that ran in Atkinson cycle and a 59 kW electric motor. The total output of this system was 116 PS (114 HP), which were sent to the front wheels only via an e-CVT. Mazda2’s sporty look was confirmed by the stiff suspension and rigid bodywork, although it wasn’t a sports car; just a sporty five-door B-segment hatchback.",MAZDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mazda2"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""small-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""swept-back"", ""piano-black"", ""trapezoidal-shaped"", ""urban""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""swept-back"", ""piano-black""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [""trapezoidal-shaped""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""five-door""],    ""roof"": [""piano-black""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MAZDA 3 / Axela Sedan,"The fourth generation of Mazda 3 was introduced in 2018 and it followed the Kodo design language, showcased by the RX-Vision concept in the 2015 Tokyo Motor Show. The compact-segment was one of the most important in more markets around the world. From mass-market brands to premium brands, every car-maker had at least one member there. It was the market were a hatchback, a sedan, a station-wagon, a coupe or a convertible could find a place and a buyer. Mazda chose to launch only a 5-door hatchback and a sedan for the Mazda 3 in that segment. The Kodo design language was like a flowing metal in motion. And the 3 was just like that. The swept headlights, the flowing lines, and the short deck confirmed those principles. The sculptured door panels were flowing, following the air-stream. Inside, the 3 featured a double level design and the 8.8” infotainment screen rising up in the middle. The center stack hosted only the climate control buttons. On the center console, the designer installed the commander control, a rotary knob. The 3 featured a choice of engines ranged between a 1.8-liter diesel and 2.5-liter gasoline. All versions were assisted by the Mazda's new M Hybrid system, which increased fuel-efficiency and driving experience. The standard transmission for the entire range was a 6-speed manual, while a 6-speed auto was on the options list. The platform offered a front independent suspension and trailing arm in the rear. An all-wheel-drive version was available as well, but still without an independent suspension in the back.",MAZDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mazda 3"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""flowing metal in motion"", ""swept headlights"", ""flowing lines"", ""sculptured door panels"", ""double level design""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""swept""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MAZDA 6 / Atenza Sedan,"Mazda refreshed the third generation of the 6/Atenza range twice after the initial car launch in 2012 at the Moscow International Automobile Salon. It was the first generation of the Mazda 6 developed without Ford looking over its shoulders, and the Japanese designer Akira Tamatani went wild with it. The Kodo-soul style showed a vehicle that was better fitted in the large sedans than in the mid-size segment. Mazda didn't care about that: all it cared was to have a breathtaking looking flagship sedan, and it had it. The first facelift came in 2014 and showed small differences in the door mirror's turn signals and a few tiny details. In 2018, Mazda designers drastically improved the already beautiful sport sedan with LED headlights and a wider grille that made the car looks lower to the ground. The carmaker included a new set of 17- and 19"" light-alloy wheels in the options list. Inside, Mazda carried over only the steering wheel and a few trim parts from the second-facelift. The climate-control unit looked very similar to the one found in a BMW 3-Series, and it was installed lower on the center stack, just above the center console. The carmaker noticed that it was no longer that relevant; hence it offered an automatic function. An MX5-inspired infotainment display found its place on top of the dashboard. The driver could control it via a rotary knob placed on the center console. For excellent sound quality, Mazda installed a Bose sound system. Under the hood, the Japanese carmaker installed a choice of two gasoline and one diesel engine, offered in a wide power range between 145 hp and 227 hp.",MAZDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mazda 6/Atenza"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""large sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""breathtaking"", ""beautiful"", ""sporty"", ""wide grille"", ""LED headlights""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wider""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""17- and 19-inch light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MAZDA CX-3,"Already in its third year, the Mazda CX-3 proved to be a huge success in the small SUV market. For 2018, the CX-3 got an improved exterior design, as well as a better suspension that enhanced the driving experience. Safety was also increased by adding the automatic emergency braking system. For someone looking for a fun to drive, easy to manoeuvre even in the city, the CX-3 was among the top choices. One of the shortcomings that came with the CX-3 was the limited legroom and headroom for the rear passengers, thus, larger families would not have been that delighted by it. Available in three trim levels, the Sport, Touring and the Grand Touring, the CX-3 came with multiple features to satisfy most customers. The sport trim had a great starting price and was greatly equipped, with 16-inch alloy wheels, air-conditioning, cruise control, Bluetooth, a 7-inch touchscreen display, USB, a 6-speaker audio system, a height-adjustable driver seats and a 60/40-split folding rear seat. Moving to the upper Touring trim level, the CX-3 came equipped with bigger 18-inch alloys, heated mirrors, automatic wipers and automatic headlights. The interior was also upgraded with nicer cloth upholstery and even faux leather for the seats. Heated from seats were also included, along with a blind-spot monitoring system and rear cross-traffic alert. The top of the line, the Grand Touring, came with a sunroof, LED lightning for headlights, foglight and foglight,  leather upholstery, a head-up display, shift paddles mounted on the steering wheel and a better 7-speaker premium Bose audio system.",MAZDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mazda CX-3"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""small SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""improved"", ""fun"", ""manoeuvrable"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""stylish""],    ""hood"": [""sleek""],    ""headlights"": [""automatic"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""16-inch alloy"", ""18-inch alloy""],    ""doors"": [""equipped""],    ""roof"": [""sunroof""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MAZDA 3 / Axela Hatchback,"Mazda introduced the fourth generation of the 3/Axela at the 2018 Los Angeles Auto Show and was offered as a 2019 model-year worldwide. This nameplate was one of the most important in Mazda's inventory since it was the one that could provide big numbers. But while other automakers made their compact-sized vehicles in more shapes, such as coupes, convertibles, and wagons, the Japanese automaker focused on the sedan and five-door hatchback form. Following the Kodo design language introduced in 2010 and already present on the CX-9 or the 6, the 3 hatchback featured similar flowing lines over its bodywork. The Japanese designer Yasutake Tsuchida penned the vehicle with swept-back headlights and a broad pentagonal grille at the front. In addition, the aggressive front fascia also featured a small lip spoiler placed at the bottom of the lower bumper. Unlike its sedan sibling, the 3 had an arched rear end with very wide C-pillars and a Kammback styling for the tailgate. Inside, the 3 featured a double level design and the 8.8"" infotainment screen rising up in the middle. The designer installed the controller for it on the center console, a rotary knob. In addition, the automaker provided large round dials mounted on the dashboard, in the middle, for the HVAC system. The 3 featured engines, either gasoline or diesel, ranged between a 1.8-liter and 2.5-liter displacement. All versions were assisted by Mazda's new M Hybrid system, which increased fuel efficiency and driving experience. The standard transmission for the entire range was a 6-speed manual, while a 6-speed auto was on the options list. The platform offered a front independent suspension and trailing arm in the rear.

MAZDA CX-5,"The Japanese manufacturer advertised the CX-5 as not being just a regular compact SUV. And for sure, that does sound like marketing, however, we cannot deny that the CX-5 was one of the best looking compact crossover on the market. For 2016, the looks didn’t change very much, and that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing, as the Mazda’s design was popular and liked all over the world. The front changes included dynamic steering LED headlamps and LED foglamps, while the back was fitted with angry-looking full LED taillamps. From the side profile, the CX-5 was reminiscent to the BMW’s crossovers. While looking at the rear windows line, it gave the impression that the passengers in the back would have limited headroom. However, the headroom available in the back was fairly generous, as well as the legroom, and that made the CX-5 a good choice for longer trips with more than 2 people. A small downside, due to the sloping rear glass, the CX-5 offered less cargo room. Under the hood, the CX-5 came with a choice of two engines: a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder that developed 155 hp. This engine was mated to a 6-speed manual transmission, with no automatic gearbox as an option. The more powerful 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine cranked out 184 hp and was fitted with an automatic transmission. Economy wise, the 2.0-liter engine offered a great fuel consumption.",MAZDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""CX-5"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""dynamic"", ""popular"", ""reminiscent"", ""generous"", ""sloping""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""dynamic""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""dynamic""],    ""bumper"": [""angry-looking""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloping""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MAZDA CX-9,"Mazda understood that despite offering a good MPV on the market, the Premacy, the SUVs, and the cross-overs are the future. And it combined these two types of vehicles. Developed on the new Skyactive platform, the 2016 CX-9 was the second generation of the big SUV built by Mazda, mostly for the U.S. market. It combined the look of a sporty SUV, such as the CX5, with a minivan's utility, such as the Premacy. That should've made everyone happy. Designing an SUV with three rows of seats in a package that should look like a regular SUV was never easy, but the Japanese designers did it. The 5 meters (199 in) vehicle disguised the three seats in a usual, BMW X5-like form with flowing lines and a massive front grille that attracted attention more than the third row of side windows and the thick D-pillar. The CX-9 headlights resembled those installed on the Mazda 6 sedan, or those on the CX5 with their slim, curved shape barely seen between the hood and the very tall bumper. Inside, the dashboard resembled the one in the MX5 or the 3, with an infotainment screen placed on top of the panel and a three-dial instrument cluster. The tall center console placed between the front seats inspired the driver to feel like it was a sports car, despite the high seating position. To access the middle and the last row of seats the rear doors were longer than those found on the CX5 model. Under the hood, the CX-9 featured only one engine option, a turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-four unit paired to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Mazda offered the 7-seat SUV either with a front- or all-wheel-drive system.",MAZDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""CX-9"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""5 meters"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""utility"", ""flowing lines"", ""massive front grille"", ""curved shape""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""massive""],    ""hood"": [""flowing""],    ""headlights"": [""slim"", ""curved""],    ""bumper"": [""tall""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""longer""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MAZDA 6 / Atenza Wagon,"The third generation of Mazda 6 was launched in 2012 both as a sedan and station wagon. It stunned the world with its beauty and, in 2016, a mid-life cycle refresh was up on the market. It is very hard to enhance visually a vehicle that was acclaimed for its look, and the design seemed to look brand new even after 4 years. Mazda had this situation when it had to rejuvenate its top model, the large model 6. But it had to and the most important elements that it changed were under the hood. On the outside, there were few subtle modifications, such as the turn signals from the exterior rearview mirrors. On the facelifted version thee were horizontal instead of vertical. The grille had a 3D pattern, like a mesh with diamonds on it. Big enhancements were to be found inside the cabin, where the dashboard was more driver-oriented. A head-up display was added to the features, a new steering wheel and better materials were used. Also, a 360 degrees camera system was included in the options list. A new system was installed in the car, to enhance cornering speed. When cornering, a slight brake is applied on the inside wheels and on the exit the torque sent to the wheels is amplified. Thus, the car will handle better on bends. It is something that good drivers do: slight brake before the turn and throttle after the apex. But Mazda's technology is better since it brakes only the inside wheels. Most of the engines and transmissions are carried over from the non-facelift model.",MAZDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mazda 6"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""stunning"", ""subtle"", ""driver-oriented"", ""enhanced"", ""beautiful""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""3D"", ""diamond-pattern""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MAZDA MX-5 / Miata,"Mazda MX5/Miata was already the best selling roadster ever and, in 2016, it introduced a new body version named RF – Retractable Fastback. The Japanese carmaker used a British recipe: a small engine in the front, the power went to the rear wheels, and the vehicle was as light as possible. While the Miata's first-generation tipped the scale lower than one ton, the 2016 version was already heavier due to the introduction of comfort and safety features. At the same time, it kept the four-pot engines under the hood, but with a higher power. Mazda imagined a new look for its light, nimble roadster. It added a B-pillar and a retractable roof on top of it. When the driver uncovered the car, it wasn't a true roadster anymore. It was more of a targa. It was as a roadster as a Honda Civic DelSol two decades before it. Unlike the Honda, which featured fixed pillars and a power-operated top, Mazda used a different way to remove the top of the vehicle. But the idea was the same, and, after all, it wasn't a true roadster anymore. The car's interior was the same as the one from the regular rag-top version with high-bolstered Recaro seats. The MX5/Miata offered an instrument cluster with three round dials and a center-mounted tachometer. It created a great view and a race-inspired image for the driver. Due to its high center console, Mazda separated the driver from its front passenger. Mazda installed its revolutionary 2.0-liter Skyactive engine that offered up to 167 hp, depending on the market under the hood. It was paired to a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed auto. The MX5/Miata RF was a driver-focused vehicle, and the carmaker installed a standard LSD for the drive axle.",MAZDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mazda MX5/Miata"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""light"", ""nimble"", ""targa"", ""driver-focused"", ""race-inspired""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""retractable""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""high-bolstered""],    ""roof"": [""retractable""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MAZDA 5 / Premacy,"Mazda unveiled the third generation of the Premacy/5 lineup at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show, and it was designed as an ultimate family MPV. While the customers were already looking for crossover-SUV vehicles, a few carmakers tried to keep the MPV spirit alive. Mazda was one of them, and it built the third generation of the 5/Premacy on the same platform as the compact 3 model. From the design point of view, there was already a clear departure from Ford's management. Mazda's front fascia was changed into a smiling face with a grille that looked like an open laughing mouth. The headlights resembled those installed on the Mazda 3 series. On the sides, a wave-like sculptured door panels and made a clear impression of movement. Despite the big rear area, the tailgate didn't look like it was stolen from a shed and bolted on the car. Its sweeping, V-shaped lower line and the big taillights formed a well-balanced proportion between metal and glass areas. But the essential part of the car was the interior, where the carmaker installed seven seats on three rows. The last row was in the trunk and, as expected, could fold flat into the trunk area. The second row was tilting and sliding to allow easier access in the back. Also, the middle seat could have been folded and used as an armrest or a storage compartment. At the front, Mazda tried to offer a good driving position for the Premacy, regardless of the driver's height. The Japanese carmaker installed a wide engine choice under the 5/Premacy's hood. Depending on the market, Mazda offered gasoline or turbo-diesel versions, paired to manual or automatic transmissions.",MAZDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Premacy/5"",  ""year"": ""2010"",  ""size"": ""compact MPV"",  ""overall-design"": [""family-friendly"", ""dynamic"", ""well-proportioned""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""smiling"", ""open"", ""distinctive""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""resembling Mazda 3 series""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""wave-like sculptured""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MAZDA Flair,"The kei-cars never caught in Europe and they were far too small for the U.S. market. But in Asian countries, it is a trend that keeps going strong. Suzuki is one of the biggest car-manufacturer of small vehicles and its expertise was used for badge engineering. It was the same case with the Opel Agila/Suzuki Wagon R in Europe for the second generation of the Japanese car and, on the fifth generation for the same lineup, it was also built for Mazda as the Mazda Flair. The small, tall, boxy vehicles are known in Japan as kei cars and it is a part of the Japanese car culture. The Flair had a short front end and a cube-like cabin with a vertical end. Its big headlights started from the front bumper and were stretched almost up to the A-pillars. In the rear, the taillights were mounted on the pillars since it was cheaper than to install a part of them on the tailgate too. When compared to a Suzuki Wagon R, the only different part was the grille front bumper, which included the grille with the Mazda logo on it. Mazda Flair was offered in two trim levels, but both had a CVT fitted as standard. The upper trim, named Flair XT, had a nice infotainment system installed on top of the center console. Only one engine was offered, with a mild-hybrid system.",MAZDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mazda Flair"",  ""year"": ""fifth generation"",  ""size"": ""small, tall, boxy"",  ""overall-design"": [""small"", ""tall"", ""boxy"", ""cube-like"", ""vertical""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""short front end""],    ""grille"": [""grille with Mazda logo""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""big"", ""stretched""],    ""bumper"": [""front bumper""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""cube-like cabin""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MAZDA CX-50,"Mazda introduced a new model in its lineup at the 2021 LA Auto Show. It wasn't a shrunk version of the larger CX-5 or an extended version of another model from its stable. With the CX-50, the Japanese carmaker tried to get more attention and more market share, especially in the mid-size crossover segment. It was the first vehicle built by Mazda on the MTM (Mazda Toyota Manufacturing) plant from Huntsville, Alabama. The car's design was more aggressive than on the CX-5, and its styling was closer to its smaller sibling, the CX-30. Its front fascia looked more rugged like it was ready to tackle some serious off-road trails, not just regular roads and parking lots. In addition, the carmaker added black, unpainted plastic moldings around the wheel arches. At the back, the taillights' design resembled the one from the 3 Hatchback version, with clear U-shaped lines for the parking lights. On the lower side of the bumper, Mazda installed an aluminum-looking plastic shield flanked by two exhausts. Inside, Mazda made a surprising move by stepping up the game with an up-scaled design. Its clean, minimalist lines and materials offered a premium feel. Despite the general trend of replacing analog dials with full TFT displays, Mazda kept a mix of both, with a screen that looked like floating in the middle of the speedometer. The driver, or the side passenger, could have accessed the infotainment unit via a center-console mounted rotary knob. Since the car was slightly smaller than the CX-5, it featured five-seat options exclusively, with a split-folding bench in the rear.",MAZDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""CX-50"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""mid-size crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""rugged"", ""premium"", ""clean"", ""minimalist""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""rugged""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""aluminum-looking"", ""plastic shield""],    ""wheel"": [""black plastic moldings""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual"", ""aluminum-looking""],  }}```"
MAZDA Biante,"Mazda introduced the Biante for the Japanese market in 2008 and built it on top of the same platform used by the Mazda5 MPV. Developed just before the world economic crisis, the Biante aimed at customers looking for a minivan that could provide a sporty look and a spacious interior. It didn't even try to offer the car in more markets and planned just a 3,000 sales target for the MPV. The car was developed during the Zoom-Zoom design language of the Japanese carmaker. It followed the same ideas as the Miata, the 3, and the 6. Thus, at the front, the car featured high-mounted headlights swept back toward the thick A-pillars. The front fascia featured a shield-like grille crossed by a slat that supported the license plate. The foglamps were placed in the tall and slim side clusters that flanked the grille. Biante's high-roof profile featured blacked-out pillars that created the illusion of a long window from front to back. Thanks to the standard sliding rear doors, the passengers could easily get in and out of the vehicle. Inside, the eight-seat minivan featured high-mounted bucket seats at the front and two benches for three passengers in the back. Mazda stepped up the game in the otherwise dull MPV segment by creating a sliding middle row. That solution allowed the passengers to get more legroom when there was no one seated in the last row. Above the dash panel, Mazda designers installed a center-mounted instrument cluster covered by a long and curved visor. Atop the center stack, the carmaker added the infotainment screen just above the gear selector and the HVAC buttons. Mazda offered the Biante exclusively with automatic transmissions. The AWD versions received a four-speed auto, while the FWD ones were fitted with five-speed automatic transmissions with manual override.",MAZDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Biante"",  ""year"": ""2008"",  ""size"": ""minivan"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""spacious"", ""high-roof profile"", ""sliding rear doors"", ""eight-seat""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""tall""],    ""grille"": [""shield-like"", ""crossed by a slat""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""high-mounted"", ""swept back""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sliding""],    ""roof"": [""high-roof"", ""blacked-out pillars""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MAZDA CX-60,"Mazda opened a new chapter in its automotive technology achievements when it introduced the CX-60 on the market in 2022 as its first PHEV ever. With the SUV-mania spreading around the world and the addition of the electric-car frenzy, Mazda made a wise choice by creating an electrified SUV. While it wasn't completely electric, it was much more attractive for those who were too affected by the anxiety range. Obviously, the car's look clearly followed the same design language as its sibling, the CX-5. Its sharp-looking headlights and the big drop for the massive grille into the apron were part of the carmaker's brand image. A pair of chromed trims adorned the front fenders and showed the PHEV lettering. At the back, below the bumper, Mazda installed a quad exhaust system with rectangular tips. For the interior, Mazda adopted an evolved Kodo design trend. The massive, longitudinal center console emphasized the longitudinally mounted engine at the front. It was wide enough for both occupants and allowed for a driver-side mounted gear selector, while the passenger had access to a small compartment with a lid. Atop the center console that hosted the climate control unit, Mazda placed a 12.3"" display for the HMI (Human Interface Machine) infotainment system. Under the hood, Mazda offered a choice of three engines. The PHEV version featured a 2.5-liter inline-four aided by a 100 kW electric motor for a total of 322 hp (327 PS) and 369 lb-ft (500 Nm) of torque. It was mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission that sent the power in all corners. Apart from this range-topper version, the carmaker also provided a 3.0-liter inline-six and a 3.3-liter oil-burner, which were available with either an AWD or an RWD system.",MAZDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""CX-60"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""sharp-looking"", ""attractive"", ""evolved"", ""massive"", ""wide""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""sharp-looking""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""sharp-looking"", ""big""],    ""bumper"": [""quad"", ""rectangular""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""quad"", ""rectangular""]  }}```"
MAZDA CX-90,"Mazda ditched the downsize trend and introduced the CX-90 in the spring of 2023 for the 2024 model-year, and installed a completely new range of drivetrains for its biggest SUV. The Japanese brand's engineers burned the midnight oil to develop a new platform and a new range of engines for the CX-90. In addition, the new SUV was built to compete with premium vehicles, not with the likes of Honda or Hyundai. The result was a large, three-row family vehicle. With an unmistakable Mazda design, the CX-90 featured a front fascia that was adorned with a set of daytime running lights that connected the headlights with the main grille. In addition, the LED DRLs from inside the headlamps were C-shaped to provide a unique look for the massive vehicle. On the front fenders, the carmaker added a set of fake vents that were adorned with either “Inline six” or “PHEV” lettering, depending on the engine version. Also, the stretched platform and the long cabin created an imposing look for the CX-90. Inside, the carmaker threw everything it got in terms of comfort and luxury items. The dashboard looked special with the fabric that covered it. At the front, the two bucket seats were separated by a wide center console that housed the gear selector and a pair of cup holders. In addition, Mazda placed the controls for the infotainment unit. Besides the digital instrument panel and the LCD that sat atop the center stack, the automaker also offered a large head-up display. Even if most automakers started to provide vehicles with small, inline-four engines, Mazda introduced the CX-90 with either a 3.3-liter inline-six powerplant, or a 2.5-liter inine four  that was helped by an electric motor.",MAZDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""CX-90"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""imposing"", ""premium"", ""unique"", ""comfortable"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""main"", ""adorned""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""C-shaped"", ""connected""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MAZDA CX-8,"Since more and more customers were looking for 7-seat vehicles in the SUV segment, but not very large, Mazda introduced the CX8 model, which was placed between the CX5 and the larger X9. As most of the car-makers, Mazda chose to build specific products for specific markets. Due to the high demand for 7-seat vehicles in the SUV segment in South-east Asia, China, and Oceania, the Japanese car-maker introduced the CX8 model, especially for them. The CX8 featured the same front design of a CX5, but with a different grille design. The headlights, daytime running lights, and foglights were LED-equipped. It featured the same wheelbase as the CX9, but slightly shorter in the overall length. Inside, the CX8 was fitted as standard with 6 or 7 seats, depending on the engine and trim level. For those fitted with 6, the middle row featured captain seats, either with a passage between them for the rear seats or with a center console. The dashboard featured a minimalist design, with rounded flat surfaces. The 7” infotainment system featured Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity and the instrument cluster featured three round dials that resembled the former generation of the CX5. The CX8 was fitted as standard with a 6-speed automatic transmission for both engines available.

MAZDA MX-30,"After successfully introducing the MX-30 EV crossover on the market in 2019, Mazda made another ambitious step and launched a version fitted with a range extender in 2022. The Japanese automaker was renowned for its rotary engines installed in the RX-7/RX-8 series. Unfortunately, this type of powerplant failed to meet the pollution norms and had to be ditched in 2012. But Mazda didn't want to sack it for good and found a new way of using it by installing one in the MX-30 e-Skyactive R-EV. Such a long name for a version... Mazda didn't bother to create a new design for its crossover, and it looked similar to the regular MX-30 EV. It still sported those rear-hinged rear doors, like in the former RX-8, and without a B-pillar. The only significant difference was the new badges, which said ""e-Skyactive R-EV."" Inside you are greeted with a cabin made mostly from fibrous materials. For example, the door trim is covered with fibers made from recycled plastic bottles, while parts of the center console trim are covered in a texture called Heritage Cork, which is a material harvested from the bark of trees without felling. For the first time in a Mazda production car, a 7-inch touch panel heater control has been fitted inside to offer better control. Under the hood, the car featured a drivetrain consisting of an 830 cc Wankel rotary engine that was used exclusively to charge the batteries. A 17.8 kW battery pack and a 50-liter (13.2-gal U.S.) tank fueled the system and helped the vehicle achieve a range of 373 miles (600 km). Unlike the MX-30 EV, the R-EV version was propelled by a 170 PS motor, thus providing slightly better performance than the 143 hp provided by its electric-only cousin.",MAZDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""MX-30"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""similar to regular MX-30 EV"", ""rear-hinged rear doors"", ""no B-pillar""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""rear-hinged"", ""no B-pillar""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MAZDA CX-30,"The Mazda CX-30 was introduced in 2019 at the Geneva Motor Show and it directly competes with the Jeep Compass and the Nissan Rogue Sport. To deliver even greater and more effortless driving pleasure, Mazda has introduced Skyactiv-Vehicle Architecture to the new Mazda CX-30, to keep its drivers more engaged in the driving experience. The gasoline engines of Mazda CX-30 are equipped with Mazda's new M-Hybrid system, featuring electric drive technology. This mild-hybrid system features an efficient electric motor that assists the engine with a 24V 600kJ lithium-ion battery. To enhance fuel economy and reduce friction, Mazda's engineering team has adopted a rubber damper inside the power take-off unit and developed a new control system, that delivers a stable commute in any situation, reducing fuel consumption nearly as much as on a front-wheel-drive vehicle. Mazda continues its efforts to improve safety performance by equipping the CX-30 with numerous safety technologies, thus emphasizing Mazda's philosophy that guides all the company's research and consequently helping to prevent numerous accidents. Some of the numerous features are i-Activsense active safety, which includes a driver monitoring system that observes the driver's condition and traffic support (CTS), which lowers the driver's fatigue by assisting with the accelerator pedal.",MAZDA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mazda CX-30"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MCLAREN 765LT,"The British supercar builder McLaren had built a new track-focused, still road-legal supercar, the 765LT. Does this resemble the 90s’ F1 GTR? Sure does. Where from the nameplate of 765LT? First of all, the 4.0-liter V8 engine developed 765 hp. Second of all? It was the exact number of units produced. Quite unique! The 765LT was more likely an upgraded version of the previous McLaren 720S. And by upgrading, i mean weight reduction, thus power increase. The sports car could rocket to 100 kmph in only 2.8 seconds and reached a top speed of 330 km/h. The supercar weighed only 1339 kg and measured 4.6 meters long and 2.2 meters wide. How did McLaren manage to create such a lightweight vehicle? Wherever possible, they used lightweight materials – the chassis contained components made of carbon-fiber, as well as the front and the rear bumper, the front floor, etc. . Compared to its predecessor, the 2020 model came with a new aero package that offered around 25% more downforce. The visual differences were few, such as new 10-spoke alloys, that were lighter by 22 kg, a new front bumper and a redesgined, more aggresive rear diffuser. The interior was fitted with an Alcantara wrapped steering wheel and dashboard. Customers could choose between 17 exterios colors, however, completely bespoke paint schemes were available.",MCLAREN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""765LT"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""4.6 meters long, 2.2 meters wide"",  ""overall-design"": [""track-focused"", ""road-legal"", ""upgraded"", ""aggressive"", ""lightweight""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""carbon-fiber"", ""lightweight"", ""front"", ""rear""],    ""wheel"": [""10-spoke"", ""lighter""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""redesigned"", ""aggressive""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [],  }}```"
MCLAREN Senna,"As a tribute to one of the greatest racing drivers in the world, Ayrton Senna, McLaren launched a special edition in 2018. It was lighter, faster and more expensive than any other McLaren to that moment. The Senna was the next step in McLaren’s Ultimate Series range. It sat above the Super Series (720S) and Sport Series (540 and 570) models. It was not a replacement for the P1, but it was designed to set new standards in track performance. Only 500 units were made. The look of the vehicle was a form that followed function, but without compromising the look. It was aerodynamically efficient, with an aggressive look due to its large air-intakes on the front and the streamlined headlights. On top of the vehicle, there was another air-intake for the engine. Further air-extracting vents behind the wheels and more air-scoops were placed where they were needed. Inside, there was a combination of carbon-fiber and Alcantara that covered all the interior. Some aluminum elements around the air-vents and chromed buttons on the infotainment display completed the overall image of a radical sports car. The 1198 kg (2641,13 lbs) vehicle was the lightest McLaren since the iconic F1, which was 60 kg (132 lbs) lighter. The 4.0-liter engine was boosted by a pair of twin-scroll turbochargers offered 800 hp and it was mated to a standard seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic gearbox. For the suspension, was race-derived, to offer the best possible handling and to develop high cornering speeds.",MCLAREN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Senna"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""lightweight, compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""aerodynamic"", ""aggressive"", ""radical"", ""sporty"", ""efficient""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""streamlined""],    ""headlights"": [""large"", ""streamlined""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""air-extracting"", ""scooped""],    ""doors"": [""carbon-fiber"", ""Alcantara-covered""],    ""roof"": [""lightweight""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""exhaust"": [""twin-scroll""]  }}```"
MCLAREN 570S Spider,"Removing the roof from a supercar might alter its performances, but add more fun into the equation. But what if there would be, virtually, no performance loss? McLaren did that with the 570S Spider. When McLaren designed the 570S bodywork, it engineered it in parallel in both versions, as a coupe and a convertible, at the same time. Building the coupe with a carbon-fiber structure and with reinforcements around the cabin and not in the roof, meant that the designers could remove the roof and not alter the car's performances. From the outside, the 570S spider looks almost like the coupe version, when seen from the front or the side. The panels behind the cabin have the same design as those from the closed version. In the front, the shape of the headlights is the same as the McLaren logo. The same goes for the taillights and the turn-signals. The doors are the same for the coupe and the spider, with the same upward-opening system. The main difference between the two supercars is that the spider can be opened in 15 seconds at speeds up to 40 kph (25 mph). The cabin was the same as in the coupe, with the same bucket-seats and driver-focused dashboard. Behind them, the shelf was removed and there is the compartment for the two-piece aluminum roof. A glazed wind deflector could have been raised or lowered at the touch of a button, to decrease the wind-buffeting when the roof was retracted. Or it can be lowered for a more “cabriolet” experience. Under the hood, there was the same 3.8-liter twin-turbo engine from the 570S with the same power and torque. Since the convertible was just 46 kg (101.4 lbs) heavier than the coupe, the 0 to 100 kph (0-62 mph) time was the same.",MCLAREN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""McLaren 570S Spider"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""aerodynamic"", ""stylish"", ""convertible"", ""performance-oriented""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""glazed""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""carbon-fiber""],    ""headlights"": [""sleek"", ""McLaren-logo-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""upward-opening""],    ""roof"": [""aluminum"", ""retractable""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""twin-turbo""]  }}```"
MCLAREN Elva,"The year was 2020, and the world was in complete lockdown due to the pandemic situation. Still, McLaren considered that it was the appropriate time to launch an outrageous speedster called Elva. And it did it. McLaren engineers started to work on the project long before the tiny virus spread its terror around the Earth, sent almost everybody home, and taught us how to work remotely. The car’s name came from French Elle Va (Eng. she goes) and was also the name of a British race car manufacturer, Elva, which built Bruce McLaren’s vehicles in the ‘60s. So, the production version had to be outrageous. Initially, McLaren tried to sell 499 of these, but since it couldn’t find enough customers, it had to scale down its ambitions to just 149. Furthermore, deliveries had to be postponed until 2021, and McLaren even had to install a windshield on the vehicle to broaden its customer database. In some countries and states in the U.S., legislation didn’t allow vehicles without a fixed window in front of the driver. The car’s shape was fluid and boasted a shark-nose styling adorned by the C-shaped side intakes that housed the LED headlights. In the lower bumper area, McLaren installed a mouth-like air intake with two vertical struts that supported the lower splitter, while on the front’s clamshell was an exhaust vent with internal channels that diverted the airflow at a 130-degree angle via the Active Air Management System (AAMS) above the cockpit, which featured carbon fiber. From its profile, the muscular look of the front and rear fenders revealed a connection with the 1960s cars. McLaren’s designers took inspiration from the same cars when they made the double humps behind the cockpit, which concealed the safety arches. The deeply sculptured dihedral doors opened upwards to ease ingress and egress. At the back, the Elva sported LED horizontal taillights and two round exhausts that poked through the center of the rear fascia. Underneath it, the complicated diffuser was functional and amplified the ground effect that sucked the car onto the ground to increase grip during high-speed cornering. The cabin boasted a high level of luxury but with a distinct approach for the driver and the side passenger. As a result, the one behind the wheel could focus just on driving, with the digital dashboard fronting them and a floating-mounted touchscreen above the center console, tilted toward the driver. The side passenger could enjoy the unrestricted view to the front since there was no A-pillar or windshield. Both occupants sat in high-bolstered sports seats wrapped in Aniline leather that could hold them in place during high-speed cornering maneuvers. McLaren built the Elva based on the same platform as the 720S and played in the same league as the Ferrari Monza and the Aston Martin V12 Speedster. Still, unlike those, it was powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 that sent 815 PS (804 hp) to the rear wheels via a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox. It was the most powerful version of the M840TR engine made by McLaren, and the car boasted a 0-200 kph (0-124 MPH) time of just 6.7 seconds.",MCLAREN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Elva"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""outrageous"", ""fluid"", ""muscular"", ""luxurious"", ""distinct""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""broadened""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""shark-nose""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""C-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [""mouth-like"", ""lower splitter""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""dihedral"", ""upward-opening""],    ""roof"": [""double humps""],    ""diffusor"": [""functional"", ""complicated""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""round"", ""centered""]  }}```"
MCLAREN 600LT,"McLaren expanded its LT family with the high-performance McLaren 600 LT, a faster version of the entry level McLaren 570s. The “LT” nameplate actually meant “Long tail” and was inspired by the McLaren F1 Long Tail. The most performant McLaren’s car at the time, the McLaren 600LT was lighter by 96 kg and got 30 extra ponies under the hood compared to the 570s, having a total of 592 hp given by the powerful 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine. The power was sent to the rear wheels through a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. McLaren has paid tremendous attention to details when building the 600LT and even started with the key fob, which had an unusual shape and an innovative trunk opener button. Instead of looking to see which the button was dedicated to open the trunk, drivers just needed to put their finger on the front key surface and feel two little bumps. Design wise, the little bumps were actually the wheels of a drawn car. From the outside, the 600LT’s doors drew immediate attention, looking more like two levels of doors with the air intake between them. The scissor doors had hidden door “handles” under the top layer of the door. From the inside, the electric doors would open by the press of a push-up door handle. Just in case the car’s battery would had been drained, the 600LT was equipped with a manual door release system as well. Inside, the cabin was fitted with grippy carbon fiber bucket seats that were manually adjustable. No power seats were available, as the main focus was on weight saving. And also related to weight saving was the rather “unfinished” bare carbon fiber floor under the car’s floor mats. Storage spaces were limited, however, McLaren did some tricks to still offer room for a phone or a coffee. There was a cupholder placed underneath the dashboard, a storage net between the backrests and one at the passenger’s feet. Moving to the center console, the McLaren 600LT did not feature a classical gear lever, but buttons to select the gear. From the center console the driver could select the preferred driving mode, switching between N, S and T, Normal, Sport and Track. With Track driving mode selected, the cluster gauge’s design changed into a track-oriented one.",MCLAREN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""McLaren 600LT"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""lighter, smaller"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""aerodynamic"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""long"", ""sleek""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""lightweight""],    ""doors"": [""scissor"", ""hidden handles""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""powerful""]  }}```"
MCLAREN 540C,"Every carmaker has one lowest-priced vehicle, and McLaren had the 540C in 2015 as the entry-level supercar, even though it's hard to call a supercar an entry-level vehicle. McLaren tried to get more customers from other brands who created more affordable alternatives to the British manufacturer's 570S and introduced the lower-spec version of that supercar in the form of the 540C. Even if it sported a six-figure price tag, it was still more affordable. The 540 Coupe was built on top of a carbon-fiber MonoCell II chassis adapted for day-to-day driving usability. As a result, its look resembled its bigger brother, the 570S but lost some of the aerodynamic elements that made the S a fierce track competitor. Thus, the Coupe lost the blades under the front bumper, redesigned for a less-aggressive look. Still, the lower part featured wide air intakes needed to cool the brakes and the radiators placed upfront. Moreover, the side sills were less profiled and not so low to the ground, so the driver shouldn't be worried about speed bumps. Yet, the mid-engined supercar kept similar black side air-intakes for the engine, and there was no wing at the back. Yet, the rear bumper showcased a big diffuser that also hosted the two exhausts on the outer sides. Inside, the carmaker extensively used the leather on the seats, door cards, and lower door areas. In addition, a 7"" IRIS touchscreen infotainment found its place on the center stack. Moreover, it incorporated the HVAC control unit. As expected, the sports seats wore high-bolstered areas. Behind the cabin, the carmaker placed a twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter V8 engine that provided enough oomph to the rear wheels to rocket the car from naught to 62 mph (0-100 kph) in 3.5 seconds.",MCLAREN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""McLaren 540C"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""mid-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""sporty"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""less-aggressive""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""wide air intakes"", ""less-aggressive look"", ""big diffuser""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""leather-trimmed""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""big""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""twin""]  }}```"
MCLAREN 620R,"To be built in an extremely limited edition of just 350 units, the McLaren 620R is essentially the road-going version of the McLaren 570S GT4 race car, the most winningest McLaren in every championship it has competed in since it was launched in 2017. After receiving tons of customer requests for an homologated version of the GT4 model for the road, McLaren saw fit to built a special edition sports car that not only harks back to the old days of ""win on Sunday, sell on Monday"" but also offers a nimbleness not found in the regular 570S. The 620R is derived directly from the 570S GT4 race car, with whom it shares a rather high level of commonality. Both cars have the same Monocell II carbon fiber chassis, thanks to which the 620R has a dry weight of just 1,282 kg. Adjustable aerodynamic elements, racing suspension and the calibration of the powertrain are also quasi-identical between the two. The main difference relies in the powertrain's output, which makes the 620R the most power car in McLaren's Sports Series lineup to date. With no racing regulations to follow, the M838TE 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged V8 delivers 620 horsepower and 620 Nm (457 lb-ft) of torque, enough for the RWD model to accelerate from 0 to 100 kph (62 mph) in just 2.9 seconds and from 0 to 200 kph (124 mph) in a staggering 8.1 seconds.",MCLAREN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""McLaren 620R"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""nimble"", ""aerodynamic"", ""powerful"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sleek""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""carbon-fiber""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""racing""],    ""doors"": [""lightweight""],    ""roof"": [""low-profile""],    ""diffusor"": [""adjustable""],    ""spoiler"": [""high-performance""],    ""exhaust"": [""twin-turbocharged""]  }}```"
MCLAREN Artura,"After the race toward clean vehicles, the race for hybrid-powered supercars made the petrolheads think again if that wasn't a better choice, such as the McLaren Artura showed it in 2021. The supercars world was changing. Porsche and Ferrari showed that very clear with the 918 and the SF90, but McLaren was not far behind. It waited and tried to create a supercar that could be driven as an electric vehicle for shorter distances. Thus, the McLaren tried to be as close as possible to a daily driver supercar. Its aerodynamic shape served both for reducing drag resistance and fuel consumption. At the front, the car showed the already established McLaren design with angled headlights and side-scoops in the front bumper. On the sides, a set of deeper air intakes provided more air to cool and feed the mid-engine V-6. Inside, the Artura showed another revolutionary cockpit design centered around the driver. McLaren moved the driving mode selector on the instrument cluster. Instead of a conventional center stack, the British carmaker mounted a portrait-mode touch-screen tilted toward the driver. As in any other McLaren, the sport bucket-seats featured high-bolstered sides to provide better support during high cornering. The Artura was completely new from the ground up, developed on the new McLaren Carbon Lightweight Architecture (MCLA). Thanks to its compact electrical system that reduced the need for longer cables, the 2021 Artura tipped the scale up to 1395 kg (3075 lbs) dry weight, a key factor for the British supercar. The total hybrid components had just 130 kg (286 lbs), including the battery pack. As a plug-in hybrid vehicle, the Artura could drive up to 19 miles (30 km) in electric mode.",MCLAREN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""McLaren Artura"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""aerodynamic"", ""revolutionary"", ""sporty"", ""compact"", ""electric""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""angled""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""headlights"": [""angled""],    ""bumper"": [""front"", ""deep air intakes""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sporty""],    ""roof"": [""lightweight""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""hybrid""]  }}```"
MCLAREN 720S,"McLaren introduced an open-top version for the 720S in 2018, but It did it so that the car didn’t lose its overall performance. When McLaren’s engineering team developed the 720S bodywork, it had the vision of the roadster in mind. Thus, even if there were some reinforcements added, the car was just 49 kg (108 lbs) heavier than its fixed-roof sibling. The wide triangular-shaped headlights are splitter into two halves by the LED daytime running lights. The headlamps’ black background made the entire lamp looks part of the bodywork, like those installed on the 720S Coupe. Behind the cabin, the carmaker added a pair of safety arches concealed under two bulges, which resembled the “hunchbacks” from an F1 race car. When covered, the electrically operated roof came from behind and hid under the panel that sat above the engine compartment. It could have been opened and closed at speeds up to 30 mph (48 kph). Inside, the cabin offered the same spacious environment as the coupe. Moreover, McLaren installed the roof with an adjustable tinting glass. That allowed the occupants to increase or lower the interior luminosity according to their preferences. In front of the driver, the carmaker added the same tilt-down instrument cluster that showed only minimum info when it was lowered, for the race-track, or a complete TFT display that also displayed the rear-view camera when backing up. With a carbon-fiber monocoque and its experience in creating open-top race cars, the McLaren 720S was stiffer than many other closed-roof coupes on the market. Its performances were lowered, with the top down, to 202 mph (325 kph), while the top speed remained the same as on the coupe.",MCLAREN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""720S"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""spacious"",  ""overall-design"": [""triangular-shaped headlights"", ""sleek bodywork"", ""concealed safety arches"", ""electrically operated roof"", ""adjustable tinting glass""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""sleek""],    ""headlights"": [""triangular-shaped"", ""black background""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""electrically operated"", ""concealed safety arches"", ""adjustable tinting glass""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MCLAREN GT,"The 2019 McLaren GT was created to enter into a market dominated by front-engined GT cars. The McLaren GT had a mid-engine and rear-wheel-drive powertrain, featuring a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox. At almost 4.7 meters (15.4 ft) in length, the McLaren GT is longer than any other vehicle made by the British car manufacturer. It sits on 20” light-alloy wheels in the front, which are paired with 21” for the rear wheels. Inside, the McLaren GT struggled to offer maximum comfort and luxury. The leather bucket seats could be covered in Nappa leather trim fitted as standard or could be upgraded to softgrain luxury leather or Alcantara, depending on vehicle specification. A 12.3” TFT screen was placed in front of the driver, as an instrument cluster. The information showed there could be chosen by the driver, offering almost full customization, but the central tachometer with a digital speedometer was always displayed. Usually, a GT doesn't have too much trunk space. The McLaren GT had two trunks: a bigger one in the back, on top of the engine, and another “frunk” in the front. The total space was 570 liters (20.1 cu-ft), which is more than most of the sedan trunks. The 4.0-liter V8 twin-turbo engine developed 620 hp, which were more than enough to transform the GT into a supercar, especially since the overall weight was only 1530 kg (3373 lbs).",MCLAREN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""McLaren GT"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""4.7 meters in length"",  ""overall-design"": [""mid-engine"", ""rear-wheel-drive"", ""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""long"", ""sleek""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""20” light-alloy in front"", ""21” for the rear""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MCLAREN 750S,"After five years on the market, the 720S was replaced by the 750S in 2023, and while at first sight, they looked the same, the newer version boasted a 30% transformation in its parts compared with its predecessor. The British automaker was well-known for its high-performance products. In addition, its name was highly respected on the Formula 1 grid. Thus, it had all the attributes to start making a new vehicle able to compete against any other Italian or American supercars. With the 750S, it also created its most powerful vehicle made to that date. McLaren kept the overall shape of the 720S when it made the 750S but with a few noticeable differences. Thus, the front fascia sported narrower eye-socket intakes and a longer splitter adorned by side scoops. These were fully functional and channeled air onto the front rotors to cool the brakes. On the sides, the coupe kept a clean line for the bodywork, with waved shapes and an exhaust vent behind the front fenders. The car's curved greenhouse was pushed forward, and its sloped-down rear side featured a windscreen narrowed on the lower side and a set of vents needed to cool the engine. Finally, at the back, an active carbon-fiber wing added not just a touch of sportiness but also enhanced the downforce. Inside, the automaker installed all the features needed by a modern supercar, such as the TFT display inside the instrument cluster and a driver-oriented, portrait-mode touchscreen incorporated into the center stack. The carbon-fiber sports seats and the center console created a racy interior and could've been fitted with Alcantara and leather.

MCLAREN Speedtail,"After creating the P1 and Senna, McLaren launched the third member of the Ultimate Series, the 2018 Speedtail, a hypercar that could beat a Bugatti in almost any performance results, apart from the top speed. When the British car manufacturer unveiled the Speedtail, the car revealed many connections with its grandfather, the iconic McLaren F1. And, just like its illustrious ancestor, the 2018 vehicle featured advanced technologies for its time, and it was the fastest McLaren ever built, although it only passed the top speed of the F1 by just 7 miles per hour (10 kph). But that was not the point. The engineering details made the Speedtail stand apart from any other direct competitors. It was neither a form-followed-purpose concept nor a purpose-followed-form one; it was a best of both worlds neither of its competitors could achieve. The fluid shapes of the bodywork were carefully crafted and tested in the wind tunnel to the maximum. Its short nose, teardrop-shaped greenhouse, and long rear end, hence the Speedtail name, created an incredibly low drag coefficient. At the front, the LED headlights resembled the same shape as those installed on the rest of the McLaren vehicles and formed, together with the side scoops, a C-shape. Underneath the bumper, the automaker placed a carbon-fiber splitter with a V-shaped element in the middle that channeled the air toward the side intakes. From its profile, the car featured a unique, distinctive look with its caps that covered the front wheels to lower the drag coefficient. Behind them, on the rear side of the fenders, the automaker placed extracting vents to release the pressure within the wheel wells. Furthermore, the ascending curved line above them created a ponton-like element that continued the vehicle's shape toward its back and also formed the upper sides of the rear fenders. Finally, at the rear, the extended rear overhang featured a functional diffuser and a set of fins and vents that also served to decrease the ground effect. Inside, customers could find a McLaren F1-style cockpit. The driver's seat was in the middle, and it was flanked, in recessed positions, by the passengers' bucket seats. Fronting the driver was a digital instrument cluster flanked on the left by the touchscreen for the HVAC and the infotainment unit's touch panel on the right. Above the driver were the start/stop, the gear selectors (PRND), and the power window buttons. It was a unique solution, unseen in other cars. The carefully crafted carbon fiber elements surrounded the cabin, and McLaren used this material for the seats, door cards, shift paddles, and steering wheel. But the most essential part of the 2018 Speedtail was under its engine cover, placed behind the cabin. There, McLaren installed a hybrid system powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 and helped by an electric motor that produced 1050 PS (1036 hp) and could accelerate the car from a standstill to 300 kph (186 mph) in just 12.8 seconds. And that was faster than any other production car on the road.",MCLAREN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Speedtail"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""fluid"", ""aerodynamic"", ""sleek"", ""innovative"", ""distinctive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""teardrop-shaped"", ""low-profile""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""short""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""C-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [""carbon-fiber"", ""V-shaped""],    ""wheel"": [""covered"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""doors"": [""McLaren F1-style""],    ""roof"": [""carbon-fiber""],    ""diffusor"": [""functional""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""hybrid"", ""twin-turbocharged""]  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG GLA,"Ever since the third generation of the A-Class, Mercedes-Benz offered an AMG version, and that idea was carried over to the next models based on the same platform, such as the GLA. When the German automaker introduced the first GLA in 2013 (the X156), it proved that sometimes smaller is better. Then, the AMG version appeared, enhancing the lineup, and that was an undercover rally car fit for tackling gravel roads like there's no tomorrow. But then, the second generation of the GLA showed up in 2019, which was also granted with a Mercedes-AMG version refreshed in the Spring of 2023. On the 2024 model-year Mercedes-AMG GLA 35, the compact crossover sported a new Panamericana grille at the front instead of the one with a single, horizontal bar that crossed the grille from side to side on the rest of the GLA lineup. Its redesigned LED headlights were shared with its stablemates, but the lower bumper looked different with its horizontal slats inside the side scoops and the lower grille. From its profile, the car boasted its standard 19"" light-alloy wheels, while the automaker offered wheels of up to 21"" in diameter. Finally, at the back, the redesigned taillights featured LED technology and a different layout than its non-facelifted sibling. Inside, the five-seat GLA provided enough room for four adults or five on short jaunts. Its leather-wrapped cabin offered a sense of luxury enhanced further by the look of the illuminated turbine-like vents from the dashboard. But the upgrades didn't stop there and went a little bit more with the augmented reality MBAUX infotainment unit that boasted a 10.25"" inch display. For the drivetrain, Mercedes-AMG installed a turbocharged two-liter gasoline powerplant that sent its grunt in all corners via an AMG SPEEDSHIFT DCT 8G (eight-speed, dual-clutch) transmission. In addition, an integrated starter-generator that worked on the 48v architecture added 10 kW (13 hp) to the package.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""GLA"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""compact crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""compact"", ""sporty"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""Panamericana"", ""refreshed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""redesigned""],    ""bumper"": [""horizontal slats""],    ""wheel"": [""19\"" light-alloy"", ""up to 21\""""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG GT Coupe,"In the summer of 2023, Mercedes-AMG launched the second generation of one of the most famous products, the GT Coupe. The automaker introduced this nameplate in 2014 and kept it alive until 2023. But after nine years and around 18,900 units sold, the model needed a much-deserved retirement paving the way for the new generation, the C192. The 2024 GT Coupe shared its underpinnings with the 2024 Mercedes-Benz SL, but everything else was different. At the front, the car featured the Panamericana grille specific for vehicles built in Affalterbach. It was flanked by functional side scoops that channeled the air from the front of the vehicle to the front discs to cool them. In addition, they created an air curtain that lowered the drag resistance. On the flared front fenders, behind the wheels, the car manufacturer installed extracting vents. The hood boasted two power domes that reflected the V-shaped engine underneath it. Since Mercedes-AMG built the GT Coupe as a grand tourer, it carefully crafted the greenhouse with a raked windshield followed by an arched roofline with an option for a panoramic glass roof. It was extended to the rear by a sloped windscreen mounted on the tailgate. The car sported a wing at the back that added downforce to the vehicle at higher speeds. The rear fascia was adorned by a set of elliptic-shaped taillights connected by a light strip. Under the bumper, the GT Coupe featured a wide diffuser that incorporated four squared exhausts. Inside, Mercedes-AMG installed a 2+2 cabin layout suitable for four occupants. While the front sports seats provided enough comfort for long journeys, the rear ones were suitable just for persons up to 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) tall. Still, these were flat-folding, thus expanding the trunk space. The car manufacturer focused more on the driver's seat and installed a thick, three-spoke steering wheel filled with touch buttons and additional controls. Inside the instrument cluster, Mercedes-AMG placed a 3D display for main information about driving conditions. In addition, an 11.9"" touchscreen for the MBUX infotainment unit provided all the necessary features and controls for the sat-nav, telephone, and sound system. But, just like any other performance car produced by Mercedes-AMG, the most significant part was hidden under the vehicle's skin. The automaker offered the GT Coupe in two versions: the GT 55 4Matic+ and the GT 63 4Matic+. It was the first time in the model's history that it was available exclusively with an all-wheel-drive system. Both versions shared the same 4.0-liter V8 power plant, helped by a pair of turbochargers placed between the cylinder banks (hot-V). Like in any other AMG vehicle, these engines were hand built and signed by a single engineer. Mercedes-AMG was famous for its ""One Man, One Engine"" policy. Power went into all corners via a 9-speed (dual-clutch) gearbox fitted with a wet starting clutch to protect the drivetrain.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""GT Coupe"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""grand tourer"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""athletic"", ""modern"", ""aggressive"", ""aerodynamic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [""Panamericana""],    ""hood"": [""power domes""],    ""headlights"": [""elliptic-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [""wide"", ""incorporated diffuser""],    ""wheel"": [""flared"", ""behind-wheel extracting vents""],    ""doors"": [""2+2 cabin layout""],    ""roof"": [""arched"", ""option for panoramic glass""],    ""diffusor"": [""wide"", ""four squared exhausts""],    ""spoiler"": [""wing at the back""],    ""exhaust"": [""four squared""]  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG GT 4-DOOR COUPE,"In the spring of 2023, Mercedes-AMG introduced a mild facelift for its four-door coupe GT 4Matic+, the versions powered by the inline-six biturbo powerplant. The model was launched in 2018 and already refreshed once in 2020. But that didn't stop the German automaker from adding a newer version of it just three years later after that. It didn't go too much with the updates, but still, it considered that some customers would ditch their already ""old-looking"" 2020 models and replace them with the newer version. In the 2023 model year, the four-door coupe made by Mercedes-AMG sported a new front fascia with wider side scoops that sported a jet-wing design. In addition, small black winglets channeled more air inside those air intakes to cool the brakes. These flanked the center lower air intake that resembled a wing from an aircraft. For those looking for more aggressive styling, the automaker offered the option for a V8 styling package, which made the inline-six versions of the four-door coupe look like its more powerful brother. Starting with the 2023 model year, the car offered a standard sliding glass roof and, on the center console, a wireless charger. But what was good in the cabin didn't change. The high-bolstered bucket seats at the front were both comfortable and looked awesome, while the rear bench seat was still profiled for two. Under the hood, the six-cylinder version of the four-door coupe made by Mercedes-AMG was available in two power versions. The base model was the named GT 43 4Matic+ and offered 367 PS (362 hp), while its more powerful sibling, named GT 53 4Matic+, boasted a total of 435 PS (429 hp). Both versions were helped by a 16 kW (21 PS) integrated starter-generator (ISG).",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""GT 4Matic+"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""four-door coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""mild facelift"", ""aggressive styling"", ""jet-wing design"", ""high-bolstered bucket seats"", ""sliding glass roof""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""new front fascia"", ""wider side scoops"", ""small black winglets""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""center lower air intake""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""wireless charger""],    ""roof"": [""sliding glass roof""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG GLE  Coupe,"Beginning in 2023, Mercedes-AMG unveiled a revised model of the GLE's fourth generation for the 2024 model year; however, the engine remained the same. While the inline-six turbocharged engine in the Mercedes-Benz sister was upgraded, the GLE 53's exterior and interior were updated to make it more appealing to customers. The GLE Coupe is now safer than it was previously, thanks to specific features the automaker installed at the same time. The German carmaker kept its commitment to keep the GLE Coupe's appearance modern while still making it simple to identify as a genuine AMG badge wearer. Thus, the Panamericana-grille with its vertical chromed slats was displayed on the front fascia. The multibeam-LED headlights, which had four light blocks, were one of the most obvious differences from its predecessor. A bigger lower lip spoiler was also added to the reworked lower bumper. The GLE 53 also had brand-new LED taillights with horizontal lighting at the back. The large SUV had four oval pipes flanking the rear diffuser at the back. The carmaker replaced the outdated dual-screen on the dashboard with an improved model inside. The same piece of glass served as the cover for both displays—those for the infotainment system and the instrument panel—providing a cohesive appearance. However, only the latter had touchscreen capabilities. As was to be expected, AMG provided brand-specific features for the MBAUX system that provided more details about the settings and performance of the vehicle. The company fitted a three-liter, inline-six engine under the hood that produced 435 horsepower (429 PS). Power was distributed to all four corners via the nine-speed automatic transmission.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""GLE"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""modern"", ""sleek"", ""sporty"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""Panamericana"", ""vertical"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [""reworked""],    ""headlights"": [""multibeam-LED"", ""four light blocks""],    ""bumper"": [""reworked"", ""bigger lower lip spoiler""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""rear"", ""flanking the rear""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""four oval pipes""],    ""interior"": [""improved dual-screen dashboard"", ""cohesive appearance"", ""touchscreen capabilities"", ""luxurious"", ""brand-specific features"", ""MBAUX system""]  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG GLS- Class,"Mercedes-AMG introduced a facelifted version of the GLS 63 in the spring of 2023, along with the rest of the GLS family produced by Mercedes-Benz. While some people could live just fine with the power provided by the regular GLS, some others asked for more. Thus, the AMG produced the GLS 63 that was not just big and luxurious, but it could also hit the 62 mph mark (100 kph) from standing still in less time than other supercars built just a decade before. And that wasn't easy, considering the vehicle's size and weight. Boasting a broader grille at the front adorned by the specific Panamericana styling with vertical slats, the GLS 63 had an aggressive look. Its headlights, similar to those on the rest of the range, boasted two boomerang-shaped daytime running lights and two LED blocks inside the headlamps. The massive SUV came fitted as standard with 21"" light-alloy wheels, with an option for a set of 23"" ones. At the back, the automaker installed new 3D taillights, and at the lower part, a bumper with a diffuser flanked by two pairs of quad-exhaust trims. The actual pipes were round and placed behind the bumper. Inside, the GLS 63 featured an updated dashboard with a wide glass panel that covered a new digital instrument panel and the MBUX infotainment's system touchscreen. The latter was placed atop the center stack. Since it was a performance-oriented vehicle, it featured a pair of bolstered front seats, while the rest of the five seats (three on the middle row and two jump seats in the trunk area) were regular. But all of them were wrapped in artificial leather. Along with the upgraded version, AMG ditched the former drivetrain used on the 2016 model-year and brought a 4.0-liter biturbo V8 mated with a nine-speed automatic gearbox.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""GLS 63"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""big, massive, luxurious"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""luxurious"", ""performance-oriented""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broader"", ""Panamericana styling"", ""vertical slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""boomerang-shaped"", ""LED blocks""],    ""bumper"": [""diffuser"", ""quad-exhaust trims""],    ""wheel"": [""21\"" light-alloy"", ""23\"" optional""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""round"", ""quad"", ""behind the bumper""]  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG GLC  Coupe,"Mercedes-Benz introduced the second generation of the GLC in the Fall of 2022, and in the Spring of 2023, it unveiled its Coupé sibling. And then, just a few weeks later, Mercedes-AMG released its performance versions: the GLC43 and the GLC63. The new generation of Mercedes-AMG GLC43 Coupé was not exactly a surprise for the market, and the three-pointed star brand’s fans awaited it. After a treatment in the Affalterbach AMG’s facility, the compact SUV became more aggressive, more luxurious, and most importantly, more powerful. Even if it wasn’t the most outrageous version of the family, it could still provide enough oomph to enter into the sports car territory. But customers had to deal with the idea of having a four-pot under the hood instead of a V6 like on its predecessor. AMG didn’t want its cars to pass unnoticed, so it began with the main grille on the GLC Coupé. As a result, it featured a Panamericana design with vertical slats. Underneath it, the automaker installed its specific A-shaped lower grille flanked by massive pentagonal-shaped side scoops. The headlights looked slightly different than those installed on the regular, non-AMG GLC, with single-line LED daytime running lights on their upper side. From its profile, the car manufacturer installed a set of 19” wheels with options for 20” or 21” ones. AMG also added a new set of aerodynamically profiled side sills. Finally, at the back, the automaker added a rear apron with a diffuser look flanked by two pairs of round tailpipes on each side of the vehicle. Like any other AMG-labeled Mercedes product, the GLC43 Coupé featured specific, high-bolstered seats at the front upholstered in ARTICO man-made leather and Microcut AMG microfiber materials. These gave the car an upscale yet sporty look. Moreover, the driver fronted a flat-bottom steering wheel wrapped in perforated Nappa leather fitted with two aluminum paddle shifters behind it. On the center stack, the automaker installed a portrait-mode display for the MBUX infotainment system. Unlike the rest of the GLC range, this one featured additional menus and a “Supersport” style, allowing customers to display various contents vertically. Between the front occupants, the automaker placed a tall center console finished with piano-black trims and housing a storage compartment under the armrest. Behind, for the rear passengers, Mercedes-AMG installed an ARTICO/Microcut AMG microfiber-wrapped split-folding bench seat. Under the hood, the car manufacturer ditched the former V6 engine and installed an electrified powerplant consisting of a two-liter turbocharged inline-four. It was fitted with a belt-driven starter-generator (RSG) that ensured not just a smooth transition between driving situations but also added an instant dose of torque when the driver pushed the accelerator all the way down. The system was paired with an AMG Speedshift MCT (multi-clutch technology) nine-speed automatic transmission that sent the power in all corners via a fixed 31:69 ratio.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mercedes-AMG GLC43 Coupé"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""luxurious"", ""powerful"", ""sporty"", ""upscale""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""Panamericana design"", ""vertical slats""],    ""hood"": [""A-shaped lower grille"", ""massive pentagonal-shaped side scoops""],    ""headlights"": [""single-line LED daytime running lights""],    ""bumper"": [""rear apron with diffuser look""],    ""wheel"": [""19” wheels"", ""options for 20” or 21” ones""],    ""doors"": [""high-bolstered seats"", ""upholstered in ARTICO man-made leather and Microcut AMG microfiber materials""],    ""roof"": [""flat-bottom steering wheel"", ""perforated Nappa leather"", ""aluminum paddle shifters""],    ""diffusor"": [""aerodynamically profiled side sills""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""two pairs of round tailpipes""]  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG CLA Shooting brake,"Mercedes-AMG unveiled in January 2023 a facelift for its CLA range, in both sedan and long-roof shape, where the latter version was named Shooting Brake. Four years after the introduction of the Shooting Brake version for the second generation of the CLA Coupe, the German automaker made an important step forward by adding a facelift for the entire range. Besides the exterior and interior upgrades, the 2024 model-year CLA 35 4Matic Shooting Brake also received improvements for the drivetrain. Sporting the same Panamericana grille as the rest of the AMG range, the CLA 35 4Matic Shooting Brake was also fitted with the new, redesigned LED headlights as the rest of the CLA range, produced either under AMG or Mercedes-Benz badge. From its sides, the car looked similar to its Coupe sibling, albeit it was different from the B-pillars rearward. There, the arched and slightly sloped-down roof line was extended behind the C-pillars onto the raked-forward D-pillars that ended the vehicle with a curved tailgate. Changes continued on the interior, where the automaker introduced new color combinations for the upholstery. Thus, from 2023, this version was available with either gray-black or red-black combinations. On the dashboard, the automaker installed two 10.25” screens behind a commonly-shared glass, leaving the impression of a continuous wide display. The one fronting the driver was used for the instrument panel, while the one mounted atop the center stack featured touch functions and was used for the infotainment system. Under the hood, beside the belt-driven starter-generator, stood the same transversely-mounted inline-four turbocharged powerplant that sent the power in all corners via a new AMG SPEEDSHIFT DCT 8G automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox. Thanks to the new drivetrain, the CLA 35 4Matic Shooting Brake could push the car from 0 to 100 kph (0-62 mph) in a mere 4.9 seconds.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""CLA 35 4Matic Shooting Brake"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""sporty"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""Panamericana""],    ""hood"": [""curved""],    ""headlights"": [""redesigned"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sleek""],    ""roof"": [""arched"", ""sloped-down"", ""extended""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual""]  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG GLE,"While its non-AMG sibling, Mercedes-Benz GLE, went through some major changes regarding the drivetrain, the performance SUV was left with the same engine and transmission, which provided plenty of power anyway. But that didn't stop customers from asking why they didn't get more ponies for the new model. Mercedes-AMG improved the GLE 53's look, keeping the vehicle's image up to date even four years after the model's introduction in 2019. At the front, the Panamericana-grille supported the redesigned company's badge in the middle, which sported a single ring around Mercedes' three-pointed star. In addition, the lower bumper was redesigned, and the side scoops received new inner sides compared with their predecessors. Most importantly, the multibeam LED headlights sported four blocks for the daytime running lights that replaced the previously used double-arrow pattern. Finally, at the back, the car got new lines instead of circles around the inner side of the taillights. The carmaker replaced the outdated dual-screen on the dashboard with an improved model inside. The same piece of glass served as the cover for both displays—those for the infotainment system and the instrument panel—providing a cohesive appearance. However, only the latter had touchscreen capabilities. As was to be expected, AMG provided brand-specific features for the MBAUX system that provided more details about the settings and performance of the vehicle.

Mercedes-AMG CLA-Class,"For those who didn't really want the hard-core version of the CLA 45 Coupe, the German automaker had made the 35, which still posted an under five seconds 0 to 62 mph (0-100 kph) time. Introduced in January 2023 for the 2024 model year, the facelifted version of the Mercedes-AMG CLA 35 Coupe came with a few improvements on the exterior, interior, and under the hood. Even though it was powered by the same turbocharged powerplant as its non-facelifted sibling, it was helped by a belt-driven starter generator. The car came fitted with a similar-looking Panamericana grille like its more powerful sibling, the 45 S 4Matic+. Mercedes-AMG made just small changes between these models, with the lesser-powered sibling featuring fewer add-ons on the bumper and sides. A significant difference was on the wheels, where the lesser-powered sibling sported ten-spoke, 18"" light-alloy wheels, whereas the 45 S 4Matic+ came fitted with a set of five-spoke 19"" ones. Just like the rest of the CLA range, whether we're talking about Mercedes-Benz or the Mercedes-AMG, all of them came with new and improved LED headlights. Inside, the AMG 35 received new colors for the upholstery with either gray-black or red-black combinations. The sports seats with high-bolstered areas were also offered in the standard package, and so were the two 10.25"" screens that adorned the top of the dash, where one was used for the instrument panel and the other for the infotainment system. Under the hood, beside the belt-driven starter-generator, stood the same transversely-mounted inline-four turbocharged powerplant that sent the power in all corners via a new AMG SPEEDSHIFT DCT 8G automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox.

Mercedes-AMG GLB,"Along with the introduction of the facelifted version of the Mercedes-Benz GLB in 2023, Mercedes-AMG also refreshed its designated version, the GLB 35. Like most other models built by the German automaker, the GLB was also granted an AMG-badged version. This, unlike the rest of the range, aimed at customers who didn't want just a luxurious crossover to crawl through city traffic and park over a curb. Its engine, transmission, suspension, and steering could have been put into sport mode so the one behind the wheel could drift the car on a gravel road. And it could do all of that while still being turned back at the flick of a switch back into comfort mode and do the school runs safely and comfortably. The car manufacturer upgraded the GLB and installed LED headlights on the entire range. In addition, since it was an AMG version, the car's front fascia featured this brand's specific lower apron that featured a trapezoidal grille flanked by two scoops meant to coll the brakes. In addition, it offered light-alloy wheels of up to 21"" in diameter, compared to the maximum 19"" ones offered on the rest of the GLB range. Finally, at the back, the AMG GLB 35 featured two round exhausts that flanked a black diffuser placed underneath the bumper. Inside, it was more than just a regular compact-segment crossover. Besides the option for a seven-seat cabin, like its stablemates, it also provided high-bolstered seats at the front. Its leather-wrapped cabin offered a sense of luxury that was enhanced furthermore by the look of the illuminated turbine-like vents from the dashboard. But the upgrades didn't stop there and went a little bit more with the augmented reality MBAUX infotainment unit that boasted a 10.25"" inch display. For the drivetrain, Mercedes-AMG installed a turbocharged two-liter gasoline powerplant that sent its grunt in all corners via an AMG SPEEDSHIFT DCT 8G (eight-speed, dual-clutch) transmission. In addition, an integrated starter-generator that worked on the 48v architecture added 10 kW (13 hp) to the package.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mercedes-Benz GLB"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""upgraded"", ""high-tech"", ""dynamic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""trapezoidal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""black"", ""diffuser""],    ""wheel"": [""light-alloy"", ""21-inch""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""black""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""round""]  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG C-CLASS,"Mercedes-AMG took the excellent 2.0-liter turbocharged powerplant developed for the A-Class, rotated it by 90 degrees, and installed it into the engine bay of the C-Class, thus resulting in a performance-oriented compact sedan: the C 43. When the downsizing trend started, AMG was caught off-guard. In those times, it was focused on big powerplants with up to 7.3-liter displacement. But its engineers went back to the drawing board and made one of the best inline-four engines in the world: a 2.0-liter inline-four, which they planted into the A-Class hatchback and turned into a successful story. In 2022, they tried the same with the C-Class. Unlike its non-AMG sibling from Mercedes-Benz, the C43 sported a much-more aggressive front fascia, with the Panamericana grille and the AMG-specific lower front apron, where the A-shaped lower grille flanked by a pair of air-intakes enhanced both the look and the car's aerodynamic. Furthermore, on the front fenders, the Turbo-electrified badges were an accurate statement of the technology comprised in the vehicle. Inside, the sport bucket seats at the front covered in ARTICO man-made leather offered high bolstered areas that kept their occupants in place during high-speed cornering. Like its regular, non-AMG sibling, the C43 showed a two-screen dashboard, with one in front of the driver as an instrument panel and a touchscreen atop the center stack for the MBUX infotainment system. The three-spoke steering wheel with the flat-bottom area was thick and covered with Alcantara for better grip. Under the hood, AMG installed the longitudinal version of the four-cylinder 2.0-liter powerplant developed for the A-Class. It was helped by an electric turbocharger, a technology developed for Formula 1. Power went in all corners via a nine-speed automatic gearbox.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""C 43"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""compact sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""sporty"", ""aerodynamic"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""Panamericana"", ""aggressive""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""AMG-specific"", ""lower front apron""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG CLS-Class,"Mercedes-AMG introduced a facelifted version for the third CLS generation in 2021 and added more technology to the sporty four-door coupe. Since the rest of the range received some improvements, it seemed natural to see some improvements for the CLS AMG 53. There were some, but less than expected. Maybe the most important technical detail was the drop of the rear-wheel-drive 53 AMG versions. Thus, the carmaker admitted that after some point, the sporty four-door-coupe needed an all-wheel-drive system. Since the rest of the rang took the AMG-styling as a standard, the true performance model had to come with something different. And it did, by introducing the Panamericana grille with vertical slats. The carmaker made the windshield's surroundings from polished aluminum or, in combination with the Night Package, in high-gloss black. Inside, the AMG featured carbon-fiber trims for the dashboard, center stack, center console, and door panels. The sport bucket seats with high bolstering were fitted as standard. Another major improvement was for the dashboard, which sported a pair of 12.3"" screens under the same glass area for the new infotainment system and the instrument panel. A touch-pad replaced the previously used controller for the MBAUX interface and brought AI-enhanced functions that helped the driver. Unlike the rest of the CLS range, the AMG version featured different driving modes, including a drift function, which seemed to be demanded by its customers. Unfortunately for its fans, the CLS 53 AMG featured the same drivetrain as before, with a 453 hp combined output.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""CLS AMG 53"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""four-door coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""performance"", ""stylish"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""polished aluminum"", ""high-gloss black""],    ""grille"": [""Panamericana"", ""vertical slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""carbon-fiber trims""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""drift function""]  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG C-CLASS COUPE,"The fourth generation of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class was unveiled in 2014. Four years later, the range received a facelift and the C43 version for all of its shapes: sedan, station-wagon, convertible, and coupe. Ever since the first AMG was created, the German brand wanted to make a clear statement of performance and exclusivity. That recipe was continued to all the models that wore the AMG badge on them. The 2018 C43 Coupe was no exception and since it was the first C-Class coupe, it had to show it properly. In the front, the twin-louver AMG radiator grille was a significant visual improvement over the lesser version of the C-Class Coupe. The front apron featured new additional air-intakes to improve the air-flow to the engine, for cooling. From the side, the specific AMG side sills were aerodynamically sculptured. On top of the trunk-lid, a body-colored lip-spoiler was installed. Inside, the leather, microfiber materials, and aluminum were the most obvious materials used to craft the sporty, yet elegant, C-Class Coupe AMG. The door panels and the dashboard were covered in Artico man-made leather. The instrument cluster was available either with regular round dials or a new, fully configurable 12.3” display. As part of the AMG line, the steering wheel was different than the rest of the C-Class range, with a thicker, grippy, and flat-bottom shape. The C43 AMG was available only with all-wheel-drive system 4Matic, with a front/rear torque split of 31:69. The 3.0-liter V6 engine was mated to a standard AMG Speedshift TCT 9G gearbox, with 9 gears. It was an evolved version from the standard 9G-Tronic, double-clutch, gearbox.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mercedes-Benz C-Class"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""elegant"", ""exclusive"", ""aerodynamic"", ""performance""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""twin-louver"", ""AMG""],    ""hood"": [""sculptured""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""front apron"", ""air-intakes""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""leather"", ""microfiber"", ""elegant""],    ""roof"": [""body-colored lip-spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""aerodynamic"", ""body-colored""],    ""exhaust"": [""evolved""]  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG E-Class Coupe,"Mercedes-AMG introduced the E53 in 2018 and, in 2020, it came with the facelift version. Some considered it to be released too early. But it was necessary, due to the imminent introduction of the Euro 6d norms. The AMG brand started as an independent tuner, specialized for Mercedes-Benz vehicles. Over time, the German carmaker acquired the small independent company from Afallterbach and transformed it into an in-house manufacturer as a different brand. The E53 AMG was based on the Mercedes-Benz E-Class Coupe. But it was more than just a re-badged car. AMG dramatically restyled the E53 AMG coupe with new, sharp-cut, full-LED headlamps. The powerdomes on the hood amplified the powerful impression. The front apron's center section was drawn into an A shape and created a larger air intake for the five vertical struts grille. The outer air-scoops featured two transverse slats that were extended to the splitter. In the back, twin oval tailpipes were installed. The arched roofline sloped to the rear was kept the same, without other mods. For the interior, the AMG E53 offered a luxurious yet sporty atmosphere. The two displays on the instrument cluster and the multimedia system blended under the Widescreen Cockpit's joint glass cover. The driver could choose between three AMG display styles: ""Modern Classic,"" ""Sport,"" and ""Supersport."" The engine was a twin-turbo, inline-six engine. An air-compressor helped the turbochargers to get to their boost level faster. Also, there was additional help from the EQ Boost starter-generator. Thanks to the 48v electric system, the car had enough juice in the batteries to give the vehicle an extra 16kW (21 hp) and 250 Nm (184.3 lb-ft) of torque when needed. And at any kick down, thanks to the Speedshift TCT 9G transmission, the engine revs up fast.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""E53"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""sharp-cut full-LED headlamps"", ""powerdomes on hood"", ""A-shaped front apron"", ""twin oval tailpipes"", ""luxurious yet sporty interior""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""five vertical struts""],    ""hood"": [""powerdomes""],    ""headlights"": [""sharp-cut"", ""full-LED""],    ""bumper"": [""larger air intake""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""arched roofline""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""twin oval tailpipes""]  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG E-Class,"Finally, the new era and interior technology caught up with the E 53. Interior enhancements and some subtle outside modifications made the facelift much more worthy than just a few extra colors or light-alloy wheels in the option list. The hood now has two powerdomes, suggesting that there is a V-type engine in there. Actually, there is an inline-six unit with the same big turbocharger helped by an electric compressor to cut the turbo-lag. The total output of the powerplant can be translated into 435 hp and 520 Nm (383.5 lb-ft) of torque. The transmission is the same  AMG SPEEDSHIFT TCT 9G paired with the 4MATIC+ system, which allows not only a variable front/rear torque distribution but also from left to right at the rear. Inside, the infotainment system has been upgraded from the former COMMAND to the new MBUX. It features touch-screen controls and a better connectivity with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. This system works in coordination with the complex instrument cluster. The two displays for the instrument cluster and MBUX displays blend beneath a shared glass cover to form the Widescreen Cockpit. Via the AMG menu, the driver can call up various special displays such as Engine Data, gear speed indicator, Warm-up, Set-up, G-Meter and RACETIMER. The MBUX Augmented Reality function also allows the ideal racing line of a stored race track to be displayed on the multimedia display or optional head-up display, allowing the driver to improve lap times with a virtual instructor on board.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""E 53"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""subtle outside modifications"", ""two powerdomes on hood"", ""Widescreen Cockpit""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""powerdomes""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG E-Class Cabriolet,"Mercedes-AMG introduced the convertible version of the AMG E53 Coupe in 2018 but, to comply with the Euro 6d regulations, it had to be refreshed. That is why the E53 received a facelift in 2020. The AMG brand started as an independent tuner, specialized for Mercedes-Benz vehicles.

Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster,"While the AMG GT Coupe was more of a daily-driver supercar, its open-top brother was more of a GT with high performances. In 2014, AMG launched its first product that was named AMG instead of Mercedes-Benz AMG. It was a car like no other in the Mercedes-Benz manufacturer lineup. The supercar was offered with the most powerful naturally aspirated engine on the market at its launch. In 2016 came the first facelift and the convertible version, and four years later, a new refresh for the lineup was introduced. The 2020 model featured some exterior changes to enhance the look and the car's aerodynamic. The full-LED headlights became a standard feature, and a new grille design was installed. The front bumper was divided into three main areas: the lower grille and the side-intakes. The latter was split in two by a horizontal slat. The car's back was slightly improved, but the four exhaust pipes were left visible, poking out through the rear apron. The interior featured a carbon-fiber trim on the center console and the dashboard. The instrument cluster was entirely digital, with a 12.3"" TFT color-display. An additional screen was placed on top of the center stack for the infotainment system. It was controlled via voice commands, a touch-pad, or via the 10.3"" touch-screen. The Apple CarPlay and the Android Auto integration was fitted as standard. The 2020 AMG GT featured a twin-turbo V8 engine that offered 469 hp. The GT C variant received 550 hp, and the top-spec GT R and GT R Pro received the 577 hp unit. All versions were paired to a 7-speed, dual-clutch, automatic transmission. Power went to the rear wheels, and the gearbox was mounted in the back.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""AMG GT"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""powerful"", ""aerodynamic"", ""modern"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""new"", ""distinctive""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""full-LED""],    ""bumper"": [""divided"", ""three main areas""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""visible"", ""four pipes""]  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG GLC-Class,"Mercedes-AMG expanded the range of the GLC Coupe lineup in 2023 when it introduced the GLC S E Performance version, an electrified model that aimed to provide similar performance to the previous GLC63 S but with improved fuel efficiency. Mercedes-AMG was committed to lowering the emissions of its cars, and that’s why it started to create electrified, high-performance vehicles. As a result, after Mercedes-Benz introduced the GLC in the Fall of 2022, the performance marque of the three-pointed star brand started to work on the higher-spec versions of this model. As a result, in the Summer of 2023, it unveiled both the GLC43 and the GLC 63 S E Performance versions. The latter carried over the drivetrain from the AMG C63S, with which the GLC shared its platform. The car manufacturer from Affalterbach reserved its rights to offer the GLC 63 S E Performance with a unique color, the high-tech silver magno. AMG installed its own badge on the hood and, lower, the specific Panamericana-style grille with vertical slats. These were available either with a chromed finish or black for the Night package II option. Lower on the bumper, in the apron, the A-shaped lower grille featured vertical and horizontal slats and was flanked by large scoops that vented the front rotors. From its profile, the side skirts and the big, 20” light alloy wheels. At the back, the car boasted a center-mounted diffuser under the bumper flanked by four rectangular exhausts. Inside, the automaker placed carbon fiber trims around the dashboard that matched perfectly with the aluminum parts from the door cards and center console. Fronting the driver was a digital instrument cluster. In addition, atop the center stack, the automaker placed the MBUX infotainment unit with a portrait-mode touchscreen. The center console housed a few storage areas and the center armrest. Unlike the rest of the GLC range, this one featured additional menus and a “Supersport” style, allowing customers to display various contents vertically. Between the front occupants, the automaker placed a tall center console finished with piano-black trims and housing a storage compartment under the armrest. On the rear flat-folding (60/40), the bench seat was roomy enough for three adults but with limited legroom for the middle-seated one due to the center tunnel. Mercedes-AMG ditched the formerly used 4.0-liter V8 and installed a turbocharged four-pot engine helped by an electric motor and a belt-driven starter generator (RSG). As a result, it provided 680 PS (671 HP), which was 170 PS (168 HP) more than its predecessor. The new unit sent its power in all corners via an AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT (multi-clutch technology) 9G gearbox and variable torque distribution between the front and rear axle. Furthermore, it also benefited from a wet-clutch system for the launch control.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""GLC Coupe"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""mid-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""electrified"", ""high-performance"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""angled""],    ""grille"": [""Panamericana-style"", ""vertical slats"", ""chromed"", ""black""],    ""hood"": [""AMG badge""],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""A-shaped lower grille"", ""large scoops"", ""center-mounted diffuser""],    ""wheel"": [""20” light alloy""],    ""doors"": [""carbon fiber trims"", ""aluminum parts""],    ""roof"": [""flat-folding""],    ""diffusor"": [""center-mounted""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""four rectangular""]  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG C-CLASS T-MODELL,"In 2018, Mercedes-AMG facelifted the C-Class range, and that meant that apart from the sedan, the long-roof version also received a well-deserved update. Even though Mercedes-AMG produced several models that were different from those manufactured by Mercedes-Benz, it still had a few models that were based on regular three-pointed-star vehicles. One example is the C-Class, which was also empowered by AMG in a few versions. One of them was the C43, available as a sedan or as a station wagon, named T-Model. With a precise strategy, Mercedes-AMG introduced an update for the 2014 C 43 four years after the model's introduction. Thus, the front fascia received a twin-louver design with the big three-pointed star badge in the middle. On the lower side of the bumper, the A-shaped lower intake was flanked by two functional air intakes needed to cool the brakes. For the headlights, AMG opted for a unique design, with smoked glass and a single-line LED. The car's profile revealed the same long-roof shape as on the non-facelifted version, with a roof spoiler mounted atop the tailgate. The interior received more carbon-fiber trims on the dashboard, center console, center stack, and door cards. Like any other AMG car, the C43 T-Model featured high-bolstered bucket seats at the front. Since it was a station wagon, it sported a split-folding rear bench that was profiled mostly for two passengers, even though it featured three headrests. AMG installed its already famous 3.0-liter V6, direct fuel-injected powerplant also featured on the 2014 model, but it went through some changes. The most significant was the increased power, which reached 385 hp (390 PS). Like its non-facelifted sibling, the C43 4Matic T-Model sent the torque in all corners via a nine-speed (dual-clutch) automatic transmission.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""C-Class"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""station wagon"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""sporty"", ""modern"", ""elegant"", ""aggressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""twin-louver"", ""big three-pointed star badge""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""smoked glass"", ""single-line LED""],    ""bumper"": [""A-shaped lower intake"", ""functional air intakes""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""long-roof shape""],    ""roof"": [""roof spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual exhaust""]  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG S-Class Cabriolet,"Mercedes-Benz introduced the S63 AMG Cabriolet in 2017 as one of its most expensive vehicles on the market by combining a luxurious interior with a fierce engine. The German premium carmaker gave it all in terms of luxury, performance, and technology in the S63AMG Cabriolet. It was a rewarding car for someone who tried to enjoy the ride, regardless of the destination. Mercedes managed to put together three distinct inspiration areas into one vehicle and then cut its roof to make it even more pleasant on the late-night drive. Since it was based on the S-Class Coupe model, it showed the same distinct front area with the single LED strip for the daytime running light inside the headlights. Its bumper featured a flatter trapezoidal shape at the bottom and two side scoops. From its sides, the sculptured lines on the bodywork formed the cross-section of an airplane wing, stretched all the way to the rear wheels. In the back, a small lip-spoiler enhanced the trunk's lid shape, while four rectangular exhausts peaked through the diffuser. Inside, the car showed a combination of luxurious leather, carbon-fiber trims and two large displays on the dashboard. AMG specifically designed the flat-bottom steering wheel for the S-Class range, and it was thick for someone with a bigger hand. For the seats, Mercedes-Benz gave everything it had in terms of comfort and technology. It was a genuine four-seat vehicle. Under the hood, AMG worked its magic and offered a 612 hp engine. It was paired to a 9-speed automatic transmission and could propel the heavy convertible from zero to 100 kph (0-62 mph) in less than four seconds. Last but not least, it was all-wheel-drive.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""S63 AMG Cabriolet"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""fierce"", ""rewarding"", ""distinct"", ""pleasant""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sleek""],    ""grille"": [""distinct""],    ""hood"": [""flatter""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""single strip""],    ""bumper"": [""trapezoidal"", ""flatter"", ""side scoops""],    ""wheel"": [""rear"", ""sculptured lines""],    ""doors"": [""luxurious""],    ""roof"": [""cut""],    ""diffusor"": [""rectangular"", ""peaked""],    ""spoiler"": [""lip""],    ""exhaust"": [""rectangular""]  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG SL-Class,"While its predecessors were designed by Mercedes-Benz, the 2022 model-year, R231, was developed from the ground up by MB's motorsport division, Mercedes-AMG. After almost seven decades on the market, the SL became one of the best-known products from Mercedes-Benz. But all those times, it was mainly a GT and less of a sports car. The R231 promised to change all that. When AMG designed the car, it started with a blank sheet of paper. The only known attributes were the engine and the gearbox. To save some weight, AMG made the car with a retractable soft-top instead of the metallic one used on the previous generation. In addition, the long wheelbase and short overhangs were needed for better high-speed cornering behavior. A Panamericana grille with vertical slats and the three-pointed-star badge in the middle confirmed the AMG status. In the lower part of the bumper, the carmaker placed e set of air scoops, either for engine or brake-discs cooling. The cockpit was a breathtaking view, with a blend of technology and keen attention to detail. For example, there were four turbine-style vents on the dashboard and a big infotainment screen for the MBUX system. For the driver, Mercedes-AMG installed a TFT display instead of analog dials and showed various information there to make their lives easier. Like other SL generations, the R231 provided room for four occupants, with a set of seats in the back. Those were placed there primarily for tax-income reasons or for small bags or dogs since they couldn't accommodate passengers taller than 1.5 m (4.9 ft). For the drivetrain, AMG planned two versions, both being all-wheel-drive. It is a novelty for the SL range, but it was a better choice since the base model provided 476 hp.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""SL"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""long wheelbase, short overhangs"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""luxurious"", ""aggressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""angled""],    ""grille"": [""Panamericana"", ""vertical slats""],    ""hood"": [""retractable soft-top""],    ""headlights"": [""sleek"", ""modern""],    ""bumper"": [""air scoops""],    ""wheel"": [""large"", ""sporty""],    ""doors"": [""sleek"", ""modern""],    ""roof"": [""retractable soft-top""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""all-wheel-drive""]  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG C-Class Wagon,"While some people still enjoyed their coupes, sedans, and hatchbacks, others needed station wagons for their families but still wanted to have fun at the wheel. For them, Mercedes-AMG made the C43 4Matic T-Model. Not all station wagons are born equal, and the C43 T-Model is proof of that. With its over 400 horses under the hood, technology carried over from Formula 1, and a trunk big enough for a couple of strollers, it could offer pleasure for the driver and enough luggage space for a family of four. The C43 was developed on the same platform as the rest of the C-Class W206, but after a healthy cure at the AMG's beauty saloon, it came out with a different front fascia. It offered a Panamericana grille and an aggressive-looking apron that sported air-intakes on the sides and an additional grille in between to cool the engine and other accessories. Moreover, the carmaker adorned the front fenders with a set of Turbo-electrified badges, boasting their visual upgrades. At the back, the T-Model (station wagon) featured an electric-operated tailgate adorned with a spoiler. Under the rear bumper, the four exhausts set was a promise for performance. Inside, like its sedan sibling, the C43 T-Model featured a pair of bucket seats at the front and a cabin wrapped in ARTICO man-made leather. It also boasted the same dual-screen dashboard, one in front of the driver as an instrument panel and a second touchscreen unit atop the center stack for the MBUX infotainment system. The main difference was in the back, where the split-folding bench extended the trunk area from 490 liters (17.3 cu-ft) up to 1,510 liters (53.3 cu-ft). Under the hood, the 2.0-liter powerplant carried over from the A-class but mounted longitudinally offered 408 PS (402 hp).

Mercedes-AMG EQE,"Mercedes-AMG expanded its product lineup with the introduction of the EQE models in 2022 and offered it either as the 43 4Matic or the 53 4Matic+. Both of them were built on the same electric-architecture EVA2 developed by Mercedes-Benz as a solution for its emission-free vehicles. The EQE came in a smaller package than its bigger brother, the EQS, but with enough performance to lure customers away from ICE-powered vehicles. But it couldn't do that only with silent motors and some fancy screens inside the cockpit; it had to deliver more than that. For starters, the exterior showed the aggressive AMG styling for the front bumper, with the A-shaped lower grille placed into the apron. It was flanked by a pair of air scoops in front of the wheels, needed to cool the brakes. The main grille, between the headlights, was actually a panel with vertical chromed lines that mimicked the panamericana grille. Yet, since it was an electric vehicle, it didn't need that much cooling area. From its sides, the EQE revealed its fastback shape, with a sloped rear window and a lip-spoiler on the liftgate. Its standard 20"" light-alloy wheels, with an option for a 21"" set, completed the image of a sports car, even though it had five doors (including the tailgate). Inside, the carmaker installed a pair of sports bucket seats at the front, with integrated headrests, and divided by a tall center console used as a storage area and for the multimedia controller pad. Like on the EQS, the EQE featured a three-screen dashboard. A large TFT display was in the instrument cluster, while the center stack hosted a touchscreen unit. The third was mounted in front of the right passenger. At the back, Mercedes-AMG installed a bench for three, with enough legroom and no center tunnel since there was no driveshaft to cross the vehicle. For the drivetrain, Mercedes-AMG installed a 90.6 kWh battery pack that provided the energy for the motors installed on both axles.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""EQE"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""smaller package"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""fastback"", ""sporty"", ""electric"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""A-shaped"", ""vertical chromed lines"", ""panamericana style""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""aggressive"", ""A-shaped lower grille""],    ""wheel"": [""20\"" light-alloy"", ""21\"" optional""],    ""doors"": [""five doors""],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""lip-spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG ONE,"Mercedes-AMG evolved from being a subsidiary of Mercedes-Benz into a separate brand focused on high-performance vehicles, and the ONE was a special project that marked the 75th Anniversary of the marque. Based in Affalterbach, Germany, AMG was founded in 1967 as an independent engineering company specializing in performance enhancements of Mercedes-Benz road cars. Over time, it also worked for other automakers, but the three-pointed star brand remained its main focus. Subsequently, in 1999 it became a subsidiary of the big German premium carmaker, and in 2012 it made it onto Formula 1 as Mercedes-AMG. Ten years after, it launched the ONE, a hypercar like no other, which had its underpinnings developed mostly for race tracks, even if it was street-legal. The ONE's look was made under the form follow function principle, and it featured a low nose, with an integrated grille on the bumper flanked by massive side scoops that were fully functional, needed to cool not only the brakes but also some electronic parts and also meant to divert the airflow around the bodywork to improve aerodynamics. On the sloped-down roof, the automaker installed an air intake for the engine mounted in front of the rear axle. Finally, a massive wing at the back ensured the downforce needed on a track. The cabin was revolutionary in terms of design for any other production model Mercedes-Benz ever created. It featured a squarish steering wheel that sported several buttons and LEDs for the shift-lights. Fronting the driver was a rectangular display for the instrument panel, while atop the center stack was a second screen for the infotainment system. Because yes, Mercedes-AMG installed one in the ONE. The two sports seats with integrated headrests were wrapped in Nappa leather and DINAMICA microfiber, while the rest of the cabin abounded in carbon-fiber trims. But the most significant part of the hypercar was on the engineering side, where a 1.6-liter turbocharged engine and a pair of electric motors ensured the high performance of the ONE.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mercedes-AMG ONE"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""hypercar"",  ""overall-design"": [""high-performance"", ""race-inspired"", ""aerodynamic"", ""revolutionary"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""integrated""],    ""hood"": [""low""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""massive"", ""functional""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloped"", ""air-intake""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""massive""],    ""exhaust"": [""turbocharged"", ""high-performance""]  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV,"The electrification program for Mercedes-AMG continued with the introduction of the 2022 EQE SUV, unveiled in October 2022. Since there was an increased demand for high-performance electric SUVs on the market, the German premium automaker felt obliged to create something and give a proper answer to the BMW iX or the Audi e-tron. Thus, the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV provided enough room for a family, and it was quick enough to take on many sports cars. With a front fascia that resembled the well-known Panamericana grille with vertical slats, the new electric SUV from the German automaker was keen to prove that it was worthy. In addition, the lower bumper that incorporated the A-shaped grille and the side scoops was a signature design for the AMG brand. Its profile revealed an elegant silhouette with a raked-forward rear windscreen. Finally, at the back, the LED taillights with a narrow design and a red light strip that crossed the tailgate created an upscale look. Last but not least, the automaker didn't even try to mimic exhausts in the rear apron. Inside, the automaker stated that it used recycled and recyclable materials. Moreover, it used only man-made leather to create a nature-oriented design. The dashboard was similar to the EQE, featuring only displays for the instrument cluster, the infotainment system, and a third touchscreen for the side passenger. Thanks to the flat floor and the lack of a transmission tunnel, the EQE SUV provided plenty of room for five adults. Yet the split-folding bench in the back was profiled for two passengers. The drivetrain was a marvel on its own, with a decoupling front motor system that allowed the vehicle to run on RWD mode only. Thus, the vehicle could travel on longer distances.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""midsize"",  ""overall-design"": [""elegant"", ""upscale"", ""nature-oriented""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked-forward""],    ""grille"": [""Panamericana"", ""vertical slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""lower A-shaped grille"", ""side scoops""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""recycled and recyclable materials""],    ""roof"": [""elegant silhouette""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""no visible exhausts""]  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG EQS,"The EQS53 4Matic + represented a big turning point for the German carmaker since it was the first production electric vehicle that sported the Mercedes-AMG badge. The EV revolution forced the German brand to focus on the next generation of sports sedans, and their first production vehicle in that area was the EQS53 4Matic+. It showed the same shape as the EQS electric luxury sedan from Mercedes-Benz, but with some touches here and there to make it look different. While its exterior look still remained traditional, with a hood and engine compartment in front of the cabin. Its longer roofline resembled the AMG GT 4-door coupe, but it was dictated and formed in the wind tunnel. In fact, AMG claimed that the new car has a 0.20 aerodynamic drag coefficient, which was extremely low. Inside, there were no analog clocks or dials. The carmaker placed a screen in front of the driver, another screen replaced the center stack, and a third one appeared in front of the front passenger. The Alcantara trims from the dashboard, and center console emphasized the car’s sporty character. Since AMG developed it, the front bucket seats provided high bolstered areas to keep their occupants in place during hard cornering. At the back, the profiled-for-two bench and the flat floor ensured enough comfort for the rear passengers. AMG installed an all-wheel-drive system with an engine on each axle, developing a total of 658 hp and a huge amount of torque of 950 Nm (700 lb-ft). With the option for the Performance package, those values increased up to 761 hp and 1,020 Nm (774 lb-ft).",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""EQS53 4Matic +"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""longer roofline"",  ""overall-design"": [""electric luxury sedan"", ""traditional exterior look"", ""sporty character"", ""aerodynamic"", ""high performance""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""traditional"", ""front engine compartment""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""longer roofline""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG S-Class,"It was the longest and the most potent S-Class ever, and it offered a straight-line acceleration that could match a supercar. The 2017 Mercedes-Benz S-Class L was a piece of engineering and architecture alike. It was that kind of limousine that looked great in any luxurious resort, in front of the Opera or the parking lot of a multi-million dollar estate. The AMG S 65L, on the other hand, was made for those who asked for more. Usually, a luxury car didn't have such an aggressive styling at the front. But the S65 L was not an ordinary vehicle. It revealed its muscles through the silver mesh design that covered the grilles from the apron. From its sides, the S65 featured unique, 16 spokes 20"" light-alloy wheels. The longer rear doors allowed an easier ingress and egress to the car for the rear passengers. Maybe they had to crawl out from the fast Merc'. Inside the cabin, at the front, the luxurious vehicle featured the same dashboard as the rest of the range but with AMG-specific vents and ash wood trims. The customers could have chosen a carbon-fiber decoration if they liked to, but that didn't fit the context. There were only two seats separated by a center console in the rear, which emerged from the one placed between the front seats. Under the hood, the massive, twin-turbocharged V-12 powerplant had to be tuned down to 1000 Nm (737 lb-ft) of torque not to ruin the transmission. AMG didn't install the newest 9G-Tronic gearbox for the S65 since it couldn't cope with that much pressure and chose the 7G-Tronic instead. Power went only to the rear wheels, so the car could even drift. AMG programmed the ESP so the driver could do that if the owner from the rear seats wished that.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mercedes-Benz S-Class L"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""longest, potent"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""aggressive"", ""muscular"", ""elegant"", ""powerful""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""silver mesh design""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""16 spokes 20\"" light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [""longer rear doors""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG G 63,"When Mercedes-Benz finally changed the G-Class after almost three decades on the market, it did it in style, and it added an AMG version. The 2018 model G 63 AMG was longer, taller, and most importantly, wider than the former G-Class 63 AMG. It still relied on a body-on-frame construction but with a new chassis and a front, double-wishbone, independent suspension. From the outside, the AMG treatment included the 12-slats Panamericana grille at the front. The standard, round, LED headlights resembled the older G-Class. Its flared wheel-arches widened the vehicle and covered the standard 20"" light-alloy wheels. A set of aluminum side steps made the ingress and egress easier for all passengers, although the side-mounted double exhaust might ruin a dress or a suit. The car sported LED taillights, and a full-size spare wheel mounted on the side-hinged trunk door. Inside, the carmaker created a luxurious interior with metallic buttons on the center stack and a sturdy center console with a large storage compartment. In front of the driver, the carmaker installed two screens under the same glass cover. The center display was for the infotainment MBUX system, while the one in front of the driver was for the instrument panel. A pair of sport bucket seats didn't look very appropriate for an off-road vehicle but provided good side support. Underneath the squared-looking bodywork, AMG installed a 4.0-liter, twin-turbocharged V-8 engine that sent 585 hp to all wheels via a nine-speed automatic gearbox. Thanks to its standard three locking differentials and the low-range gear transfer case, the heavy vehicle was ready for any rough terrain. Also, for higher cornering speeds, the G 63 featured an Airmatic adaptive suspension.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""G-Class"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""longer, taller, wider"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""rugged""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""standard""],    ""grille"": [""12-slats Panamericana""],    ""hood"": [""flared""],    ""headlights"": [""round"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""flared wheel-arches"", ""20\"" light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [""aluminum side steps""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""side-mounted double""]  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG S-Class Coupe,"When the 612 hp provided by the 4.0-liter biturbo S63 AMG was no longer enough, the German carmaker offered the 6.0-liter V-12 biturbo engine and upgraded the badge as well. The horsepower battle was nowhere near its end in 2017 when Mercedes-AMG introduced the S65 Coupe. It might have looked like its less-powered brother, but it was a different kind of animal that could breathe with 50 percent more cylinders and displacement. At least, it kept the same number of turbochargers. From the outside, the big and fast Coupe featured an aggressive grille, inspired by the AMG GT model, with 14 chromed vertical slats. The front apron was divided into three air-intakes: a centrally mounted wide grille and two side pods to cool the brakes. The side sculptured profile on the fenders and doors amplified the car's dynamic profile, which was built on a shortened S-Class platform. In the back, the slim LED taillights took their inspiration from the same AMG GT. Inside, the front sport seats were wide and comfortable, with adjustable side bolsters. The two seats in the back offered enough legroom and headroom for adult passengers. The S65 Coupe was a true 2+2 vehicle. For the instrument panel, AMG S65 Coupe featured a 12.2"" wide-screen color display that reproduced the round dials of a classic instrument cluster. Under the hood, AMG installed a 6.0-liter V-12 helped by a pair of turbochargers. It produced 1000 Nm (738 lbs), which was more than some trucks' engines. Unlike its brother, it could provide 630 hp, which didn't seem too much of an improvement, but its high torque was impressive.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""S65 Coupe"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""big"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""fast"", ""dynamic"", ""wide"", ""comfortable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""aggressive"", ""chromed"", ""vertical""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""slim"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""pair of turbochargers""]  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG A-Class,"Mercedes-Benz introduced the fourth generation of the A-Class in 2018, and AMG introduced a more powerful version for it in 2019. Up to the third generation of the A-Class, Mercedes-Benz was not very happy with the sales results. Moreover, technical issues with either the car's handling or the gearbox issues worsened the situation. When it switched from an MPV-look to a compact hatchback and sedan body version, the sales took-off, and with the AMG versions, it established the image of a premium hot-hatch. But the carmaker offered the same performance package in the sedan version as well. Thanks to its new design, the fourth generation of the A-Class Sedan was more appealing. At the front, it featured CLS-inspired headlights, a wide hexagonal grille adorned by a twin-louver slat, and an AMG-specific bumper. Thus, the car looked more aggressive than its less-powered siblings. From its sides, the big, 18"" light-alloy-wheels filled the wheel-arches. In the rear, a lip-spoiler on the trunk-lid and two oval, chromed exhausts completed the image. Inside, AMG offered an option for sport bucket-seats with integrated headrests, but even the standard ones offered high-bolstering. A tall center console separated the front occupants. In the rear, the passengers had adequate legroom thanks to the car's big wheelbase. AMG removed the classic analog dials from the dashboard and installed two wide screens: one for the instrument panel and the other for the infotainment system. It worth mentioning the turbine-styling for the five vents. Under the hood, AMG worked its magic and turbocharged the inline-four engine. It resulted in a massive 306 hp. While some A-Class versions were front-wheel-drive, the 35 AMG version featured a standard all-wheel-drive system.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""A-Class"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""premium"", ""sporty"", ""compact"", ""appealing""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wide"", ""hexagonal"", ""twin-louver""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""CLS-inspired""],    ""bumper"": [""AMG-specific""],    ""wheel"": [""big"", ""18-inch"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""lip""],    ""exhaust"": [""oval"", ""chromed""]  }}```"
Mercedes-AMG SLC,"The name has been changed from SLK to SLC and so was the AMG engine. In 2016, instead of a 5.5-liter V8, the customers could choose for the SLC 43 twin-turbo V6. The first AMG 43 badge was placed on a 1998 C-Class. Back then, it was a naturally aspirated V8 unit and it was a fine machine. Over time, new emission rules and the need for more power forced the AMG to change the approach. When it came to the market in 1996, the SLK was praised for its metallic retractable roof. The third generation was launched in 2011 with a 2016 facelift when the SLK became SLC. For the AMG version, an ""A-wing"" form dominated the grille which was in high-gloss black. A silver splitter was installed to enhance the dynamic look of the vehicle. Inside, the contoured sports seats gave the driver ideal good support in the sport-bucket seats. The instrument cluster offered all relevant information is arranged on a layout optimized for a dynamic driving style with two tube-shaped round dials and a 4.5” color display. The gear selector was on the center console and the driver could choose to change the gear with paddle shifters. The 3.0 liters engine under the hood was helped by a pair of turbochargers. With a total output of 367 hp, it didn't match the former SLK 55 V8 engine that had 415 hp. Also, the torque was 520 Nm (383 lb-ft), which were slightly less than the 540 Nm (398 lb-ft) of the former V8 unit.",Mercedes-AMG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""SLC"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""dynamic"", ""contoured"", ""sporty"", ""metallic"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""high-gloss black"", ""A-wing form""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""retractable"", ""metallic""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual"", ""sporty""]  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ EQB,"Mercedes-Benz introduced a new electric SUV with seven seats at the 2021 Auto Shanghai, developed and produced in its Chinese factory near Beijing. The German carmaker announced the EQ range in 2016 at the Paris Motor Show, but it took it another three years to start the assembly lines for the 2019 EQC. It was followed by the EQV minivan and the EQA crossover. Mercedes-Benz also announced that the EQ would be developed as a sub-brand focused on electric vehicles. Mercedes-Benz already produced the GLB in the Chinese factory, and since it was built on top of the MFA2 platform used for the GLA, it was just a matter of time until it could offer it as an electric vehicle. But on the outside, it looked very similar to its gasoline-powered SUV. The changes included a masked grille since it wasn't needed to cool the engine and new, EQ-style headlights. Its front fascia had an A-shaped lower bumper with a pair of side-scoops. Its boxy profile confirmed the SUV status, while the extended rear area behind the doors confirmed the seven-seat option. Inside, the carmaker installed a similar-shaped dashboard as in the A-class or EQA. The two screens mounted on the dashboard shared the same glass cover and left the impression of a single unit, but they were different. Mercedes-Benz installed a TFT display in front of the driver and a touch-screen above the center stack. There were three seat rows available, with a tilting and sliding middle row, while the last two seats were folding into the trunk's floor. The drivetrain featured front or all-wheel-drive variants, with a base 200 kW motor for the European customers, while the Chinese version was available with a 215 kW and an AMG-line trim level.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mercedes-Benz EQB"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""electric"", ""boxy"", ""similar to GLB"", ""masked grille"", ""EQ-style headlights""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""masked""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""EQ-style""],    ""bumper"": [""A-shaped"", ""lower"", ""side-scoops""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""extended rear area""],    ""roof"": [""boxy profile""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ GLE-Class,"The German automaker introduced a facelifted version for the GLE lineup at the beginning of 2023, adding more features to its well-known premium SUV, improving the powertrains, and refreshing the car's look. Mercedes-Benz introduced the fourth generation of the GLE (which was known as the ML-Class) in 2018 at the Paris Motor Show and gave it a well-deserved facelift in 2023. Usually, the automaker used to upgrade its models every other four years. But the automaker didn't cut any corners on this refreshed version, improving the car's look, the interior, and the drivetrains. The 2024 GLE featured an improved front fascia that sported high-performance LED headlights with two blocks for the daytime running lights and four for the versions fitted with the multibeam LED technology. Its grille also sported a new double slat. Finally, the GLE featured two blocks on the taillights at the back, divided between the rear quarter panels and the racked-forward tailgate. The interior boasted bolstered front seats and a split-folding bench in the rear, as its predecessor. On the dashboard, though, Mercedes-Benz installed two wide screens behind the same piece of glass, creating the image of a seamless wide display. The driver had its digital instrument panel, while atop the center stack was the touchscreen for the MBAUX infotainment system. New features were also added to the car, including a system that could help the driver when backing up with a trailer attached. Under the hood, the German automaker introduced a new generation of hybrid drivetrains that included an integrated starter generator (ISG), which helped the luxurious GLE get better fuel efficiency.

MERCEDES BENZ GLE-Class Coupe,"Mercedes-Benz refreshed its GLE Coupe lineup in early 2023 and added more functions and features to the well-known premium SUV while boosting the powertrains and improving the vehicle's look. The fourth generation of the GLE (previously known as the ML-Class) was introduced in late 2018 at the Paris Motor Show. However, by 2023 it had already started to show its age not only on its exterior but also on its underpinnings. That's why the German automaker added a facelifted version that drastically improved the car. From the outside, the coupe version featured an improved front fascia with standard high-performance LED and two points for the daytime running lights, and four points for versions fitted with the multibeam LED technology. Its grille also sported a new double slat. Finally, the GLE Coupe featured two horizontal blocks on the taillights at the back, divided between the rear quarter panels and the racked-forward tailgate. Inside, the automaker added new bolstered high-mounted seats for the front occupants and a split-folding bench in the rear. In addition, Mercedes-Benz installed two wide screens on the dashboard covered by a single glass panel.

MERCEDES BENZ GLC Class Coupe,"Almost a year after the introduction of the GLC's second generation, the German automaker launched the coupe version for it in March 2023 as a 2024 model year. The sporty-looking GLC Coupe was no longer a surprise for customers, and they were eager to see it in the flesh after its regular-back sibling, the GLC was unveiled in June 2022. With its dynamic image and fresh look, the coupe version of this compact-sized SUV came on the market boasting advanced technologies and engines for every taste. It could also be optioned with an AMG pack. The 2024 GLC Coupe shared the same design language with its GLC stablemate, featuring similar swept-back headlights with an angular inner side and rounded, raised outer side. In addition, the front fascia wore a broad grille fitted with a mesh and a chromed horizontal slat that supported the center-mounted three-pointed star badge. From its profile, the sloped-down roof and the raked-forward tailgate were the design elements that made it look like a coupe. The car was fitted with a luxurious yet sporty interior, and the carmaker offered high-bolstered seats as an option. For the dashboard, Mercedes-Benz installed a 12.3"" screen for the instrument panel, while atop the center stack, it mounted a second, 11.9"" touch-screen. In addition, a color head-up display was offered as an option. Furthermore, it was fitted with the Mercedes me App that could connect to Android or Apple devices. In the back, the headroom was smaller than on the regular GLC, and the trunk was not spectacular. But these were traded for the car's overall appearance. Under the hood, Mercedes-Benz installed only electrified powerplants, either gasoline or turbo-diesel.

MERCEDES BENZ GLA,"Mercedes-Benz built the GLA on the same platform as the A-Class and the GLB, thus creating a compact-sized crossover for urban environments but still being able to tackle some unpaved roads. Thanks to some input from Renault-Nissan Alliance, the GLA's first generation came on the market in 2013, followed by a second generation six years later, in 2019. But despite having the three-pointed star badge on the grille, it still needed a refresh after four years. Thus, in 2023, the German automaker updated the lineup. With its new standard LED headlights, the updated GLA finally matched the position it deserved in the premium segment. In addition, they flanked the redesigned grille that sported a horizontal slat and the big three-pointed star badge. Moreover, the lower bumper sported a bow-tie-like area, with two side scoops and a slimmer area squeezed between the upper and lower grilles. From its profile, the standard 17"" light alloy wheels offered the car a luxurious yet sporty look. For those looking for something more, the automaker offered options for 18"" and 19"" sets. Finally, at the back, the GLA received a new set of LED taillights with two distinctive blocks: one on the quarter panels and the other on the tailgate. Inside, the five-seat GLA provided enough room for four adults or five on short jaunts. Mercedes-Benz also improved the MBAUX infotainment system, which now sported a standard 7"" screen for the instrument panel and a second 10.25"" for the navigation and the rest of the sound system's features. In addition, a twin set of 10.25"" displays was available as an option. Thus, the driver could have seen the dials easier. Mercedes-Benz also revised the drivetrains and provided the GLA with more electrified versions. Besides those, it also offered the vehicle with a few turbo-diesel engines.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""GLA"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""refreshed"", ""premium""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""redesigned"", ""horizontal slat"", ""big three-pointed star badge""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""standard LED"", ""new""],    ""bumper"": [""lower bow-tie-like area"", ""side scoops"", ""slimmer area""],    ""wheel"": [""17\"" light alloy"", ""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""18\"" option"", ""19\"" option""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""electrified"", ""turbo-diesel""]  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ GLB,"Mercedes-Benz GLB was introduced in 2019 as a luxury compact crossover, and it went through a facelift in 2023. Since customers asked for more features and comfort for crossovers that could cope well with city traffic, the automaker made the GLB. But even if the car sported the three-pointed star badge at the front, it wasn't immune to aging. So, four years after the initial launch, the luxurious compact-segment crossover had gone through a mid-life cycle update. Thanks to its new standard LED headlights, the GLB had a stronger presence on the market. But the automaker pushed things a little further, and from the base version, it fitted the vehicles with 17"" light-alloy wheels, with an option for 18"" or 19"" sets. For those looking for an aggressive-looking vehicle, Mercedes-Benz offered an AMG package that added a different apron fitted with the classic A-shaped lower grille. On the inside, customers were greeted by the double-screen on the dashboard. Fronting the driver was a 7"" display for the instrument panel paired with a 10.25"" screen for the infotainment system. As an option, the former LCD could've been replaced by a 10.25"" unit. Since both displays were covered by the same piece of glass, it looked like they were one unit. To further enhance the tech-oriented crossover, Mercedes-Benz adorned the cabin with aluminum trims. With the 2023 version, the automaker brought more electrified versions of the car. Still, in specific countries, it sold the GLB with a range of three turbo-diesel units that drove either the front or all wheels of the vehicle.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mercedes-Benz GLB"",  ""year"": ""2019, 2023"",  ""size"": ""luxury compact crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""tech-oriented"", ""aggressive-looking""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""A-shaped"", ""classic""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""stronger presence""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""17\"" light-alloy"", ""18\"" or 19\"" available""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [],    ""interior"": [""double-screen dashboard"", ""7\"" instrument panel display"", ""10.25\"" infotainment display"", ""aluminum trims""]  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ EQA,"Mercedes-Benz introduced the EQA in its inventory during the world pandemic situation in 2020, and three years later, it released the refreshed version of it. Usually, the German premium automaker didn't rush things in its office and used to update its models once every four years. But that rule had to be changed for several vehicles, including its smallest-sized crossover vehicle with an electric drivetrain, the EQA. As a result, in 2023, the car manufacturer surprised its fans with the refreshed version of this electron-powered vehicle made for those who wanted to switch to sustainable transportation solutions. While most of the car remained unchanged, there were several areas where a keen eye for detail could notice some differences. After successfully introducing the larger models EQE, EQS, and EQS SUV, the three-pointed star brand noticed that customers liked these vehicles' front ends. As a result, it started to apply it to most of its EVs, including the EQA. For the 2024 model year, this compact-sized crossover sported a black panel adorned with the brand's logo. In addition, the headlights were adorned with LEDs on their upper side, unlike the previous version that sported V-shaped endings for these daytime running lights. Also, above the redesigned front panel, the automaker installed a horizontal LED bar that stretched between headlights. From its profile, the 2024 model year remained virtually unchanged, while at the back, the taillights were refreshed. They sported a horizontal bar on their top instead of rectangular shapes. Inside, the automaker installed an elegant dashboard and offered an option for an illuminated panel in front of the side passenger. The front seats were separated by a tall center console, where Mercedes installed a pair of cup holders and a wireless charging port. Still, due to the short wheelbase, the EQA couldn't provide too much room for the passengers seated in the rear on a split-folding bench seat. But still, it was good enough for short jaunts. The automaker made the EQA a compact yet sporty crossover, and that's why it offered customers several options for seats, including high-bolstered ones for the front passengers. On the options list, Mercedes included a Burmester sound system that could provide an immersive Dolby Atmos sound, which was uncommon for this kind of vehicle. Underneath the skin, the EQA was still powered by electric motors and available with either a front or an all-wheel-drive system. The battery pack could provide a 560 km (348 miles) range on a single charge, by WLTP standards, which was more than enough for such a vehicle. On the safety side, the EQA has received new features and improved functions. For instance, the lane-keeping assist system could correct the car's traveling direction via steering inputs instead of using the ESP system, resulting in more comfortable rides.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""EQA"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""modern"", ""elegant"", ""sporty"", ""sustainable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black panel"", ""brand's logo""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED adorned"", ""horizontal LED bar""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""short wheelbase""],    ""doors"": [""elegant"", ""tall center console""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [],    ""taillights"": [""refreshed"", ""horizontal bar""],    ""interior"": [""illuminated panel"", ""high-bolstered seats"", ""Burmester sound system""],    ""drivetrain"": [""electric motors"", ""front or all-wheel-drive system"", ""560 km range""],    ""safety-features"": [""improved lane-keeping assist""]  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ E-Klasse and predecessors,"Mercedes-Benz introduced the sixth generation of the E-Class (W214) in the spring of 2023, replacing the W213 lineup after seven years. Even though the change towards electromobility was riding the high tides, the German automaker launched the 2024 E-Class based on a platform suitable for internal combustion engines. Even though it provided the vehicle, among other engine options, with plug-in hybrid versions, it wasn't available as a full-electric car. With a design inspired by its bigger sibling, the S-Class, the 2024 E-Class was available right from the start in two major trim lines: AMG and Exclusive. The main grille was adorned with three-pointed star badges for the former, while the latter sported three chromed horizontal slats. The German automaker also added a light contour for the grille, emphasizing the car's luxurious look. All versions boasted LED headlights with an option for an intelligent lighting system. From its profile, the E-Class resembled its bigger brother thanks to its long wheelbase and the cab-rearward design of the greenhouse. As a final touch, at the back, the E-class featured a new design for the taillights that consisted of three-pointed stars shaped lamps. Inside, the automaker took inspiration from the EQE and EQS and installed a digital dashboard in front of the driver, complemented by a super-screen of 14.9” atop the center stack. In addition, the automaker added a third optional display in front of the side passenger. Mercedes-Benz also used different interior trims (carbon-fiber or wood) for the interior, depending on the selected line of equipment: AMG or Exclusive. Thanks to the longer wheelbase than on its predecessor, the W214 provided better legroom in the back, almost as good as on the S-Class. Mercedes-Benz offered the 2024 E-Class with a range of ICE-only or plug-in hybrid versions for the entire range, with either rear or all-wheel drive systems. All versions could've been ordered with the carmaker's nine-speed automatic transmission. The automaker also offered the option for rear-wheel steering and adaptive suspension, although the last feature was unavailable for plug-in hybrid drivetrains.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""E-Class"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""long wheelbase"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""elegant""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""adorned with badges"", ""light contour"", ""three chromed horizontal slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""intelligent lighting system""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""long wheelbase""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""cab-rearward design""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""new design for taillights, three-pointed stars shaped lamps""]  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ GLS-Class,"Four years after unveiling the third generation of its biggest SUV, the GLS, Mercedes-Benz introduced a facelifted version for it, trying to keep this model's sales high. There were not that many options for premium, seven-seat SUVs on the market, and yet the German automaker cared to keep its product up to modern standards. Evolution was part of its philosophy, and after refreshing the GLE and the GLE Coupe, it had to come with an improved version of the GLS. The vehicle was big enough to comfortably fit a family of four plus a couple of friends. In addition, the powerful engines provided were capable of taking this behemoth vehicle fast, even with a trailer attached at the back. The 2024 model year came with a new grille adorned by four louvers galvanized in Silver Shadow and a new bumper that featured a pair of side air intakes on the lower side. In addition, the car's headlights were redesigned and sported a boomerang-shaped daytime running light plus two smaller blocks inside the headlamps. From its profile, the vehicle boasted new light-alloy wheels and a set of side steps, depending on the options. Inside, the carmaker offered the GLS with seven seats fitted as standard in a 2-3-2 configuration. The dashboard featured a wide glass panel that covered both the instrument panel and the MBUX infotainment system, which resembled the one featured on the EQS SUV. The one placed atop the center stack was, as expected, touch-responsive. Under the hood, the GLS received a choice of four gasoline and turbo-diesel engines, all of which were turbocharged.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""GLS"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""big"",  ""overall-design"": [""modern"", ""powerful"", ""evolutionary"", ""premium"", ""spacious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""galvanized"", ""Silver Shadow"", ""new""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""redesigned"", ""boomerang-shaped"", ""sporty""],    ""bumper"": [""new"", ""side air intakes""],    ""wheel"": [""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ CLA Klasse,"Mercedes-Benz introduced an updated version of its small compact four-door coupe CLA in January 2023, and the car featured more upgrades than just a few colors and wheel options. After four years on the market, the CLA clearly deserved an upgrade. So the German automaker finally brought it as a 2024 model year. With this version, Mercedes upgraded the entire range's exterior, interior, and drivetrain. The German carmaker introduced the second generation of the CLA on the market in 2018 as a four-door coupe for the A-Class hatchback. The vehicle made its way into customers' hearts with its sporty shape. However, it was still capable of transporting four adults inside, but by 2022 standards, it was already old. Thus, the facelifted version came with a new 3D grille that sported a horizontal bar. Furthermore, to emphasize the vehicle's sporty character, the lower bumper featured an AMG-inspired A-shaped center grille flanked by two scoops that channeled the air on the side of the car. In addition, the headlights received an LED upgrade and a different pattern. Inside, the CLA came fitted as standard with a pair of 10.25"" displays, one for the instrument panel and the second, touchscreen, for the infotainment system. In addition, high-seatback seats were installed for the front occupants. Unfortunately, like on the non-facelifted version, the rear bench was profiled for two, and the headroom could have been better. Under the hood, Mercedes-Benz offered a choice of turbocharged gasoline engines helped by a new 48 volts starter generator. While that didn't provide too much power (13 hp), it helped smooth the departures. Power went to the front or all wheels, depending on the version.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""CLA"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""upgraded"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""dynamic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""3D"", ""horizontal"", ""sporty""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""upgraded"", ""different pattern""],    ""bumper"": [""AMG-inspired"", ""A-shaped"", ""scoops""],    ""wheel"": [""options""],    ""doors"": [""four-door""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ CLA Shooting Brake,"Along with its four-door coupe sibling, the CLA Shooting Brake was unveiled at the beginning of 2023 for the 2024 model year. The German automaker continued the saga of its CLA Shooting Brake with a well-deserved upgrade that improved the vehicle in all areas. It could've done just some minor aesthetic changes, but instead, it went the whole nine yards. With this bodywork version, Mercedes-Benz found a way to offer a bigger trunk space and a sleek look to the station wagon variant of the CLA. The facelifted version came with a new 3D grille that sported a horizontal bar. Furthermore, to emphasize the vehicle's sporty character, the lower bumper featured an AMG-inspired A-shaped center grille flanked by two scoops that channeled the air on the side of the car. In addition, the headlights received an LED upgrade and a different pattern. Also, the long roof version featured the same raked-forward tailgate. Inside, the CLA came fitted as standard with a pair of 10.25"" displays, one for the instrument panel and the second, touchscreen, for the infotainment system. In addition, high-seatback seats were installed for the front occupants. Thanks to the long roof, the rear passengers enjoyed better headroom than in the CLA four-door coupe version.

MERCEDES BENZ GLS Maybach,"The German automaker decided to use the Maybach name for its most luxurious vehicles, making such a version for the facelifted GLS lineup in the Spring of 2023. After the dismissal of the Maybach as a brand, Mercedes-Benz tried to keep it alive on its vehicles. Thus, apart from the S-Class, it used it on the GLS, which was its most luxurious SUV. While it wasn't a competitor for a Rolls-Royce Cullinan, it was certainly a vehicle that could threaten a Bentley Bentayga, at least in term of comfort and features. And, while the rest of the GLS range was fitted as standard in a seven-seat configuration, this exclusive model was only fitted with four. But that wasn't the only difference. Boasting a new front fascia with a bigger grille, the GLS 600 Maybach tried to raise the luxury bar to a new level. Thus, besides the two-tone bodywork offered as an option, it also featured exclusive 21"" light-alloy wheels. As an option, customers could opt for a set of 21"" ones. Like the rest of the GLS range, the 600 Maybach also featured a new set of 3D taillights at the back. Still, its rear bumper was different than the rest of the range and sported a pair of flat exhaust tips mounted on the sides while the entire apron was chromed. But where the GLS 600 excelled was on its interior. The leather-wrapped cabin featured four comfortable seats. Those placed in the back were also reclining and separated by a tall center console extended all the way to the dashboard. In addition, those seated in the back could enjoy not two but three touchscreens. Two were mounted in front of them on the front seats' seatbacks, and one between them. It was all about these occupants' comfort on long travels. Just like the rest of its stablemates, the GLS 600 Maybach featured a twin-turbo V8 engine tuned to produce 550 PS (542 hp) paired with the same nine-speed automatic transmission that sent power in all corners.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""GLS 600 Maybach"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""luxurious SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""exclusive"", ""two-tone"", ""chromed"", ""comfortable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""bigger""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""3D""],    ""bumper"": [""different"", ""chromed"", ""flat exhaust tips""],    ""wheel"": [""exclusive 21\"" light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""pair of flat""]  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ E-Class T-Modell All-Terrain,"Representing the seventh generation from a line of dynamic and spacious vehicles, the 2024 E-Class Estate continues the tradition of delivering captivating experiences. With a legacy tracing back to 1977, the Mercedes-Benz E-Class Estate models have consistently been a representative member of the upper mid-range and luxury segments of station wagons. To provide a choice suitable for every customer, the 2024 model can be equipped with a diesel or a gasoline engine, both being mild hybrid engines. There is also a plug-in hybrid version that offers an all-electric range of up to 62 miles (100 km). Handling is also improved to provide a better driving experience. Included as a standard feature, the mild hybrid models come equipped with AGILITY CONTROL steel spring suspension, which incorporates a selective damping system and an air-sprung rear axle. The new E-Class offers the option of all-around AIRMATIC air suspension with continuously adjustable damping, known as ADS+. The AIRMATIC system provides constant ground clearance of the car, no matter what load the car transports. The Mercedes is available in three lines: Avantgarde, Exclusive, and AMG Line, tailored to provide each customer with the level of comfort and quality that suits his needs the best. Unlike the previous version, the roofline is designed more dynamically to provide the model with a more aerodynamic body. The front of the car is marked by a black surface connecting the radiator grille with the headlights. This element offers a look similar to the Mercedes EQ model. An optional illuminated chrome-framed radiator grille can be paired with the standard LED High Performance headlights. Optionally, the headlights can also have a DIGITAL LIGHT technology for increased visibility. Compared to the previous model, the E-Class suffered an increase in width and also has a lengthened wheelbase. These modifications are made to increase the passenger's comfort and also provide more ample cargo space. Even though the interior's upholstery and seat cushioning are made from recycled and renewable materials, the vehicle is also fully technologized and has a digitalized cockpit. The Mercedes can be equipped with an optional front passenger screen. The center console screen combined with the MBUX Superscreen forms a seamless glass surface with a futuristic look. The display is well-connected to the rest of the dashboard through an Active Ambient Lighting system that creates an illuminated strip between the two elements. The Active Ambient Lighting adds another dimension to the qualitative sound from the optional Burmester 4D sound system through the Sound Visualization feature. The lights assist the music through rapid flicks or soft intermissions. The 2024 Mercedes E-Class Estate combines increased practicality with one of the most premium experiences available on the market to what can be viewed by some people as the supreme station wagon.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""E-Class Estate"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""dynamic and spacious"",  ""overall-design"": [""captivating"", ""aerodynamic"", ""premium"", ""technologized"", ""futuristic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""grille"": [""black"", ""illuminated"", ""chrome-framed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""High Performance"", ""DIGITAL LIGHT""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""increased width"", ""lengthened wheelbase""],    ""doors"": [""practical"", ""premium""],    ""roof"": [""dynamic"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ B-Klasse,"Mercedes-Benz facelifted the third generation of the B-Class in 2022 and managed to keep its smallest minivan alive, even though it wasn't the most important segment of the market. After Renault was highly successful with its Espace, and then with all the other minivans it built, other carmakers followed... and most of them failed. Mercedes-Benz tried that recipe, too, with the first generation of the A-Class in 1997, but eventually, that lineup morphed into a regular hatchback, and its place was taken by the B-Class, which was built on the same platform. The third generation of the B-Class was launched in 2019, and due to the world pandemic and microchip shortages, it couldn't sell in high numbers. Yet, the automaker followed its plan and gave the car an enhanced version in 2022. On the outside, the most striking difference was on the headlights, especially on cars fitted with the optional LED ones. Other than that, there were hard to notice any differences. Inside, the game of ""spot the difference"" continued. The B-Class featured the same air vents, and only as an option, the flat-bottom steering wheel that shouldn't be placed into a minivan in the first place. Yet, the screens used for the instrument panel and the infotainment system were larger and offered a crispier image than before, thanks to the enhanced MBAUX system. But the most important upgrade was on the tech side, where the automaker upgraded the plug-in hybrid version for the B-Class. It featured a 15.6 kWh battery pack that could have been recharged at DC fast charging stations. In addition, the electric motor gained 5kW in power than on its predecessor, reaching 80 kW (107 hp).",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""B-Class"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""small minivan"",  ""overall-design"": [""enhanced"", ""striking"", ""crisp"", ""upgraded"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""enhanced"", ""optional LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ GLC Class,"When BMW introduced the X3 in 2003, Mercedes-Benz didn't have anything to fight against it in the compact luxury crossover segment, but its answer came five years later when it unveiled the GLK. In 2015, the three-pointed-star brand decided to change the naming system of its entire SUV stable. Thus, the GLK's successor received the GLC name when it appeared on the market. Fast forward to 2022, and the third generation of Mercedes-Benz's luxury crossover made its debut in the summer of 2022. It was built on top of the same MRA platform as the C-Class with independent suspension in all corners. The 2022 GLC shared the same design language with the C-Class, featuring similar swept-back headlights with an angular inner side and rounded, raised outer side. In addition, the front fascia wore a broad grille fitted with a mesh and a chromed horizontal slat that supported the center-mounted three-pointed-star badge. From its profile, the crossover sported an ascending beltline ended to the raked-forward D-pillars, while the B- and C- posts were blacked-out. The car was fitted with a luxurious yet sporty interior, and the carmaker offered high-bolstered seats as an option. For the dashboard, Mercedes-Benz installed a 12.3"" screen for the instrument panel, while atop the center stack, it mounted a second, 11.9"" touch-screen. In addition, a color head-up display was offered as an option. Furthermore, it was fitted with the Mercedes me App that could connect to Android or Apple devices. Moreover, the integrated OTA update systems allowed streaming via the ""Online Music"" service. For the drivetrain, the 2022 GLC featured only electrified powertrains with an integrated starter-generator (ISG) on a 48-volt architecture. The car came fitted exclusively with a nine-speed automatic gearbox that ensured smooth gear changes regardless of the engine version.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""GLC"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""compact luxury crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""swept-back"", ""angular"", ""rounded""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""swept-back""],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back"", ""angular"", ""rounded""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""luxurious"", ""sporty""],    ""roof"": [""raked-forward""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ A-Klasse,"Mercedes-Benz introduced a final facelift for the A-Class' third generation (W177) in the fall of 2022, trying to give its compact-sized lineup a push before the model's change. In this case, the German automaker didn't look like it tried too hard to show the upgrades since it wasn't such an important makeover, at least from the exterior's design point of view. Considered a compact-sized vehicle in Europe and subcompact in the U.S., the A-Class journey started in 1997 as a minivan. After two generations, Mercedes-Benz finally made a major change and transformed it into a regular hatchback. Later on, it also added a few other bodywork versions for it. For the 2022 model-year, the A-Class hatchback featured a hood with two power bulges and a grille with a star pattern, and flat headlights (which are available with LEDs). At the same time, at the back, the automaker added a new diffuser and standard LED taillights for the entire range. Inside, customers could see the differences even more. The upgraded MBUX infotainment system with fingerprint recognition and new carbon fiber trims distinguished the facelifted version from its predecessor. In addition, the automaker dismissed the rotary knob from the center console since there wasn't needed anymore. The standard 7"" touchscreen could have been upgraded to two choices of 10.25"" units. A new flat-bottom steering wheel was on the options list and completed the luxurious yet sporty image of the car. The seats were made from 100% recycled materials, and the rear bench featured a split-folding capability to increase the trunk's volume. Under the hood, the automaker improved the engine lineup with electrified, 48-Volt architecture and mild-hybrid technology. One of the key features included in the entire range was the new belt-driven starter-generator (RSG).

MERCEDES BENZ C-Klasse T-Modell,"Mercedes-Benz introduced both body versions for the fifth generation of its C-Class range in 2021, and the station-wagon looked more dynamic than before. The premium German carmaker had a long history with station wagons, and it didn't want to drove them away from the assembly line as long as the customers respected it. It didn't have to. All it had to do was to improve them continuously along with the rest of the range. While its predecessors looked more like family wagons, the 2021 model took a different, sportier approach. Thanks to its long front end, the C-Class looked sportier than before. That change appeared for the first time on the fourth generation, W205/S205. Then, Mercedes-Benz decided to continue the trend and adopted the same idea on the W206/S206 lineup. Its arched, third side window looked closer to those used for on the CLA shooting-brake. As usual, the T-model shared most of its parts with its sedan sibling. The carmaker installed the same dashboard with free-standing LCD screens. Customers have a choice between a 10.25"" or a 12.3"" version. On the center stack, Mercedes-Benz installed another big display tilted toward the driver for the infotainment system, with a standard 9.5"" touch-screen and an option for an 11.9"". Its trunk area was increased compared to its predecessor and reached 490 liters (17.3 cu-ft), which could have been extended up to 1510 liters (53.3 cu-ft) by completely folding down the 40/20/40 rear bench. Under the hood, the C-Class S206 started its journey with a new engine lineup. Its downsizing process, combined with the electrification program, led to higher fuel-efficiencies for the entire lineup. At the new generation's start, the car received only automatic transmissions.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""C-Class"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""mid-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""dynamic"", ""sporty"", ""premium""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""long""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""long""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""free-standing LCD screens""],    ""roof"": [""arched"", ""shooting-brake""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""electrification program""]  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ CLS-Klasse,"Mercedes-Benz unveiled the facelifted version of its four-door coupe CLS in 2021 and brought new options and improved features. After 450,000 units sold globally since the first generation's launch, the CLS proved to be a fair bet for the three-pointed-star brand. Even though it didn't offer enough headroom for the rear passengers or large trunks, the CLS was in high demand. The 2021 CLS featured a redesigned front fascia with an AMG-style front bumper fitted as standard. It sported a black A-shaped wing, a front splitter in silver chrome, and a 3D radiator grille. From its sides, the AMG side sills. In the back, the carmaker left everything unchanged, with the same diffuser between the rhomboidal-shaped exhausts. Inside, the carmaker's most significant change was the infotainment system, which came with two 12.3"" screens fitted as standard. They shared the same glass-covered area that made them looked like a widescreen. A touch-pad replaced the older controller between the front seats. Mercedes-Benz introduced automatic parking and exiting parking feature, which warned the driver and applied brakes in cross-traffic situations. Like its predecessor, the 2021 model was not a champ for the interior space, especially for those seated in the rear. With its 12 cu-ft (340 liters) trunk, it could barely compete with some compact hatchbacks, but the CLS owners didn't bother about that. Under the hood, Mercedes-Benz offered a wide choice of diesel, gasoline, and hybrid engines. The base levels introduced two inline-four turbocharged powerplants that sent the power to the rear wheels only. The range-topper was the three-liter inline-six helped by an electric starter-booster that sent 367 hp in all corners. A nine-speed automatic gearbox was standard for the entire range.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""CLS"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""four-door coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""sporty"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""3D"", ""radiator""],    ""hood"": [""redesigned""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""AMG-style"", ""front""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""rhomboidal-shaped""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""diffuser"", ""rhomboidal-shaped""]  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ C-Klasse and predecessors,"In 2021, Mercedes-Benz introduced the fifth-generation for one of its best-selling ranges, the C-Class, and pushed forward the company's electrification process. While the world was still fighting against the pandemic situation, Mercedes-Benz had to push forward toward a cleaner future. Its new range was developed from the ground up and introduced advanced technologies such as rear-axle steering and, as a first for the C-Class, plug-in hybrid versions. With its cab-rearward design proportion, the C-Class featured a longer front end when compared to its overall length. The A-pillars were sloped even more when compared to its predecessor, and the decklid was even shorter. Combined with the power-domes on the hood and the tear-shaped headlights, all these created a sportier appearance for the mid-size sedan. In the back, the LED taillights followed an aggressive design with sharp sides on the inboard section, which crossed from the quarter panels to the trunk lid. Inside, the C-Class designers took their inspiration from the S-Class. They created a dashboard divided into an upper and lower section. There were new, flattened round vents reminiscent of aircraft engines. The driver area featured a high-resolution, free-standing LCD screen. Customers have a choice between a 10.25"" or a 12.3"" version. On the center stack, Mercedes-Benz installed another big display tilted toward the driver for the infotainment system, with a standard 9.5"" touch-screen and an option for an 11.9"".

MERCEDES BENZ S-Klasse and predecessors,"The S-Class was one of the premium vehicles that made the customers come again and ask for the new model. It was like an iPhone in the car industry. Nine out of ten customers bought the S-Class in the long-wheelbase version. Around 80% of the Western European customers and 70% from the U.S. owners returned for the new version. That loyalty rate was a satisfaction proof hard to get by many other brands. The 2020 model was not as much about the outside as it was for the comfort and safety features. Still, Mercedes-Benz couldn't let a facelifted model without exterior changes. The new headlights and the front bumpers were slightly improved over the non-facelifted version. The interior was the one that gets more attention. The virtual reality came on-board in HUD, which virtually draws lines on the tarmac to follow the sat-nav directions. The MBUX (Mercedes-Benz User Experience) infotainment unit featured up to five screens with OLED technology. The voice commands didn't require the ""Hey Mercedes"" to activate it for all the functions. For instance, to answer the phone, the driver just had to say, ""Answer."" A major improvement was the rear-axle steering, which reduced the turning circle by 6.2 feet (1.88 m) in diameter. The new 48v architecture allowed the car to be fitted with mild-hybrid technologies for most of the engines, including a V8 with an integrated starter-generator. The base version was powered by an inline-six turbocharged engine with direct fuel injection that provided 362 hp sent to the rear of the all-four wheels via a 9-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""S-Class"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""long-wheelbase"",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""comfortable"", ""safety-focused"", ""facelifted"", ""sophisticated""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""improved"", ""modern""],    ""bumper"": [""front""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ E-Klasse Cabriolet and predecessors,"When the E-Class coupe lost its head and placed a canvas-top, it became an E-Class convertible, one of the sexiest cars in the executive-car category. Ever since 1953, before even the E-Class had that name, the luxurious Mercedes-Benz range was well received by the market. Each time a new generation was introduced, it was a benchmark for its class. The first generation to receive the E-Class badge was the facelifted, 1993, W124 model. The 2020 model was the facelifted version for the fifth generation, which stormed the showrooms in 2017. Mercedes-Benz introduced the facelift in 2020 with a new set of LED headlights and flatter housings. The diamond-style, 3D design of the grille was enhanced, and the A-shaped lower grille design of the apron amplified the dynamic style. Two powerdomes on the hood evoked a V engine, even if some models received inline-four units. The new LED taillights design and the chromed splitter made the car looks sportier. The canvas-top remained unchanged. The interior received a new technological update for the infotainment unit with the MBUX system. It was fitted with two 10.25"" screens arranged side by side under the same glass-panel. There was an even bigger, 2x12.3"" screen option. The new steering wheel with capacitive touch-areas to control various systems installed on the car enhanced the driving experience. To lower the emissions, the four-cylinder engine received an integrated starter-generator (ISG) and a 48v architecture. A recuperation function and the ability to ""glide"" with the engine switched off made the engine even more efficient. The electrification continued on all the gasoline engines as well, and the only gearbox available for the entire range was the 9G-Tronic (dual-clutch) automatic.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""E-Class"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""executive-car"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""dynamic"", ""sporty"", ""technological"", ""efficient""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""diamond-style"", ""3D"", ""enhanced""],    ""hood"": [""powerdomes"", ""V-shaped""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""flatter housings""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ S-Class Maybach,"More than a century after Wilhelm and Karl Maybach started their journey into the automotive segment, the brand produced its first plug-in hybrid vehicle, the Mercedes-Maybach S 580 e. Based on the same platform as the well-known Mercedes-Benz S Class 580 e, the Maybach version came as a statement for future electrification. Thus, customers who wished to use the vehicle in pure electric mode for their urban businesses were finally able to do that. And, as expected, the car came fitted with all the luxurious features they could hope for. At first sight, the Mercedes-Maybach S 580 e was not too much different from its non-electrified siblings. But a keen eye for detail could notice the blue shades on the headlights. Also, the massive grille with its 27 vertical chromed slats hosted a similar color for the radar. Another detail that differentiated this model from the rest of its stablemates was the charging-port flap on the right-rear quarter panel. Inside, the automaker installed all the luxurious items it had in its storage. The leather-wrapped cabin welcomed occupants with comfortable individual seats at the back, separated by a center console extended all the way to the dashboard. For the driver and side passenger, Maybach installed luxurious heated and cooled seats, fronting a high-tech dashboard. The carmaker placed a 12.8” OLED display atop the center stack, while the driver enjoyed a 12.3” 3D display for the instrument panel. But the most essential upgrade for the car was under its skin. The plug-in hybrid system consisted of a three-liter inline-six gasoline engine that produced 367 PS (362 hp) and an electric motor for a total output of 510 PS (503 hp). The carmaker claimed that the battery pack could provide up to 100 km (62 miles) of pure electric drive, and the car could be charged from either an 11 kW wallbox or, as an option, from a 60 kW DC charger.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mercedes-Maybach S 580 e"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""high-tech"", ""electric"", ""sophisticated""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""chromed"", ""27 vertical slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""blue shades""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ V-Class and predecessors,"In 2014, Mercedes-Benz launched its new generation of V-Class. Now the vehicle is further away from the utility vehicles from which it was based on. More luxury and more comfort were added so now it is more like a limousine with a higher stance. For the 2020 model year, Mercedes-Benz announced important upgrades for its MPV, starting with the exterior look and continuing with the powertrains and transmission. On the grille, in the middle, the three-star logo is bigger and flanked by two silver slats. There will also be three trim levels: Avantgarde, Exclusive and AMG. The latter one has a different front grille with chrome pins, which accentuates the sporty look of the vehicle. Newly designed 18” wheels are offered, with silver and black lines in the middle of the 5-twin spoke design. The top versions may even receive 19” 10 spoke alloy-wheels with a high-sheen finish. For the engines, Mercedes-Benz installed the new OM654 diesel unit with single or bi-turbo. While the single-turbo OM654 offers 190 hp and 440 Nm (324.5 lb-ft)  of torque, while the bi-turbo has 239 hp and 500 Nm (368.8 lb-ft) of torque. The interior received seats at the same level as the flagship S-Class, with full reclining, massage and ventilation systems, which will make any trip a relaxing experience.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""V-Class"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""MPV"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxury"", ""comfort"", ""limousine-like"", ""sporty"", ""elegant""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""bigger"", ""silver slats"", ""chrome pins""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""18” newly designed"", ""silver and black lines"", ""5-twin spoke design"", ""19” 10 spoke alloy-wheels""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ Pullman,"The Pullman version of any Mercedes-Benz was the exclusive version for the top of the range model offered by the German car-maker. But when the Maybach name was added, it meant even more. The Maybach was a German brand that used to build engines for the Zeppelin airships and between the two World Wars, it built very exclusive cars with custom bodyworks. Mercedes-Benz tried to revive the name in 2002 with the Maybach 57 and Maybach 62 models, but that didn't work. In 2018, Mercedes-Benz came up with the idea of introducing the Maybach name as a trim level. It was the top model range for the S-Class. By combining the Maybach with the Pullman, the result was an even more exclusive car: the Mercedes-Benz S650 Pullman Maybach. With one meter (39.4”) added to the wheelbase, the car was the longest Mercedes-Benz S-Class on the market. The rear doors were considerably larger than the regular, or even the long-wheelbase, model. The V12 badges on the front fenders resembled the V12 engine built by Maybach for the Zeppelin airships. Inside, the driver got the same dashboard as in an S-Class Maybach, with two wide screens and leather upholstery on the panel. Between the driver and the rear passengers, there was a privacy panel, which could have been risen or lowered by the rear seat occupants. The rear seats were designed as in a Business Class airplane. The reclining individual seats, with a champagne fridge between them, TV and LCD on the front folding seats, and all the privacy curtains on all windows. To move the 6.5-meter (256”) long vehicle, the Mercedes-Benz S650 Maybach Pullman featured a 6.0-liter bi-turbo engine that offered 630 hp and 1000 Nm (737.5 lb-ft) of torque mated to a standard 7-speed automatic transmission.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mercedes-Benz S650 Maybach Pullman"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""6.5-meter long"",  ""overall-design"": [""exclusive"", ""luxurious"", ""long-wheelbase"", ""V12-powered"", ""business-class""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""larger rear doors""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""bi-turbo""]  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ G-Klasse,"The 2018 Mercedes-Benz G-Class was not a new generation for the famous off-road vehicle. It was a completely new book that changed the whole concept of the vehicle. For almost four decades, the Mercedes-Benz G-Class (or G-Wagon) was the same rugged vehicle, with a ladder-chassis and solid axles front and rear. Over the years, some of its characteristics were improved. The basic, cloth, the interior was changed to exclusive leather. The 4-speed manual was upgraded up to a 7-speed automatic with dual-clutch and the four-banger with a carburetor was replaced to state-of-the-art V8 with direct injection and twin-turbo. But the ladder-chassis was the same. The solid axles were still in place and the three lockable differentials were installed as well. In January 2018 the new G-Class was shown at the North-American International Auto Show in Detroit. The new G-Class was 121 mm (4.8"") wider, 53 mm (2"") longer and 39 mm (1.5"") taller. The increase in the ground clearance was a mere 6 mm (0.23""). But there was a new ladder-type frame and a double-wishbone suspension on the front. The rear axle was kept, but with a different type of connection to the chassis. The three lockable differentials were kept and the low-gear transfer box as well. And so, the 2018 G-Class succeeded to bring more comfort and still the same off-road abilities as the older version. At the time of launch, there were three engines available: two gasoline units and a brand new inline-six turbodiesel. These were mated to a 9-speed Speedhift MCT transmission.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mercedes-Benz G-Class"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""Wider, Longer, Taller"",  ""overall-design"": [""Rugged"", ""Exclusive"", ""State-of-the-art"", ""Comfortable"", ""Off-road""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""Same""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""Exclusive"", ""Leather""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ S-Class Cabriolet,"Even though the German automaker introduced the open-top version of the S-Class, the A217, on the market in late 2015, in 2017, it already brought the facelifted version for it. That happened because the rest of the S-Class range, including the coupe, went through an upgrade, and the convertible couldn't be left aside. So, even if the car didn't look outdated at all, its modifications made the customers happier. On the outside, the 2017 model-year received a new, floating grille that gave the impression of a stellar race. Something like a warp-speed emphasized by the 3D dotted pattern that stood behind the three-pointed star badge and its wings. In addition, the bumper received an A-shaped lower grille, similar to those usually offered on AMG models. Moreover, the headlights were also improved and sported crystals inside that offered a more luxurious flair to this land yacht. At the back, the taillights featured standard OLED lighting. The interior featured a slightly different dashboard design, with the upper side sloped instead of abruptly dropped after the center display, which was installed above the center stack. The infotainment and instrument panel screens were 12.3"" in size and protected by the same piece of glass. In addition, the steering wheel was new and featured a wider gap inside the lower spoke than on the 2016 model-year vehicle. Like its predecessor, the 2017 model-year offered the possibility to open or cover the cabin at speeds of up to 60 kph (37 mph), and the entire process took just 20 seconds. Under the hood, the automaker installed a 4.0-liter V8 mill that replaced the older 4.7-liter unit.

MERCEDES BENZ CLS Shooting Brake,"The 2014 Mercedes-Benz CLS Shooting Brake received a well-deserved facelift with some influences from its big brother, the S-Class. As any facelift that wants to play big, the refreshed model has a new frontal fascia, with improved bumper aerodynamics, LED headlights, new taillights, and a few other small external details. But the new Mercedes-Benz CLS Shooting Brake brought more technical innovations. Since it had to comply with the new Euro 6 standards and had to bring more fuel-efficient engines, Mercedes-Benz installed a couple of four-cylinder turbodiesel engines in the CLS. The 2014 model was available with the 2.1-liter diesel unit in two power versions: a 170 hp with a single turbo for the 220 BlueTec version and 204 hp two-stage turbo for the 250 BlueTec, respectively. Also, a new gasoline engine was introduced: a 3.5-liter V6 biturbo with 333 hp, named the CLS 400. The latter two are also available with all-wheel-drive. The 9G-Tronic transmission is also new for CLS Shooting Brake, replacing the older 7 G-Tronic. The COMMAND Online infotainment system is available as an option with an 8” display. As an option, the CLS Shooting Brake may be ordered with a Garmin MAP PILOT navigation system with the representation of streets and buildings and augmented reality for junctions and lane assistants. The new system also comes with a new Mercedes-Benz online support named “Mercedes connect me” with assistance for an emergency call, accidents, maintenance and breakdown management.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mercedes-Benz CLS Shooting Brake"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""facelift"", ""aerodynamic"", ""refreshed"", ""technical"", ""fuel-efficient""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""improved""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""improved""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ SL AMG,"After five years on the market, the SL received a well-deserved facelift for the entire range, and that included both AMG versions, the SL63, and the SL65. The SL started as a premium roadster for the German carmaker, but later on, it received more powerful engines and special treatments from the AMG department. For the car's fifth generation, introduced in 2011, the motorsports specialists developed new or improved drivetrains and braking systems. But they were constrained to the older five-speed gearboxes, which could withstand up to 1000 Nm (737 lb-ft) of torque. Further developments on the AMG Speedshift MCT 7 allowed the dual-clutch transmission to cope with the same twisting force, while the rest of the range was fitted with the newer 9-speed automatic. For the SL63 version, the German carmaker introduced a new grille that sported a double horizontal slat, supporting the big three-pointed-star badge in the middle. The apron received an updated design with wider air-inlets on the sides that sported black trims on their upper sides. A lip-spoiler under the apron guided the airflow inside the engine bay to help cool it and also reduced the ground-effect that could trouble the car at higher speeds. At the back, a small lip-spoiler adorned the trunk lid, while on the lower side, a double twin-exhaust with silver trims confirmed the car's high-performance designation. Like its SL65 AMG sibling, the SL63 featured a luxurious interior with high-bolstered seats covered in Alcantara. The Air-scarf system that blew warm air to the occupants' necks was standard, while the driver was spoiled with a flat-bottom, three-spoke steering wheel covered in the same expensive material. Under the hood, the hand-built 5.5-liter Biturbo V8 provided enough power and torque to rocket the car from 0 to 62 mph (0-100 kph) in a mere 4.1 seconds.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""SL"",  ""year"": ""2011"",  ""size"": ""premium roadster"",  ""overall-design"": [""powerful"", ""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""aerodynamic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""double horizontal slat""],    ""hood"": [""updated design""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""wider air-inlets"", ""lip-spoiler""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""lip-spoiler"", ""luxurious""],    ""exhaust"": [""double twin-exhaust""]  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ E-Klasse Coupe and predecessors,"Mercedes-Benz continued the tradition of building personal luxury coupes for the mid-size segment. After various other famous vehicles such as the W123 Coupe, the CE (W124), or the two generations of the CLK (C208 and C209), it introduced a new model in 2017, the E-Coupe C238 model. Technically speaking, not all E-Class coupes models were based on the same platform as their sedan siblings that sported similar nameplates but without the coupe addition. The C208, C209, or C207 (in that order) shared their underpinnings with their smaller siblings, the C-Class W202, W203, and W204, respectively. But the 2017 model shared its parts with the proper E-Class, internally named W213. Despite looking like an E-Class from the front, it didn't share its body panels or parts. Its black grille with the three-pointed star badge in the middle was different. Also, the lower apron was available in two options. With the AMG package included, the side-scoops that fed fresh air to the front brakes were connected via a narrow horizontal gap in the bumper, while the regular, non-AMG didn't. Just like its predecessor, the 2017 E-Class coupe featured a raked windshield that was continued, as an option, with a panoramic glass roof. The long, sloped rear windscreen was followed by a short deck for the trunk. Inside, Mercedes-Benz installed bucket seats at the front designed for comfortable long rides, while a pair of sport seats with high-bolstered areas was on the options list. At the back, the E-Coupe offered a bench profiled for two occupants, separated by an area that featured two cupholders. Under the hood, the carmaker installed a wide choice of engines.

MERCEDES BENZ SL-Klasse,"The SL offered the unique choice of a luxurious personal roadster with a retractable hardtop in the Mercedes-Benz lineup, and the 2016 model was no exception. Mercedes-Benz brought the facelifted version of the SL just in time to spend the 2016 summer under the blue sky with a new model year. Its retractable hard-top was one of the features that made it a best-seller in the GT class. Its redesigned front fascia sported a 3D design on the grille and kept the horizontal slat that supported the three-star badge. With its new LED headlights and intelligent lighting system, the 2016 SL offered more confidence during night driving situations. The aerodynamically profiled front bumper featured two side-scoops to cool the disc brakes and a centered, trapezoidal-shaped grille at the bottom. On the hood, the designers made two power-domes evoking the car's sporty character. In the back, Mercedes-Benz added further modifications to the completely red taillights, unlike the 2012 model that featured a clear upper section. Finally, the triangular, flat exhausts replaced the rectangular ones and flanked the new splitter installed under the bumper. The dashboard featured a binocular-style design for the instrument cluster, with the tachometer and speedometer combining the classic analog look with modern technologies. There was a new sporty design for the dials and needles. A TFT multi-function display found its place in the middle, between the circular instruments. Under the hood, the 2016 SL offered a choice of two engines: the upgraded 3.0-liter V-6 for the base version and a 4.7-liter V-8. Both turbocharged engines provided more power to the new 9G-Tronic (dual-clutch) gearbox. Mercedes-Benz enhanced the Active Body Control system for higher cornering speeds and more comfortable rides as well.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""SL"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""luxurious personal roadster"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""aerodynamic"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""3D design"", ""horizontal slat"", ""trapezoidal-shaped""],    ""hood"": [""power-domes"", ""sporty""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""intelligent lighting system""],    ""bumper"": [""aerodynamically profiled"", ""side-scoops"", ""centered grille""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""retractable hard-top""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""triangular"", ""flat""]  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ CLS AMG,"Mercedes-Benz introduced the refreshed version of the second generation CLS model in 2014, and along with the rest of the range, the most powerful version of it, the 63 AMG, has gone through an update as well. When the German automaker introduced the second generation of this four-door coupe on the market in 2009, it was an important step forward, although the car came during the world financial crisis, and that affected the brand's sales. Still, by 2014, those numbers climbed back. Also, in 2014, the European Union started to switch from Euro 5 emission standards to Euro 6. As a result, not just Mercedes-Benz but all automakers had to upgrade their vehicles. The CLS 63 AMG couldn't make an exception, and the automaker used the moment to implement several other improvements to this four-door coupe. The most striking change was noticed at the front, where the AMG received a diamond-pattern grille, which replaced the simple black one used on its predecessor. Mercedes-Benz also upgraded the headlights with the Multibeam LED technology and made them better for night driving situations. Furthermore, the automaker also changed the front bumper, which incorporated the A-shaped lower grille and the massive side scoops covered with a chicken-wire style mesh. From its profile, the 2014 Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG featured the same V8 biturbo chromed badges on the front fenders, behind the wheel arches. At the back, the automaker installed an upgraded bumper that featured a set of thin vertical vents on the outer corners, while underneath it, the CLS kept the same four rectangular exhausts as its predecessor. From its profile, the CLS 63 AMG featured a set of 19” light-alloy wheels fitted with 255/35 tires up front and 285/30 tires to the rear axle. Inside, the most significant change was for the infotainment unit. The automaker replaced the formerly used small color display neatly integrated into the dashboard with an 8” landscape-oriented screen mounted into a free-floating position. Even though it looked like an aftermarket piece of equipment, it was all original and was controlled by the same rotary dial housed on the center console behind the gear selector. Like its predecessor, the 2014 CLS63 AMG featured high-bolstered bucket seats for the front passengers and a bench profiled for two in the back, separated by a center console fitted with cup holders. Under the hood, the automaker kept the same 5.5-liter V8 powerplant, helped by two turbochargers. In the AMG 63 clothing, it offered 550 HP, while the AMG 63 S 4Matic version added another 27 ponies to the pack. In addition, the latter version was offered with an all-wheel-drive system. Both versions sent their power via an AMG Speedshift MCT 7-speed automatic (multi-clutch) gearbox. For better handling, the automaker tuned the suspension and added a negative camber for the front axle. Moreover, Mercedes-Benz also enlarged the front axle's track by 24 millimeters (0.95”).",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""CLS 63 AMG"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": ""Large"",  ""overall-design"": [""Sleek"", ""Powerful"", ""Luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""Sloped""],    ""grille"": [""Diamond-pattern""],    ""hood"": [""Sculpted""],    ""headlights"": [""Multibeam LED""],    ""bumper"": [""A-shaped"", ""Massive side scoops""],    ""wheel"": [""19” light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [""High-bolstered""],    ""roof"": [""Sleek""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""Rectangular""]  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ C-Klasse Coupe,"In 2015, at the Frankfurt Auto Show, Mercedes-Benz unveiled its C-Class coupe. It replaced both the CLC, which was more like a three-door premium hatchback. The streamlined design, with frameless doors, made the car look like a convertible with hard-top. The high, ascending, beltline inspires force and performance. Its suspension was lowered by 15 mm (0.6”) compared to the sedan version. For a sportier look, it featured standard 17” light-alloy wheels and 19” as an option. The Coupe came with H7 halogen headlamps fitted as standard, and two LED variants as options. One with simple illumination and a “LED Intelligent Light System” with Adaptive Highbeam Assist that switched from low to high-beam depending on the traffic ahead. Inside, a centrally positioned free-standing display was available with 7” as standard and an 8.4” screen available for the COMMAND Online optional unit. An optional head-up display displayed information directly into the driver's field of vision in front of the windscreen. It displayed the current speed, posted speed limits, navigation instructions, and DISTRONIC messages - depending on the selected settings. The C-Class Coupe was offered with two gasoline engines with different outputs ranging from 156 hp from a 1.6-liter unit up to a 2.0-liter four-pot engine that offered up to 245 hp. For the diesel, it had a 2.2-liter unit with two power options of 170 hp and 204 hp, respectively. The transmission was standard with a 6-speed manual, or, depending on the engine, a 7-speed or a 9-speed, both with dual-clutch.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""C-Class Coupe"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""streamlined"", ""convertible-like"", ""sporty"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""frameless""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""high"", ""ascending""],    ""headlights"": [""H7 halogen"", ""LED options"", ""adaptive""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""17” light-alloy"", ""19” optional""],    ""doors"": [""frameless""],    ""roof"": [""hard-top""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ EQT,"The German automaker expanded its EV lineup with an LCV-based minivan fit not just for urban environments but also for those who like to go camping and have a power source available. Developed together with Renault, the EQT boasted a higher level of comfort and amenities, on par with Mercedes' customers' demands. Even though it wasn't a luxury vehicle, it still provided more than just an MPV transformed from a utility van. The EQT sported a front fascia that tried to resemble those installed on the rest of the EQ range, although not as fancy. It still featured two LED daytime running lights enclosed in the headlights and a reversed trapezoidal grille between headlamps. Moreover, the lower bumper featured side scoops slightly taller than the air intake that they flanked. Still, the car didn't need that much cooling area since it was electric, so most of it was just decoration. From its profile, the tall greenhouse provided generous window areas on the sides. To access the vehicle, customers could use the regular front doors and the side sliding ones. Finally, at the back, a wide tailgate provided generous access to the trunk area. Inside, Mercedes installed a neat-looking dashboard with rounded, waved shapes. Atop the center stack, between the round central vents, the automaker placed the screen for the MBUX infotainment unit. The high-mounted seats were typical for an LCV and also comfortable. At the back, there were three individual seats that customers could slide, fold or remove, depending on their needs. Power was entrusted to a 90 kW (121 hp) motor that sent its torque to the front wheels only. It was fed by a battery pack with a usable capacity of 45 kWh.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""EQT"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""LCV-based minivan"",  ""overall-design"": [""neat"", ""functional"", ""electric"", ""spacious"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""tall""],    ""grille"": [""reversed trapezoidal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""enclosed""],    ""bumper"": [""decorative"", ""side scoops""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""side sliding""],    ""roof"": [""tall greenhouse""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ EQS SUV,"With the 2023 Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV, the German carmaker was one step closer to its goal of producing exclusively electric vehicles starting in 2039. Designed as a flagship SUV model for the carmaker, the EQS shared its architecture with the EQS Salon, sharing the same wheelbase. Still, it was over 20 cm (7.9”) taller. Mercedes-Benz also said that the production was completely CO2 neutral, which made the vehicle more appealing to environmentalists around the world. Last but not least, thanks to its performance, it was also interesting for those looking for a fast SUV. The front fascia followed the same design language as the EQS sedan, with a black panel instead of the main grille that sported the three-pointed-star chromed badge. In addition, an LED daytime running light stripe crossed the upper side of the front section from one headlamp to the other. At the same time, the bumper sported a lower A-shaped grille flanked by two side-scoops. These elements were needed to cool the battery pack and the front rotors, respectively. Overall, the EQS SUV resembled the GLS, its internal combustion-powered cousin. Inside, the carmaker placed the same three-touchscreens design as in the EQS Sedan: one for the instrument panel, one on the center stack for the infotainment unit, and the third display in front of the passenger. At the back, the carmaker provided plenty of room for three passengers. Moreover, the trunk could hold up to four golf bags. Mercedes-Benz offered the SUV with a choice of electric motors and two different transmission versions: rear or all-wheel drive. The base version received a rear motor only. At the same time, the top performer got two more powerful motors that sent their torque in all corners.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""Tall"",  ""overall-design"": [""Flagship"", ""CO2 neutral"", ""Performance-oriented"", ""Resembles GLS"", ""Spacious interior""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""Black panel"", ""Three-pointed-star chromed badge""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED daytime running light stripe""],    ""bumper"": [""Lower A-shaped grille"", ""Side-scoops""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ Citan,"Mercedes-Benz introduced Citan’s second generation in 2021, and, like its predecessor, it was based on the same platform as the Renault Kangoo. But the biggest news was that it was the last new van designed with an internal combustion engine for the German brand. After that, all new models were designed for electric motors. Like its predecessor, the 2021 Citan was available either as a panel van or passenger vehicle. They both shared the same front fascia with a three-slat grille and swept-back headlights. On the lower side of the bumper, the carmaker installed a wide, black grille that contained the optional fog lights. On the sides, the MPV was available with two doors at the front and up to two sliding ones for the rear passengers or to access the cargo area. The van-version received a pair of unequal side-hinged doors in the back while the passenger version got a tailgate. Moving inside, the customers will discover some bits and pieces from the Citan’s French cousin, but the overall appearance was clearly inspired by other Mercedes-Benz vehicles. The passenger seat could fold down flat for the van version, thus extending the loading length through the 90 degrees swiveling wall that divided the cabin from the cargo area. In addition, the passenger version got a 1/3-2/3 split-folding bench. Thus, the vehicle could have been used as a utility vehicle for the week and as a family van for the weekend. Under the hood, the German carmaker installed a small choice of engines, either gasoline or diesel. The car featured either a six-speed manual or a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox, depending on the options.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Citan"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""modern"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""swept-back""],    ""grille"": [""three-slat""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [""wide"", ""black""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sliding"", ""unequal side-hinged"", ""tailgate""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ EQS,"The electric-car frenzy caught the big German carmaker and introduced an electric luxury vehicle on the market in 2021: the EQS. With more and more carmakers joining the electric revolution, Mercedes-Benz couldn’t just sit and wait to see what will go next, and it developed a completely new car in its lineup: the EQS. It started with a blank sheet of paper and moved forward until it made one of the most luxurious electric cars on the market. With a drag resistance of just 0.20, it was the most aerodynamic production car in the world to that date. Despite its size and height, it could cut through the air seamlessly. At the front, the car featured a closed upper grille and a lower grille with shutters needed to cool the batteries and the electrical system. A pair of side-scoops adorned with horizontal slats completed the elegant yet aggressive look of the front fascia. The extended greenhouse connected the A-pillars to the D-pillars with an arch towards the rear taillights. Strangely though, the EQS featured physical rear-view mirrors while other carmakers already replaced them with rear-view cameras. Inside, the main attraction was the dashboard fitted with three large screens: one in front of the driver, one in front of the front passenger, and the third one filling the center stack. In addition, the driver has a new steering wheel with buttons incorporated on the rim instead of the spokes. Thanks to the big wheelbase, the rear passengers could enjoy plenty of legroom and enough headroom due to the extended roof. The powertrain offered a rear motor (eATS) for the base model or dual motors for the 4Matic version.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""EQS"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""aerodynamic"", ""elegant"", ""aggressive"", ""seamless""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""extended""],    ""grille"": [""closed"", ""lower with shutters""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""big""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""extended""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ EQS SUV Maybach,"In 2023, the German automaker introduced the first full electric Mercedes-Maybach EQS SUV on the market, trying to outpace its main competitor, Bentley, with this electron-powered luxurious vehicle. Mercedes-Benz revived the Maybach brand in 1997 as a competitor for Rolls-Royce. It created a few limousines based on the same platform as the Mercedes-Benz S-Class but failed. In 2013, it decided to pull the plug on that brand, and then, in 2015, it re-invented it as a trim level for the S-Class and then for the GLS. Eventually, when the electrification era started to pick up speed, it created the Mercedes-Maybach EQS SUV based on the Mercedes-EQS SUV. As a result, it was the first automaker to provide a super-luxurious production vehicle fitted with an electric motor under its skin. While the overall shape of the Mercedes-Maybach EQS SUV was similar to the Mercedes-EQS SUV, there were significant changes to the bodywork and, most importantly, to the interior. For instance, the front fascia featured a broad grille with vertical slats on the panel, which elegantly concealed the radar for the advanced safety systems that equipped the big and heavy SUV. The daytime running lights created a line above the grille connecting the headlights and creating a luxurious look, while on the lower bumper on the side scoops, the automaker made a mesh styling formed by Maybach’s logo. From its profile, the rounded shape of the vehicle was available with a two-tone paint scheme, while on the D-pillars that flanked the tailgate placed the Maybach badge. However, the most significant changes compared to the Mercedes-EQS SUV were noticed inside the vehicle. The leather-wrapped interior with diamond stitching on the seats was unique for this super-luxurious vehicle. In addition, the wood trims with aluminum inserts mixed together well with the standard MBUX Hyperscreen and Maybach-specific animation at startup. The trims around the round instruments were in rose gold, which was a signature feature of the brand. In the back, the automaker installed two individual reclining seats with heating, ventilation, and massaging functions. Between them, Mercedes-Maybach placed a center console fitted with a cooler that could host a champagne bottle. Furthermore, there were two metallic glasses that could stick to the magnetic pad that those seated in the back could use as a table. Under the skin, the automaker installed its best electric drivetrain available that combined two motors with a total output of 484 kW (658 hp) and a maximum torque of 950 Nm (701 lb-ft.). For the Mercedes-Maybach EQS SUV, the automaker also used its most advanced platform fitted with all-wheel-drive and all-wheel-steering. Moreover, the adaptive air suspension could raise or lower the vehicle to allow it to pass over some obstacles, even though it was not an off-road vehicle.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mercedes-Maybach EQS SUV"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""big and heavy"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""rounded"", ""two-tone paint scheme"", ""elegant"", ""unique""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""vertical slats"", ""elegant""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""daytime running lights"", ""luxurious""],    ""bumper"": [""lower bumper"", ""side scoops"", ""mesh styling""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""rounded shape"", ""two-tone paint scheme"", ""Maybach badge""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [],    ""interior"": [""leather-wrapped"", ""diamond stitching"", ""wood trims"", ""aluminum inserts"", ""MBUX Hyperscreen"", ""Maybach-specific animation"", ""rose gold trims"", ""reclining seats"", ""heating"", ""ventilation"", ""massaging functions"", ""center console"", ""cooler"", ""champagne bottle holder"", ""metallic glasses"", ""magnetic pad"", ""electric drivetrain"", ""all-wheel-drive"", ""all-wheel-steering"", ""adaptive air suspension""]  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ A-Class Sedan,"The Mercedes-Benz A-Class L Sedan is the newest sedan to debut in the three-pointed star's compact car family, having been unveiled at the Auto China 2018 motor show in Beijing. With sales reserved for the Middle Kingdom and developed with Chinese customers in mind, the A-Class L Sedan is exclusively manufactured by Beijing Benz Automotive Co., Ltd (BBAC),  which is a partnership between Daimler AG and BAIC Motor. Available since 2018, the A-Class L Sedan can be powered by one of two four-cylinder gasoline engines that are also available in the fourth-generation Mercedes-Benz A-Class hatchback and the regular A-Class Sedan, which is virtually identical save for the standard-sized wheelbase and rear doors. A major center of attention during the model's development was the increased knee room for the rear passengers, so the A-Class L Sedan's wheelbase has been increased by 60 mm to 2789 mm compared to the normal A-Class and A-Class Sedan. During the first year of production the car was only available with a turbocharged, 1.33-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine that offers two power outputs, 100 and 120 kW. Later on, a more powerful turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 140 kW on tap, sent to the front wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission that's available as standard. Like its platform cousins, the model is equipped with the latest driving assistance system, with active safety being at the highest level in its segment.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""A-Class L Sedan"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""compact"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloping""],    ""grille"": [""stylish""],    ""hood"": [""streamlined""],    ""headlights"": [""sleek""],    ""bumper"": [""modern""],    ""wheel"": [""standard-sized""],    ""doors"": [""regular""],    ""roof"": [""standard""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ CLE Cabriolet,"In 2024 Mercedes-Benz introduced the CLE convertible that replaced the previous C-Class Convertible (A205) and the E-Class Convertible (A238). This was not a new solution for the German automaker since it used it when it launched the first generation of the CLK (C208/A208) in 1997. Mercedes-Benz tried to convince customers that the open-top versions E-Class and the C-Class were very different, but they weren't that much, actually. Yes, there were some styling differences, some options that were or were not available on each model, but at the end of the day, those were mainly two-seat vehicles with a retractable rag-top. The main differences were in the engine performance, where the E-Class had access to higher-powered versions. But for the mainstream versions, these were the same. So, after two generations of distinct open-top versions for the C-Class and the E-Class, the German automaker returned to its former solution found with the CLK. The design team drew its inspiration when it penned the CLE Convertible from both the C-Class (W206) and the E-Class (W214). As a result, the lower part of the bumper featured the A-shaped lower grille inspired by the former, while the upper side of the front fascia resembled the one from the latter due to its chromed horizontal bar that adorned the main cooling area. Still, the headlights were distinct and were slimmer than its siblings, but they featured the same LED or Digital Light technology with them. From its profile, the open-top version was elegant yet sporty, thanks to the raked windshield that stretched above the front seats and also served as a roll-over protection system. In the back, the retractable roof was stored behind the rear seats. Finally, at the back, the deck was not as sloped as on its coupe sibling but featured the same taillights that shared their details with the C-Class. Inside, there were more C-Class-inspired elements, such as the dashboard, the seats, and the standard infotainment system. The driver fronted the same digital instrument cluster as in the W206. Atop the center stack, Mercedes-Benz installed a standard touchscreen for the infotainment system similar to the one from the C-Class, but with a graphic that resembled the E-Class. The automaker offered the vehicle with ARTICO man-made leather for the lower grades, while the upper trim levels could get a combination of ARTICO/Microcut upholstery, which was made from 60% recycled materials. As expected, Nappa leather was also an option. Those seated in the back on the comfortable seats didn't have the same legroom as inside the coupe version since the bench seat was pushed forward a bit to make room for the retractable folding roof. Mercedes-Benz installed a choice of diesel, gasoline, and hybrid drivetrains under the car's hood. In an era where most automakers started to ditch the oil burners, the German automaker kept those powerplants in its offer, but only for selected markets. All versions came fitted with the 9G-Tronic automatic transmission built by Mercedes-Benz.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""CLE Convertible"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""elegant"", ""sporty"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""sophisticated""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [""A-shaped"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""slimmer"", ""LED"", ""Digital Light""],    ""bumper"": [""lower A-shaped grille"", ""chromed horizontal bar""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""retractable""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ C-Class Cabriolet,"Mercedes-Benz launched a complete lineup for its C-Class range in 2014, completing its lineup in the following two years. In 2018, the whole range was facelifted. The 2016 Mercedes-Benz C-Class Cabriolet was the first convertible in the C-Class family. Previously, the C-Class platform was used for the CLK cabriolet. After two generations named CLK, the German car-maker decided to introduced a soft-top vehicle with the C-Class badge. It was the first time when that range featured four bodyworks: sedan, station-wagon, coupe, and convertible. In 2018, the C-Class was refreshed. Despite being only a couple of years old, the convertible followed the trend and got the new goodies from its brothers. The most important changes on the outside were done on the front and tail end with the new design for the headlights and taillights. For the front, LED headlamps were fitted as standard and there were other two choices for extended range (Multibeam and Ultra Range). The interior benefited from new integral-look seats with an overall sporty look. The center console was characterized by new materials and a new design. For the instrument cluster, the car was fitted with standard dials, but there was an option for a full-digital system. A good improvement was that the cabriolet the soft top could have been operated from the outside with the vehicle key. The engine lineup was opened by a small, 1.5-liter turbocharged gasoline engine, which offered 184 hp. The top versions for the gasoline units, apart from the AMG versions, offered 258 hp. For diesel version, the C-Class convertible was available with a 2.0-liter unit in with 194 and 245 hp, respectively.

MERCEDES BENZ Maybach EQS SUV,"After creating a SUV version for its electric EQS, namely the EQS SUV, the German automaker transformed the high-rider vehicle into its most luxurious electric car in its inventory, the Maybach EQS 680 SUV. Mercedes-Maybach was not only the first luxury SUV built under its badge but also the first EV in its class. It targeted other vehicles produced by Bentley or Rolls-Royce, which didn't have any full-electric cars in their lineups. But since the three-pointed-star brand had already experienced the power of the electrons on several vehicles, it took a leap of faith and stepped in with this high-rider luxobarge. Since it was based on the same platform and bodywork as the EQS SUV, the new contender in the luxury car market came with a similar shape. Yet, at the front, it sported a different design for the grille that sported thinner and more vertical slats than its Mercedes-Benz sibling. Even though these were just design elements, since they were not needed to cool the engine, it was an imposing image. In addition, the lower side scoops were adorned with Maybach's triangular logo and were surrounded on their outer and upper edges by a satin-chromed trim. To differentiate this luxury version more from the regular EQS SUV built under Mercedes-Benz's badge, the Maybach version got new, unique 21"" alloy wheels, with an option for a set of 22"" ones. Inside, the carmaker installed the three-screen layout design on the dashboard, also known as the Hyperscreen, as a standard feature. While the hardware looked similar to the one fitted in the MB's EQS SUV, here it had a different layout and new animations to enchant its customers. But, since it was a luxury vehicle, the rear seats were the most important ones from vehicle. For their occupants, the automaker installed a set of 11.6"" screens mounted on the back of the front seats. In addition, instead of the split-folding bench from its three-pointed-star sibling was replaced by two individual reclining seats separated by a tall center console. Power came from two electric motors, which, combined, provided 658 hp and over 700 lb-ft (950 Nm) of torque.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Maybach EQS 680 SUV"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""high-rider"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""imposing"", ""unique"", ""elegant"", ""powerful""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""similar shape""],    ""grille"": [""thinner"", ""vertical slats"", ""imposing""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""new"", ""unique"", ""21\"" alloy wheels"", ""22\"" option""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ EQV,"Mercedes-Benz was known for creating one of the most successful minivans in Europe, the V-Class. But when it turned them into electric vehicles, it also changed its name to the EQV. The German automaker was known for creating some of the most luxurious European minivans used by five-star hotels, airports, and other companies that needed shuttle vehicles. One of them was the V-Class, which has been built by the three-pointed star brand since 1996 and was also known as Vito and Viano. When Mercedes-Benz started to switch its production from internal combustion vehicles to EVs, the V-Class was also targeted, and, as a result, in 2017, the automaker launched the EQV. The EQV shared the same platform and bodywork with the V-Class (W447). Its front fascia looked luxurious, with LED headlights and daytime running lights following an organic shape. These flanked the main grille that sported a grille with horizontal slats where the carmaker’s badge took center stage. Still, since EVs didn’t need such a large cooling area, this was actually a panel. Cooling was made via the lower air intake placed in the apron. On the left side, also in the bumper, the automaker installed the charging port. From its profile, the MPV featured a raked frontal area followed by a panoramic windshield. Its side windows were subtly interrupted by the B and C-pillars, which were darkened, while at the back, a vertical tailgate ended the vehicle. The rear windscreen could’ve been opened independently from the large tailgate to easily access a storage area mounted upper in the luggage compartment. Inside, the automaker offered the EQV with a choice of six or seven seats, depending on the customers’ needs. At the front, the automaker tried to create a car-like experience with a wide dashboard fitted with vents that looked similar to those from the C-Class or E-Class. But unlike those passenger vehicles, the V-Class didn’t have a digital dashboard but a mix of analog and digital, with two large dials and a color LCD between them. In addition, atop the center stack, Mercedes-Benz added a ten-inch screen for the MBUX infotainment unit. Under the hood, the automaker installed the motor and the electronics. Unlike most EVs on the market, the EQV was front-wheel driven. But like most other electric vehicles, it had the battery pack underneath the floor to not affect the passenger area. The large battery pack, which provided up to 90 kWh of energy to the 150 kW (201 HP) motor, provided enough energy for up to 405 km (249 miles) on a single charge. To charge the car, customers could fill it up at 11 kW AC chargers or at 110 kW fast chargers.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""EQV"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""MPV"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""organic"", ""panoramic"", ""spacious"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""panoramic""],    ""grille"": [""luxurious"", ""horizontal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""organic""],    ""bumper"": [""integrated"", ""charging port""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sliding""],    ""roof"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ C-Klasse All-Terrain,"While the demand for crossovers and SUVs was still high, Mercedes-Benz tried to please its customers and added some ground clearance to the C-Class T-Model, transforming it into a vehicle able to cope with some unpaved roads. With the C-Class All-Terrain, the German carmaker finally offered a match for their main competitor in the segment, the Audi A4 Allroad. At the same time, BMW didn’t have anything similar to offer. Of course, the C-Class All-Terrain was not an off-road vehicle. It was more of a station wagon on stilts with a set of scratch-resistant claddings around the bodywork. At the front, the carmaker installed a new bumper than on the regular C-Class, with a black, trapezoidal cladding that mimicked an underbody shield. Also, the lower grille from the apron looked similar to those installed on other C-Class versions but with less cooling. From its sides, the higher ground clearance of the All-Terrain version was obvious. Also, the carmaker added scratch-resistant black rocker panels and overfenders. In the rear, the car sported a twin exhaust system under the bumper, flanking a plastic shield. While the exterior tried to look tougher, the interior was typical C-Class, but with unique upholsteries available on the options list. The MBUX sloped infotainment system on the upper side of the center console. It completely replaced the traditional center stack while the vents were integrated into the dashboard. As for the instrument cluster, Mercedes-Benz installed a standard 10.25” with an option for a 12.3” virtual cockpit display. The 40 mm (1.6”) higher ground clearance over the regular C-Class T-Model allowed the All-Terrain version to run better over snow-covered roads, grass, and unpaved roads. In addition, all versions received standard 4Matic all-wheel-drive systems and nine-speed automatic transmissions.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""C-Class All-Terrain"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""40 mm higher ground clearance"",  ""overall-design"": [""tougher exterior"", ""typical C-Class interior""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""trapezoidal cladding"", ""less cooling""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""new bumper"", ""black cladding""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""twin exhaust system"", ""under the bumper""]  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ CLE Coupe,"Mercedes-Benz introduced the CLE as a two-door version for both the E-Class and the C-Class. This is a familiar idea for the German automaker since it used it for the previous CLK generations built between 1997 and 2010. The German automaker wanted to spend less for a car that fills a niche for expensive, two-door vehicles, so it carried over parts and elements from the C-Class and the E-Class when it created the CLE. As a result, the 2024 Coupe from Mercedes-Benz slits between the previous C-Class Coupe and the E-Class Coupe in terms of size and interior space. In addition, it carried over engines from both four-door sedan versions of these well-known vehicles. From the design point of view, the front part of the car shared the A-shaped styling on the lower bumper with the C-Class (W206) and the wide grille with a single horizontal bar with the E-Class (W214). Of course, only the styling was shared, not the actual part and the same went with the headlights. The CLE's headlamps were specific for this model and were slimmer than on its siblings, as mentioned above. They were fitted with LED technology, and, as an option, customers could get the Digital Light headlights, with or without projection on the asphalt. From its profile, the CLE revealed its connection with the previous C-Class Coupe (C205), especially thanks to the shape of the side rear window that featured an upward kink on the lower side towards the C-pillar. At the back, the automaker created a short, sloped-down deck, like on a liftback. Yet, it was a proper three-box construction. Finally, the taillights looked closer in design with the C-Class than with the E-Class since the latter featured LEDs shaped like the three-pointed star logo of the brand. Inside, there were more C-Class-inspired elements, such as the dashboard, the seats, and the standard infotainment system. The driver fronted the same digital instrument cluster as in the W206. Atop the center stack, Mercedes-Benz installed a standard touchscreen for the infotainment system similar to the one from the C-Class, but with a graphic that resembled the E-Class. The automaker offered the vehicle with standard ARTICO man-made leather, while the upper trim levels could get a combination of ARTICO/Microcut upholstery, which was made from 60% recycled materials. As expected, Nappa leather was also an option. Unlike its main German rivals, Mercedes-Benz offered an option for a retractable panoramic glass roof. In the back, the CLE provided seating for two and just enough legroom for adult passengers thanks to the 2865 mm (112.8 in) wheelbase. Under the skin, the automaker installed a choice of gasoline, diesel, and hybrid drivetrains that sent power to the rear wheels or in all corners via a standard nine-speed automatic transmission.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""CLE"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""slits between C-Class Coupe and E-Class Coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""familiar"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""elegant"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""wide"", ""single horizontal bar""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""slimmer"", ""fitted with LED technology""],    ""bumper"": [""A-shaped styling""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""retractable panoramic glass""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ A-Klasse Saloon,"Mercedes-Benz introduced a final facelift for the A-Class' third generation (W177) in the fall of 2022, trying to give its compact-sized lineup a push before the model's change. For the 2022 model year, the German automaker didn't look like it focused too much on changing the car's exterior. Still, it made significant changes to the interior and, most importantly, to the vehicle's technical platform. Considered a compact-sized vehicle in Europe and subcompact in the U.S., the A-Class journey started in 1997 as a minivan. After two generations, Mercedes-Benz finally made a major change and transformed it into a regular hatchback. Later on, it also added a few other bodywork versions for it. For the 2022 model year, the A-Class Sedan featured a hood with two power bulges and a grille with a star pattern, and flat headlights (which are available with LEDs). At the same time, at the back, the automaker added a new diffuser and standard LED taillights for the entire range. In the sedan shape, the A-Class looked more like a shrunk version of the Mercedes-Benz CLS. Inside, the upgraded MBUX infotainment system with fingerprint recognition and new carbon fiber trim distinguished the facelifted version from its predecessor. In addition, the automaker dismissed the rotary knob from the center console since there wasn't needed anymore. The standard 7"" touchscreen could have been upgraded to two choices of 10.25"" units. A new flat-bottom steering wheel was on the options list and completed the luxurious yet sporty image of the car. The seats were made from 100% recycled materials. Under the hood, the automaker improved the engine lineup with electrified, 48-Volt architecture and mild-hybrid technology. One of the key features included in the entire range was the new belt-driven starter-generator (RSG). In addition, the automaker included dual-clutch gearboxes with seven or eight-speed transmissions.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""A-Class"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""compact/subcompact"",  ""overall-design"": [""compact"", ""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""elegant"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""star-patterned""],    ""hood"": [""power bulges""],    ""headlights"": [""flat"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""new diffuser""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""new""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ SLC-Class,"In 1996, Mercedes-Benz released the SLK and caused a sensation. 20 years later, the SLK was released with a new name. In 2016, the old SLK became the new SLC-Class in order to align with Mercedes-Benz's new nomenclature scheme. The first initials mean the same thing - Sport Leicht (German for ""Sport Light"") - while the letter C means the model is based on the C-Class. However, the 2016 Mercedes-Benz SLC (R172) was not entirely new, being a facelifted SLK. Changes included redesigned front and rear ends, with up-to-date bumpers, headlights, grille and stoplights. New rims and color options were part of the change as well, while the interior got a new steering wheel, redesigned seats, center console and dashboard. The car was equipped with heated seats and AIRSCARF, a neck-heating system that was available as an optional. The interior was luxurious and two new colors were available for the perforated Nappa leather. The infotainment gained new features and the optionals list grew a few more entries. The folding roof operated up to 40 km/h and there was a new automatic trunk separator. Other technical features included Active Brake Assist which was installed by default. An interesting feature that was still unique and characteristic to the SLC was the panoramic vario-roof with Magic Sky Control – the driver and passengers had the possibility to lighten or darken the glass roof at the touch of a button.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""SLC-Class"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""facelifted"", ""up-to-date"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""redesigned""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""up-to-date""],    ""bumper"": [""up-to-date""],    ""wheel"": [""new rims""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""panoramic vario-roof""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ EQC,"With the electric revolution already started, Mercedes-Benz had to work fast and launch electric models on the market to keep up with its competitors, and the EQC was the first model on its lineup. At the same time, it created the Mercedes-EQ as an electric-only brand. The German automaker joined the bandwagon of the electric car revolution and introduced its first three-pointed star badged full-electric vehicle in 2019. Previously, Mercedes-Benz produced just the tiny smart fortwo with an electric drive, but the EQC was its first battery-based EV. It chose a crossover platform for that since it allowed it to install a larger battery in the floor. Moreover, even though it was its first EV, it was fitted with everything that a Mercedes-Benz customer had expected from this premium brand. On the outside, the EQC featured a front fascia with a wide black panel at the front adorned by two horizontal chromed slats. It mimicked a grille, but since electric vehicles didn’t need large cooling areas, it was mostly covered. The headlights that flanked it featured LED technology for lower energy consumption, and, in the lower bumper, the automaker placed an A-shaped lower grille and two scoops and small vertical slats that improved aerodynamics. From its profile, the crossover revealed a steep windshield and a slightly sloped-down roofline emphasized by the window line, while at the back, the raked-forward tailgate adorned by a roof spoiler tried to create a dynamic look for the vehicle. Inside, the automaker installed a pair of bucket seats at the front with mild bolstering and a bench seat for three in the back. The completely digital dashboard featured an instrument cluster fronting the driver, continued by the infotainment’s system screen placed atop the center stack. Both were covered by the same piece of glass, creating the image of a single, wide display. The steering wheel featured two metallic paddles behind it, similar to those used to change gears in ICE-powered vehicles, only here were used for the regenerative braking system. Between the front seats, Mercedes-Benz installed a center console that housed the controls for the MBUX infotainment system and a large storage area underneath the armrest. The trunk area could hold up to 501 liters (17.7 cu-ft.) of luggage, which could have been expanded by lowering the flat-folding rear bench’s seatback. To power the vehicle, the automaker installed two electric motors, one for each axle, which provided up to 300 kW (408 PS, or 402 HP). But the main advantage was the instant torque of 765 Nm (564 lb-ft.) that could make all tires squeak at launch. Thanks to the 80 kWh battery pack, the vehicle promised a range of 450 km (280 miles) when driven efficiently.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""EQC"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""dynamic"", ""electric"", ""steep windshield"", ""sloped-down roofline""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""steep""],    ""grille"": [""wide black panel"", ""horizontal chromed slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""flanked"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""bumper"": [""A-shaped lower grille"", ""scoops"", ""small vertical slats""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloped-down"", ""roof spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""raked-forward""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ EQE,"Mercedes-Benz introduced its electric flagship EQS in 2021 and, just a few weeks after its mid-size representative, the EQE. In 2021, it was obvious that electrification and the electric car had to be part of a brand development. Even though Mercedes-Benz didn’t rush to launch new products, it created surprising products when it did. While the EQS was on par with the price for a regular, IAC-powered S-Class, the EQE came close to its non-electric stablemate, the E-Class. Yet, the EQE didn’t share its platform with that, but with the bigger brother, the EQS. The carmaker made the EQE energy efficient, which is why it chose to create a different shape for it. Its ascending front side was continued by an arched greenhouse ended with angled C-pillars and the rear window. It was a fluid curve, from front to the sloped, short trunk lid. The car’s front resembled the same front fascia as the EQS, with a closed, black panel instead of a grille flanked by the LED headlights. On the lower side of the bumper, the carmaker added a functional ventilation grille needed to cool the batteries and other electronic components. Inside, Mercedes-Benz included a Sci-Fi cockpit with three wide displays on the dashboard: one for the instrument cluster, a touch screen as a center stack, and a 12.3” touch-screen for the front passenger. It almost removed any physical buttons, apart from a small group placed on the center console. Unlike its internal combustion stablemate, the EQE featured a second storage area under the center console since no transmission tunnel or gearbox was installed there. Mercedes-Benz introduced electric motors for the 2021 EQE and offered it with a rear- or an all-wheel-drive system with permanent magnets motors. In addition, a rear-steer axle was available as an option.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""EQE"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""energy efficient"", ""fluid curve"", ""ascending front side""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""arched""],    ""grille"": [""closed"", ""black panel""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""functional"", ""ventilation""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ T-Class,"After the failure of the Mercedes-Benz Citan, the German carmaker waited a few years before making a comeback in that segment with the introduction of the 2022 T-Class. Mercedes-Benz didn't know how to build front-wheel driven cars, so it cut a deal with the Renault-Nissan Alliance and created a new range of vehicles. It was a fruitful experience, and the A-Class received French-built engines while Nissan and Renault-Nissan got the seven-speed automatic gearbox from the German carmaker. But that was only a part of the deal. Renault built the Mercedes-Benz Citan as a badge-engineered Renault Kangoo. Sadly for the three-pointed-star brand, their LCV was sold in low numbers. But they tried again in 2022 and launched the T-Class, also based on the same platform as the Kangoo. It took Mercedes-Benz two years to create a new front fascia for the Kangoo, but it made it right. The headlights followed the same shape as the rest of the carmaker's products, resembling those installed on the A-Class, C-Class, and others. They flanked a broad grille with three horizontal slats and the company's badge in the middle. On the apron, the wide lower grille sported a pair of foglights as an option. From its sides, the two-box bodywork featured two sliding doors for the rear passengers, while the front ones were regular. Since the T-Class and its French sibling, the Kangoo, were developed as LCVs, they featured a flat rear end with a tailgate or two-section door as an option. The interior, on the other hand, is crafted with Mercedes-Benz quality and features ARTICO man-made leather for both T-Class trim levels. An MBUX infotainment system with a 7"" touchscreen was placed atop the center stack. Under the hood, the carmaker installed Renault-sourced engines, either gasoline or diesel. All versions were turbocharged and with direct injection.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""T-Class"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""compact"", ""two-box bodywork"", ""French-built engines"", ""sliding doors"", ""flat rear end""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""three horizontal slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""resembling A-Class and C-Class""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sliding for rear passengers""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ EQE SUV,"After successfully launching its new electric vehicles, such as the EQE and EQS, the German automaker stepped up its game in the electric SUV segment, where it already had a saying, but it was not enough. Mercedes-Benz introduced the EQE SUV to compete against its traditional competitors from its home market, such as the BMW iX and the Audi e-tron. But it didn't rush on launching new models. First, it developed the EQE sedan, and only after that it marched forward with expanding its SUV lineup. Even though it was shorter than the EQE sedan, the SUV version appeared more commanding due to its height. Moreover, the front fascia showcased a big black flat area on the front fascia flanked on the sides by LED headlights. Depending on the version, the lower bumper featured an A-shaped center grille needed to cool the electronics and the battery pack of the vehicle, and that was flanked by two side scoops that channeled the air onto the sides of the bodywork, reducing the drag resistance. Finally, at the back, the car's profile revealed an SUV shape with a raked-forward rear windscreen. Inside, the main focus was on the dashboard, where the automaker offered an option for a Hyperscreen that combined the instrument cluster, the MBUX infotainment display, and the third screen in front of the side passenger. In addition, for occupants' comfort, Mercedes-Benz installed a standard heat pump that took the heat from the vehicle's motors and transferred it inside to warm the cabin. The vehicle was fitted with either one or two motors, the latter being for the all-wheel drive versions, whereas the optional second power unit was for the front axle. But, even the 4Matic models could have the front motor disengaged in normal driving mode to save battery and help the car achieve a maximum of 590 km (367 miles) of range.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""EQE SUV"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""shorter, commanding height"",  ""overall-design"": [""commanding"", ""raked-forward rear windscreen"", ""SUV shape""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked-forward""],    ""grille"": [""A-shaped center grille""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""lower"", ""A-shaped center""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MERCEDES BENZ Vito,"The Mercedes-Benz Vito has been a success since its debut in 1996. The mid-sized van is known for its extreme versatility and is mostly used in small and medium-sized enterprises. The story continued in 2020 with a facelift version, bringing a redefined look and smart features. One of the major highlights was the introduction of the new eVito Tourer, with 150 kW and a 421-km electric range. A new diesel engine generation is also available with up to 239 hp. Other features include AIRMATIC air suspension, improved safety with the DISTRONIC and BAS, an improved reversing camera, digital rear view mirror, revised infotainment portfolio, new interior and a new radiator grille. The halogen headlamps can be replaced by the optional Intelligent Light System and can be extended to include the Highbeam Assist Plus – which reacts adaptively to changing visibility conditions. The Vito Tourer mostly transports people and goods and is available with the BASE, PRO and SELECT trim lines As a standard assistance system, the Tourer comes with a tire pressure loss detection and can be optionally equipped with Active Parking Assist, Blind Spot Assist and Lane Keeping Assist. For the first time, DISTRONIC is also available for the Vito. While equipped with the active distance assist, the vehicle can accelerate by itself and brake using the necessary braking power to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles in front. The impressive eVito Tourer has the same exterior design as its ICE brothers and is equipped with a 90 kWh lithium-ion battery, facilitating a range of up to 421 kilometers. The battery can be charged from 10% to 80% in under 45 minutes at a rapid charging station.",MERCEDES BENZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mercedes-Benz Vito"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""mid-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""versatile"", ""redefined"", ""smart"", ""improved"", ""adaptive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""new"", ""revised""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""halogen"", ""optional Intelligent Light System"", ""Highbeam Assist Plus""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MG ZS,"Based on the same shape and size as its gasoline-powered cousin, the ZS, the EV version shows a new approach to the market, following the EV trend. The 2021 ZS EV came when a world pandemic and a chip-shortage issue affected all the carmakers. Yet, the Chinese carmaker who owned the once-famous British brand found a way to attract new buyers. While the previous version of the ZS EV featured a smaller battery pack, the 2021 model featured a larger one as an option. Also, it came with new clothing. Unlike its predecessor, the 2021 model featured a body-colored front fascia, which lost its mesh-grille design from the gasoline-powered version. The carmaker's designers didn't struggle too much with that, and it mostly looked like a panel with drilled holes in it rather than a true grille meant for cooling. It hid just the charging port, which was placed behind the chromed MG badge. Its LED headlights featured an angular shape with sharp corners and a rounded lower area. Somehow, they resembled the lamps installed on other vehicles. From its sides, the 17"" light-alloy wheels showed a five-spoke design. Inside, the MG ZS EV featured an interior similar to those found on the gasoline-powered version. Yet, the center console looked simpler since it didn't have the gear stick on it. There, the carmaker placed the rotary button for the driving programs (PRND) and a few switches for driving modes, energy recuperation, and battery status. Since it was one of the cheapest cars in its class, the carmaker couldn't afford to install expensive materials.",MG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""ZS EV"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""similar to gasoline-powered ZS"",  ""overall-design"": [""new approach to market"", ""body-colored front fascia"", ""17\"" light-alloy wheels"", ""angular LED headlights"", ""simpler center console""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""body-colored"", ""mesh-less"", ""meant for charging port""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angular"", ""sharp corners"", ""rounded lower area""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""17\"" light-alloy"", ""five-spoke design""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MG HS,"MG introduced its largest SUV on the market, the HS, in 2019, claiming a seat at the table of compact crossovers in specific markets, fighting against vehicles like the Honda CR-V and the Toyota Rav4. In 2006, the Chinese automaker SAIC bought the British brand MG and moved the production to China. After years of struggle, the automaker started to increase its presence in the British and the European market. At first, there were mostly refreshed and polished older models of the MG developed in the ‘90s, but then, the automaker launched newly developed products. While its presence was not noticeable outside the UK, it was later exported to other European countries. Then, in 2018, the HS appeared, trying to compete in the compact crossover segment. The car’s front sported a broad grille extended downwards into the front bumper and surrounded by a chromed rim. Its 3D pattern mesh, named “stellar field” by the manufacturer, and the center-mounted MG badge looked modern for the time when the car was introduced. Moreover, the LED headlights, with their organic shape and swept-back profile, added a touch of luxury to the car’s look. Lower, on the apron, MG installed an additional slimmer air intake flanked by a pair of taller side scoops that sported the fog lamps. From its profile, the crossover featured blackened B- and C-pillars and chromed window trims that surrounded them. To create the image of higher ground clearance, the automaker added black side sills and trims extended on the lower side of the sculptured door panels, while at the back, the raked-forward tailgate was adorned by a roof spoiler at its upper side. Finally, the rear fascia revealed wide LED taillights extended from the quarter panels onto the tailgate, and underneath the bumper, two tailpipes mounted on the sides. Inside the cabin, MG put everything it had in its parts basket. As a result, the driver enjoyed a semi-digital instrument cluster fitted with two large analog dials for the rev counter and the speedometer that flanked a display. Atop the center stack, the automaker installed a ten-inch touchscreen for the infotainment system in a free-floating position. From the styling point of view, the HS was a far cry from where the brand was just five years before. But the automaker didn’t forget MG’s sporting heritage and installed high-bolstered front seats, even though this vehicle was a compact crossover, not a hot-hatch. In the back, the split-folding bench could comfortably accommodate three passengers, and the center tunnel was not too high. Under the hood, the automaker installed a choice of two gasoline-powered engines, depending on the market. One was a turbocharged 1.5-liter inline-four powerplant, and the second option was a two-liter turbocharged unit. Both versions were paired with a standard six-speed manual or a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox. Power went in all corners as standard.",MG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""HS"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""compact crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""modern"", ""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""sculptured"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""chromed"", ""3D patterned""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""organic shape"", ""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [""front extended"", ""slimmer air intake"", ""fog lamp side scoops""],    ""wheel"": [""black side sills"", ""trims extended""],    ""doors"": [""blackened B- and C-pillars"", ""chromed window trims""],    ""roof"": [""raked-forward"", ""adorned by roof spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": [""two tailpipes""]  }}```"
MG MG 5,"MG was raised as a sports car manufacturer, but those days were already gone when the British brand was acquired by Nanjing Automobile Group in 2006 and turned into a brand mostly oriented towards mass-market. The Chinese carmaker knew that there would be a high demand for mass-produced electric cars. So, after developing a dedicated platform for more vehicles, it introduced the MG5 in the summer of 2021. This BEV (Battery-Electric Vehicle) was aimed at regular families and provided the basic stuff for a no-nonsense automobile. Its exterior design might be called bland, at most, with triangular scoops placed on the sides of the front lower bumper, pointed towards the car's center. While the front fascia didn't feature an upper grille, it sported a wider one on the apron since it didn't need it. Its narrow headlights featured LED lamps. From its sides, the waved beltline started from the front fenders and went all the way to the taillights. Since the car had the battery pack installed in the floor, it forced the designers to raise the cabin, leading to a taller cabin, providing a crossover stance for the MG5. Inside, the carmaker placed a TFT display in front of the driver for the main instrument cluster. An infotainment system with an eight-inch touchscreen atop the center stack. A gear selector sat between the front seats on the center console. It allows the driver to use different settings for the driving mode, including a one-pedal way. As for the families, the MG5 promised a 479 liters (16.4 cu-ft) of space in the trunk, which could be extended up to 1,456 liters (51.4 cu-ft) by folding the rear bench.",MG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""MG5"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""bland"", ""crossover stance""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""tall""],    ""grille"": [""wider""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""narrow"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""triangular scoops""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""raised cabin""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MG Marvel R,"MG introduced the Marvel R electric vehicle in 2021 as a new model in its lineup and presented it as the first full-electric station wagon on the market. The former British brand MG ended up in the Nanjing Automobile Group in 2006 and later, which merged into SAIC in 2007. But the respectable, century-old brand was revived and developed new products. In 2021, MG introduced the MG Marvel R Electric as the company's first electric station wagon. Previously, the carmaker offered two other electric vehicles, named MG5EV and MG ZS EV. With the Marvel R, the company opened a new chapter in its lineup. MG built the C-segment lifestyle SUV on a new platform. While it showed more like a crossover or a raised station wagon, the Marvel R aimed at European customers, not only at the British ones. The designers deleted the grille at the front and installed a panel under the LED strip used as a daytime running light. Two side scoops hosted the fog lights in the bumper, while the headlights showed a C-letter pattern on top of the fenders. Its waved, ascending beltline connected the front and rear lamps and formed a shoulder line over the rear wheel-arches. The arrow-like taillights pointed toward the car's center were connected via a horizontal red light strip in the back. Inside, the carmaker installed a big, 19.4"" touch-screen as a center stack, with a few physical buttons at the bottom and a 12.3"" digital instrument panel. The Marvel R was powered by three electric motors: one at the front and two in the rear, which offered 288 hp. Depending on the car's configuration, it provided a WLTP range of 400 km. The base version featured just two electric motors for the rear axle.",MG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""MG Marvel R"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""C-segment lifestyle SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""crossover"", ""raised station wagon"", ""European-focused"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""deleted"", ""replaced with LED strip""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""C-letter pattern"", ""modern""],    ""bumper"": [""side scoops"", ""fog lights""],    ""wheel"": [""rear wheel-arches""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""waved, ascending beltline""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""electric motors""]  }}```"
MG MG 4,"MG was known in the '60s for its sports cars, but, unfortunately for the British brand, it was near bankrupt when Austin Motors bought it. Later, the former Morris Garage automaker ended up in the same boat as Rover when it was bought by BMW, who sold them to Nanjing Automobile from China in 2005. Two years later, in 2007, the new owner was acquired by SAIC, a giant Chinese car maker, who decided to put more money into the British brand and save it. But for that, it had to move the production lines from Longbridge, in the UK, to China. But that wasn't a bad thing after all. After substantial investments in research, development, and re-tooling, MG was reborn as an EV maker. A new line of products emerged and started to conquer not just the Chinese market but the British one as well. After all, it was a beloved brand. So, fast forward to 2023, and the former Morris Garage car manufacturer launched a new model named MG 4 XPower. It wasn't a sports car in terms of looks, but it could drag race most supercars on the market. In addition, it didn't look bad at all. At the front, the car resembled the Lamborghini Urus with its triangular, angry-looking headlights. The lower bumper featured a trapezoidal grille flanked by a pair of oblique side scoops that cooled the front rotors. Their design was emphasized by LED daytime running lights. MG's design team created a profile that was a mix between a hot-hatch and an Urus with its raked-forward C-pillars. Finally, at the back, the tailgate was adorned at the top by a roof spoiler. Another hint that it was the XPower version of the MG 4 was noticed on the orange brake calipers marked with XPower lettering. Inside, the car looked more luxurious and sporty than its sibling, the MG 4. It featured high-bolstered bucket seats wrapped in an Alcantara and leather mix with red stitching. In addition, the flat bottom and thick steering wheel amplified the car's sporty feeling. In the rear, there was the same split-folding bench seat. In front of the driver, the automaker installed a display for drive modes and all the essential driving data. In addition, atop the center stack, the automaker placed a 10.25"" touchscreen for the infotainment system. Unfortunately, the automaker didn't put a turning knob for the volume, choosing to put two buttons instead for up and down. MG installed offered the 4 XPower with a standard all-wheel-drive system powered by electric motors for both axles with a total output of 435 PS (429 HP). But the automaker knew that sports car drivers couldn't be satisfied just with straight-line accelerations, so it fitted the vehicle with a torque vectoring system that braked the inside wheel during cornering to make the 4 XPower faster on turns. The energy came from a 64 kWh battery pack mounted under the floor, which also helped performance since it lowered the car's center of gravity.",MG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""MG 4 XPower"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""luxurious"", ""aggressive"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""angled""],    ""grille"": [""trapezoidal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""triangular"", ""angry-looking"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""lower"", ""trapezoidal""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""luxurious""],    ""roof"": [""spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": [""electric""]  }}```"
MG GS,"It was launched at the Shanghai Auto Motor Show in 2016 and, in the same year, it was shown at the London Motor Show, marking the sales start. It was an instant hit for the British market. The new SUV from MG came with two modern engines and with a look that resembled the traditional sporty image of the MG brand. Even though that the production is made in China, the chief-designer for the MG GS is a British car-designer. The GS took some of the older MG model's look as an inspiration theme. This made the car look British, but in a modern way. The compact-size SUV is built with all-wheel-drive or front-wheel-drive, but for UK it is available only with FWD. MG offers 1.5-liter and a 2.0-liter engines. Both use gasoline and are developed with General Motors and Opel, and both are turbocharged with direct injection. The engines offers 170 hp and 220 hp, making the compact SUV nimble enough. As for the inside, the MG doesn't offer too many options, except for two types of leather and a basic infotainment unit. The bluetooth is offered only starting with the middle trim level. The MG GS is available with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission.",MG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""MG GS"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""modern"", ""British-inspired""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""modern""],    ""hood"": [""traditional"", ""sporty""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MG MG 6,"The MG 6 was a small hatchback built by the British brand owned by the Chinese company SAIC. It was built on an older platform and but with a new design for the bodywork. When the Chinese company SAIC bought the Rover car company, it bought the rights for the MG brand, but not for the Rover brand. But it didn't matter for them. It used the name Rowe for some vehicles instead of Rover but the MG was kept as it was, with the same logo in the front. The MG 6 design looked like it was made on fast forward and the designers didn't have enough time to develop a car adapted for the British taste. The front fascia was almost covered with only a narrow opening in the grille to cool the engine. There was a bigger honeycomb grille in the lower part of the bumper. The headlights had an odd shape for that era. Some parts from the bodywork showed inspiration from the former Rover 75 design. Inside, the car featured a roomy interior for its class, but the thin front seats and the plain dashboard were not very pleasant. The car was fitted as standard with an in-dash navigation system placed in line with the instrument cluster, a climate control panel on the center stack, and power windows for all four. But the materials used were of poor quality. The good thing was that it featured a large trunk and split-folding rear bench backseat. The MG 6 was offered with a choice of two engines: 1.8-liter turbocharged gasoline and a 1.9-liter turbocharged diesel from Fiat. Both were mated to a standard 5-speed manual, which, by 2010 standards, was a gear too short. No automatic gearbox was available.",MG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""MG 6"",  ""year"": ""2010"",  ""size"": ""small hatchback"",  ""overall-design"": [""fast-forward design"", ""inspired by former Rover 75""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""narrow opening"", ""bigger honeycomb grille in lower part""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""odd shape""],    ""bumper"": [""lower part with bigger honeycomb grille""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MG MG 3,"Although the MG brand was no longer produced in Longbridge, Birmingham in the U.K., the name still had a very profound sound in British automotive history. But the MG3 was made in China. When the world economic crisis struck in 2007, some glorious brands ceased to exist and others were bought by foreign companies. MG-Rover group was purchased by SAIC, a Chinese state-owned automotive company. When it did the acquisition, only the MG name was sold. The Rover brand was kept by Jaguar-Land Rover, who was bought by Tata Motors, an Indian company. The first generation of the MG3 was a Rover Streetwise with a different badge on it. The second generation was introduced in 2013 and it was developed on that platform, which was the same for the Rover 25 and it was based on an older Honda platform. Its styling was more angular, with sculptured doors and sharp-looking headlights. The mesh-grille and the front bumper had an aggressive style. The cabin was a completely new design with a big infotainment system on the center stack. It had an Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. The instrument cluster still had some design cues that resembled the older MG brand. Being a supermini vehicle, it offered limited room for the rear seats, but it was just like the other supermini on the market. Under the hood, there was an updated version of the older 1.5-liter gasoline engine from General Motors. It didn't feature direct fuel injection or light pressure turbo. It was an old-school, chain-driven unit that produced 105 hp.",MG,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""MG3"",  ""year"": ""2013"",  ""size"": ""supermini"",  ""overall-design"": [""angular"", ""sculptured"", ""sharp-looking"", ""aggressive"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""mesh""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""sharp-looking""],    ""bumper"": [""aggressive""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MINI Countryman,"The all-wheel-drive MINI made to tackle unpaved roads and with a higher ground clearance to step over curbs returned on the market in late 2023 with an all-electric drivetrain, wearing the name Countryman SE. MINI was no longer a small British brand and was recognized worldwide for its abilities. But besides those related to sporty feelings and amazing handling, it also took its first steps into the crossover segment with the introduction of the Countryman in 2010. Its second generation came on the market six years later. By 2023, the subcompact luxury crossover reached its fourth generation, which, unlike its predecessors, was available not just with a choice of diesel or gasoline engines but also with two electric versions. The sportiest one fed by electrons was the SE, which could go on long country trips thanks to its all-wheel drive version that sported the badge ALL4. This was the first electric generation of the Countryman, and the exterior was affected substantially by this trend. As a result, at the front, the car didn’t have the classic MINI grille surrounded by an octagonal trim but by a panel that was black on its upper side, housing the charging port and a body-colored element on the lower side. Its headlights sported an LED signature light element with a closed angular shape inside the headlamps. From its profile, the car revealed its added five inches (ca. 30 cm) in length, making it more suitable to carry full-grown adults in the back. Unlike the MINI Cooper, the Countryman sported black overfenders around the wheel arches to emphasize the off-road-oriented characteristic. The tall greenhouse sported a roof that was available either in body color, white, black, or in a special mate satin-bronze shade. At the back, the automaker installed a vertical tailgate that sported a roof spoiler on its top, and the taillights were mounted on the quarter panels flanking it. Inside, the minimalist design of the cabin impressed with high-quality vegan materials. MINI used special fabric or artificial leather for the seats in the base trim level. The door cards and the dashboard were also covered with fabric, creating a relaxing ambiance for the car’s occupants. In front of the driver, the manufacturer installed a three-spoke steering wheel with physical buttons and a head-up display for main information. In addition, atop the center stack, the automaker placed a 9.5” touchscreen for the infotainment system. These elements were shared with the Cooper, but the vertical vents were unique for the Countryman. For the front occupants, MINI installed tall seats with bolstered areas and integrated headrests, while in the back was a split-folding bench seat where two adults could comfortably sit thanks to the longer wheelbase compared to the previous Countryman generation. The Countryman SE ALL4 was powered by a combination of electric motors for a total output of 230 kW (308 hp), making it the most potent Countryman to date. Its 433 km (269 miles) range was enough for short and medium trips across country roads or a picnic in nature.",MINI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Countryman SE"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""subcompact luxury crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""all-electric"", ""off-road-oriented"", ""minimalist"", ""sporty"", ""tall""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""angled""],    ""grille"": [""panelled"", ""black"", ""angular""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""closed angular shape""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""black overfenders""],    ""doors"": [""tall seats"", ""integrated headrests""],    ""roof"": [""body-colored"", ""white"", ""black"", ""satin-bronze""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MINI Convertible,"Pushing the boundaries of automotive engineering helped automakers create better, or even revolutionary, cars and the British brand MINI did the same again in 2023 when it launched the MINI Cooper SE Convertible. The British brand was famous for creating unusual vehicles. They were not just attractive-looking but also beautifully engineered. With a few exceptions, most of their cars were sold like hotcakes. Of course, they had their flops, but the Convertible version was not among them. Another success story was the MINI Cooper SE, which sported an electric motor instead of an ICE. So, the automaker tried its luck and combined these two vehicles. The result was the first-ever open-top EV on the market, produced in a limited 999 units. MINI made the vehicle available in two colors: Enigmatic Black and White Silver. Thus, these vehicles were easy to spot on the road. Also, the front fascia featured a black panel instead of the main grille. The car sported a body-colored bumper and, underneath it, a four-slat air intake to cool the electric drivetrain components. On the front fenders, behind the wheel wells, the automaker installed a set of vents fitted with a badge that said the car's production number. The automaker installed the charging port on the right-rear quarter panel, in the same place as the fuel-filler cap for ICE-powered versions of the MINI Convertible. Inside, the cockpit promised enough room for four adults, albeit those seated in the back didn't have too much legroom. At the front, the driver and side passenger enjoyed the leather-wrapped sports seats. In addition, these were also heated. No words about ventilation, though. On the lower spoke of the steering wheel, the automaker placed the specific badge of MINI Electric. The drivetrain was carried over from BMW and provided 181 hp (184 PS), and the battery pack provided enough juice for 201 km (125 miles).",MINI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""MINI Cooper SE Convertible"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""attractive"", ""open-top"", ""electric""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black panel""],    ""hood"": [""body-colored""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""body-colored""],    ""wheel"": [""front fenders vents""],    ""doors"": [""limited 999 units""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""charging port on right-rear quarter panel""]  }}```"
MINI Hatch,"MINI introduced the fourth generation of its three-door hatchback model in September 2023 and put more emphasis on the electrification of this model, offering it with a punchier version named SE. The British car evolved constantly after it was purchased by BMW and rushed through generations with more and more updates. Its first electric version was based on the ICE-powered platform, but that was changed in 2023. Then, the automaker created an electric platform for the model but didn’t ditch versions powered by internal combustion engines. Still, the SE came to prove to customers that they could still enjoy a small-sized vehicle, especially when it was equipped with a punchy motor. Furthermore, starting with the 2023 model year, the automaker finally decided to name the hatchback MINI Cooper, honoring the car’s legacy. From the outside, it was a mix of retro-styling and modern technology. At the front, the LEDs that encircled the headlights were used for turn signals and daytime running lights as well. The headlamps also featured LED blocks and flanked the octagonal front panel that resembled a grille. From its profile, the vehicle’s proportions and the characteristic design elements left no mistakes about the brand or the model. Still, the Cooper SE was exclusively available with a three-door bodywork, while its gasoline-powered sibling was still offered with a five-door variant. MINI created the Cooper SE with flush door handles and no overfenders, thus creating a flowing design. At the back, the slightly tilted forward tailgate was adorned at its top by a roof spoiler. Strangely, the rear taillights featured a triangular shape and sported a Matrix LED pattern that resembled the Union Jack. Inside, the cabin featured a minimalist design inspired by the original 1959 Mini created by Sir Alec Issigonis. Fronting the driver was a three-spoke steering wheel and the optional head-up display. The big and round, 9.5-inch touchscreen mounted atop the center stack featured a customizable background. As an option, the car could be equipped with a Harman Kardon sound system. All the materials were vegan and environmentally friendly. The bolstered front seats were fitted as standard with a mix of fabric and leatherette with an option for full artificial leather. In the back, the car offered enough room for two adults thanks to the vehicle’s long wheelbase for its size. The trunk offered 200 liters (7 cu-ft.) of space and was enough for a daily vehicle. The automaker installed a 218 hp (160 kW) motor in the MINI Cooper SE that powered the front wheels. Its performance was quite surprising, offering a 0 to 100 kph (0-62 mph) acceleration time of just 6.7 seconds. MINI said that the car could get a 250-mile (402 km) range with a fully charged battery pack that could hold 54.2 kWh.",MINI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""MINI Cooper SE"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""small-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""retro-styling"", ""modern"", ""minimalist"", ""flowing"", ""surprising""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""octagonal"", ""resembling""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED-encircled"", ""triangular"", ""Matrix LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""flush"", ""three-door""],    ""roof"": [""tilted"", ""adorned"", ""spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MINI Clubman,"MINI is the only premium brand that is building only small class vehicles. The carmaker evolved from one product to an entire range of small vehicles, which includes everything from three-door hatchbacks to models like the latest Clubman, which is a four-door hatchback. But it is a four-door in an unusual way. In the company's history there was a model back in the days that was intended to be used as a delivery car. Some sort of small MPV but in a British style and it was called the Clubman. The name remained, but its destination changed. Now it is a fancy car with two doors on each side and a swing-out double-door on the rear. This makes it the only hatchback with six doors on the market. The new Clubman will have three or four-cylinder engines, FWD or AWD, paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or an automatic transmission with 7 or 8 gears, depending on the engine. The base model is offered with only 106 HP, but the top version, the Clubman John Cooper Works has 306 HP and is AWD. Inside, the main theme revolves around style, glamor and fancy options, such as the infotainment system that allows Android Auto and Apple CarPlay with the touchscreen on the center console.",MINI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Clubman"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""small"", ""fancy"", ""British style"", ""six-door hatchback""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""two doors on each side"", ""swing-out double-door on the rear""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MINI Classic,"While a three-door S version was already natural for the MINI, the 5-door version meant that someone could take the same car for its personal pleasure and to use it as a family car as well. MINI introduced the fourth generation of the Cooper S in 2021. The carmaker didn't offer a 5-door version for the sporty model since the brand's revival in 2000, but soon the customers started to ask for a more punchy version with a set of doors for the rear passengers. Thus, they could claim that they bought a family car. While some purists claimed that a 5-door version was blasphemy for the MINI, others just nodded their heads and paid for it. It was a truly practical sports hatchback vehicle in the mini segment. The fourth generation of the MINI Cooper S four-door featured a striking front fascia with a grille surrounded by a piano-black trim. A set of additional air-intakes made their way in the front apron to feed the turbocharged engine. The Cooper S was available with an 18"" Pulse Spoke two-tone set of wheels apart from the standard 17"" ones from its sides. In the rear, the dual exhaust took center stage under the bumper. Inside, MINI received a 5"" instrument cluster fitted as standard. An 8.8"" touch-screen dominated the top of the center stack. The dashboard's front panel sported a carbon-fiber trim. Its front sport-bucket seats featured high-bolstering. Its five-doors configuration allowed a better ingress and egress from the car, while the rear bench seatback was split-folding. Under the hood, MINI installed a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine with TwinPower technology that reduced the lag and rocketed the car to 100 kph (62 mph) in a mere 6.9 seconds (6.7s for the automatic transmission).",MINI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""MINI Cooper S"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""mini"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""practical"", ""striking"", ""punchy"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""striking"", ""piano-black""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""dual"", ""under""],    ""wheel"": [""18-inch"", ""two-tone""],    ""doors"": [""five-door"", ""better ingress/egress""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual""]  }}```"
MINI Clubvan,"The 2012 MINI Clubvan was one of the rarest MINI ever made. It was designed for those who needed a van but in a more exquisite form. It might be called a “premium, small-class, utility van”. The Clubvan was unveiled as a Concept Car at 2012 Geneva Motor Show and the pre-series model showed up at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in the same year. Production models started in late 2012 and further models were produced in 2013. After only 50 models have been sold in the U.S., the car was axed from the production line. The Clubvan was a Clubman with vinyl wraps over its side windows and plastic covers inside to protect the glass for breaking. It was the cheapest production method for the Clubvan, a vehicle that was actually a converted Clubman. It even kept the side rear small door, but it was useless. It was there just to ease the production line. Moreover, the interior rear grab-handles, which were useful for rear passengers, were kept in place. The front seats retained the folding mechanism that was used to allow access for the rear seats. The instrument cluster and the dashboard were the same as in any other MINI Clubman. The car was ideal especially for MINI service-shops and for luxury deliveries since its price was particularly high. Back in the '50s, an economic debate between Europe and the U.S. led to an increase in taxation for the chickens imported in Europe from the U.S. In retaliation, the U.S. Government imposed a 25% tax for imported utility vans and pickups from Europe. That law was still in existence in 2013 and thus, the MINI Clubvan was more expensive than a MINI Clubman, and from most of the vans.",MINI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""MINI Clubvan"",  ""year"": ""2012"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""exquisite"", ""utility"", ""converted"", ""luxury""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""rear small door""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MITSUBISHI ASX / RVR / Outlander Sport,"Mitsubishi introduced the second generation of the ASX in 2023, a badge-engineered version of the French Renault Captur, thus lowering the R&D costs. After the marriage between Renault and Mitsubishi, the Japanese brand was in danger of being expelled from the European market. But the new owner thought differently. After all, if Volkswagen Group sold, basically, the same Golf under three different badges (SEAT, Skoda, and VW), Renault could do the same. The automaker's only problem was that its expertise in badge engineering was small. While the Germans had created different bodyworks, the French group just ripped off the rhomboidal badges and installed the three-diamond one in place. At the front, the small-sized crossover featured the same headlights as the Renault Captur, with its C-shaped LED daytime running lights. In the middle of the black grille, the carmaker placed the three-diamond badge supported on the rhomboidal plastic part that was pressed for Renault. On its sides, depending on the version and options, the ASX sported 18"" light-alloy wheels and chromed trims on the lower sides of the doors. Finally, at the back, the automaker installed Mitsubishi lettering on the tailgate, while the place for the former Renault badge was occupied by the reversing camera. It looked like an add-on aftermarket equipment, although it wasn't. Inside, the ASX featured the same bolstered front bucket seats carried over from Renault's parts bin, and the same went with the rear bench. In addition, the three-spoke steering wheel featured buttons on the horizontal spokes. Mitsubishi installed a digital screen inside the instrument cluster while atop the center stack boasted a 9.3"" infotainment touchscreen. The car was available with a small engine range, either gasoline, hybrid, and plug-in hybrid. The PHEV version was connected with a four-speed automatic gearbox for the ICE and a two-speed for the electric motor.",MITSUBISHI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""ASX"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""small-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""crossover"", ""sporty"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black"", ""rhomboidal"", ""plastic""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""C-shaped"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""18-inch"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [""chromed trims"", ""lower sides""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MITSUBISHI Outlander / Airtrek,"After joining the Renault-Nissan alliance, Mitsubishi received huge help from its former competitor and introduced the fourth generation of the Outlander in 2021. Mitsubishi was caught off-guard by the 2007 world financial crisis and, even though it survived, it couldn't make a new lineup that could save the brand. Most of its vehicles were old, and, apart from the L200 pickup and the Outlander, the rest of the rang struggled to survive on the market. After a few troubled years, Mitsubishi ended up in the Renault-Nissan alliance, and the first new product developed together was the Outlander. It was a new design language for Mitsubishi. The Outlander featured LED lights on top of the front fascia, with squared LED headlights mounted on the sides, above the bumper. Its broad, shield-like, chromed grille with three slats on the upper side and a black squared area were unusual for the Japanese brand. From its sides, the blacked-out B-pillar and the D-pillar shape gave the impression of a floating roof. Mitsubishi kept the split tailgate system that made it famous in the compact SUV segment. While the exterior was flashy and daring but not luxurious, the interior was a different story. Depending on the trim level, the Outlander featured cloth or leather seats and a premium interior feeling. Its gear selector was small and placed on top of a tall center console. A large display filled the instrument cluster while an additional touch-screen made it on top of the dashboard, above the center stack. Like its predecessors, the Outlander's fourth-generation provided room for seven people, with two folding seats in the trunk. At the launch, the Outlander was available exclusively with a newly developed 2.5-liter gasoline engine paired to a CVT that sent the power in all four corners.",MITSUBISHI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Outlander"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""flashy"", ""daring"", ""unusual"", ""premium"", ""spacious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""broad""],    ""grille"": [""shield-like"", ""chromed"", ""squared""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""squared""],    ""bumper"": [""front""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""black"", ""blacked-out""],    ""roof"": [""floating""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MITSUBISHI Eclipse Cross,"To revive its sales, Mitsubishi revived the glorious name Eclipse and added it to a cross-over, a mix between an SUV and a four-door coupe. Mitsubishi gave great cars to the world in the past times, from the fuel-efficient Colt to the powerful 3000 GT. At the same time, it proved that it was the weapon of choice to win the grueling Paris-Dakar rally-raid, a tough competition which it won 12 times. Models such as the Pajero/Montero, L200 pickup, or the Outlander made a good impression on the market as well. The 2021 Eclipse Cross featured a new design with a completely different front fascia. The designers put the daytime running lights where the headlights were on the previous model and installed the driving lights in the bumper. They redesigned the grille as well. In the back, the windscreen from the tailgate was taller to improve visibility. Inside, the 2021 Eclipse Cross featured a light interior update. On top of the center stack, an 8"" touch-screen display for the infotainment system was installed. The instrument cluster featured the same information as before, with a mix of analog and digital dials. Under the hood, a 1.5-liter gasoline engine was available from the start. It offered 150 hp, and it was paired to a CVT that sent the torque in all corners via an all-wheel-drive Haldex system. A plug-in hybrid was announced.",MITSUBISHI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Eclipse Cross"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""crossover"", ""SUV"", ""four-door coupe"", ""fuel-efficient"", ""powerful""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""taller for improved visibility""],    ""grille"": [""redesigned""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""relocated daytime running lights""],    ""bumper"": [""installed driving lights""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MITSUBISHI Mirage,"The small-class vehicle has been around since 1978, when the first generation was introduced to the market. In 2012, the Japanese manufacturer unveiled the sixth generation, which was refreshed for the 2020 model. For Mitsubishi, the sales were not so well, and by 2020 it began part of the Renault-Nissan Alliance, and it started to share some parts. But the Mirage was still a Mitsubishi product. The small-class vehicle, with its rounded edges, was a direct competitor against the Renault Clio and Nissan Micra. But it still had some design cues that made it pleasant on the market. From the outside, the 2020 model received a new front fascia with redesigned headlights and new daytime running lights, available with LED technology. The front bumper was redesigned and made larger to improve pedestrian protection. As a consequence, the grille had to be reshaped. The rear received a wider look and a more significant presence thanks to the squared-off treatment of the bumper corners and new LED combination taillights. There was also a new design for the 15” light-alloy wheels as well. Inside, the car received a 6.5” touch-screen display for the infotainment system, and it was able to connect to smartphones via Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. On top of that, a sat-nav system was available. Even for the base models, the Bluetooth connectivity was fitted as standard. The air-conditioning system, front power windows, and leather-wrapped steering wheel were on the offer. Under the hood, the engineers trusted the already proven 1.2-liter, 80 hp gasoline engine. It was the only option available, and it was paired as standard to a 5-speed manual gearbox. The continuously variable transmission (CVT) was on the options list.",MITSUBISHI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mitsubishi Mirage"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""rounded edges"", ""pleasant design cues"", ""wider rear look"", ""significant presence"", ""15” light-alloy wheels""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""reshaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""redesigned"", ""available with LED technology""],    ""bumper"": [""larger"", ""redesigned"", ""squared-off treatment""],    ""wheel"": [""15” light-alloy"", ""new design""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MITSUBISHI Mirage G4,"Once a simple hatchback in the small-segment, the Mitsubishi Mirage evolved into a different vehicle over the years. Mitsubishi faced some financial troubles, but it had to introduce new cars on the market. Its aged L200 Pickup and Outlander were, basically, the only vehicles that could sustain the brand on the market. The Lancer was already old, and so was the Pajero/Montero. It tried with the Space Star, which was mostly a rebadged Colt, but its success was limited. Then, in 2013, it introduced the four-door sedan Mirage based on the same platform as the Space Star. It was designed especially for the emerging markets, but it was also available on the North-American continent. The carmaker tried to offer an aerodynamically efficient vehicle with the Space Star and obtained a 0.27 drag coefficient. When it transformed the vehicle into a four-door sedan, that advantage went down the drain, but it was still good for the car's size. But customers didn't see that. They saw a vehicle with a grille too high, two ascending lines on the sides, and a sloped rear end. Inside, Mitsubishi installed a rounded dashboard with a piano-black center stack. They looked good in some pictures, but it was hard to hide the low-quality materials used. A big infotainment system with a touch-screen display was available on the upper trim levels. In the spirit of its glorious motorsport heritage, Mitsubishi installed an instrument cluster where it displayed only a tachometer and a speedometer. Despite having room for four adults inside, the short wheelbase led to limited legroom for the rear passengers. The Mirage featured a 1.2-liter gasoline engine paired to a five-speed manual or to a CVT gearbox. There was no other option for it.",MITSUBISHI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mitsubishi Mirage"",  ""year"": ""2013"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""aerodynamic"", ""efficient"", ""four-door sedan"", ""sloped rear end"", ""rounded dashboard""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""grille"": [""high""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""small""],    ""doors"": [""four-door""],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MITSUBISHI Lancer,"After almost a decade since its first appearance on the market, the Lancer received a final facelift before it was completely changed in 2017. When Mitsubishi introduced the Lancer in 2007, nobody thought that the carmaker would keep it into production for such a long time. But the struggling Japanese carmaker couldn't afford to change it. Its finances were hit hard during the world financial crisis, and its products were already old and difficult to sell. The Lancer was supposed to save the brand, but it just couldn't do it by itself. For 2016, the Mitsubishi designers reshaped the front bumper and made it bigger, and included the LED daytime running lights on the outer side-pods. Unlike many other carmakers, they didn't install LED headlights since they were too expensive to implement. On its sides, the Lancer featured a new set of side-skirts. Inside, the carmaker kept the same spartan look of the interior, but it installed an updated touchscreen infotainment system on top of the center stack. The binocular-style instrument cluster remained the same as before, with a TFT display between the tachometer and speedometer. For the sedan version, the Lancer featured a fixed, split-folding rear bench seatback. Under the hood, the base version featured a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter engine that provided 148 hp. The other engine option was a 2.4-liter naturally aspirated unit that provided 20 ponies more. Both versions were paired as standard to a 5-speed manual while a CVT was on the options list.",MITSUBISHI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Lancer"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""spartan interior"", ""facelifted front bumper"", ""new side-skirts"", ""updated touchscreen infotainment system"", ""binocular-style instrument cluster""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""bigger""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED daytime running lights""],    ""bumper"": [""reshaped"", ""bigger""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MITSUBISHI Colt 5 Doors,"The new 2024 Mitsubishi Colt marks the seventh generation of the well-known car sold in Europe by the Japanese automaker. In almost 45 years of its existence in the European market, the Colt was produced and sold in approximately 1.2 million units. Even though Colt was a familiar name in the motorsport world for decades, as it was a competitive rally car, the present variant of the Colt leans more towards efficiency in urban driving and offering good value for the money. The company develops the vehicle on the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance CMF-B platform and will be manufactured at Renault's Bursa plant in Turkey. It is set to arrive in Mitsubishi Motors' European showrooms in the last quarter of 2023. With its reintroduction, the car marks the first Colt to enter the European market after a nine-year pause. Design-wise, the all-new Colt boasts a dynamic and sporty appearance that perfectly suits European cities. Its front face reflects the Mitsubishi Motors Dynamic Shield design concept, featuring sleek, full LED headlights on the upper portion and L-shaped LED daytime running lights below for a sharp expression. At the rear, the widened bumper adds agility and stability to the overall look. The athletic look combined with a color like bright red can put the small car in good light, as it seems quick enough to navigate the city traffic easily. Regarding powertrain options, the Mitsubishi Colt offers an environmentally friendly full hybrid (HEV) model and a gasoline engine model. The HEV model combines a 1.6-liter gasoline engine, two electric motors, a principal and an auxiliary one, an automatic multi-mode gearbox, and a 1.2 kWh battery. On the other hand, the gasoline model presents a choice between a 1.0-liter turbocharged gasoline engine with a 6-speed manual transmission or a 1.0-liter gasoline engine with a 5-speed manual transmission. For comfort and safety, the premium interior of the Colt is equipped with Smartphone-link Display Audio (SDA) centrally positioned on the instrument panel. With a 7-inch or 9.3-inch display, the driver gains access to the Multi-Sense system, enabling personalized driving experiences through drive modes (My Sense, Sport, or Eco mode), engine and steering response adjustments, and ambient lighting control. Additionally, the Bose premium sound system enhances the driving experience with immersive audio. Advanced safety features are also incorporated, providing assistance and ensuring a safe and secure driving experience for the driver. If you're looking for a  daily driver, the 2024 Mitsubishi Colt may be the best option as it represents one of the most complete packages from the compact car market. The vehicle's reduced dimensions and hybrid powertrain make it the best bang for a buck in the market, not only for its features but also for its efficiency.",MITSUBISHI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mitsubishi Colt"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""dynamic"", ""sporty"", ""athletic"", ""agile"", ""compact""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sleek""],    ""grille"": [""dynamic"", ""sporty""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""full LED"", ""sharp""],    ""bumper"": [""widened"", ""agile"", ""stable""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MITSUBISHI Lancer Hatchback,"After the successful introduction of the 2007 Lancer generation, Mitsubishi tried its luck with a hatchback version unveiled in 2008. Finally, the Japanese carmaker could use the Lancer nameplate globally. Before the 2007 version, it had to use Carisma on the European market, where it was a very appreciated car, but the name was not the one expected by its fans. Since the car was not available as a station wagon, the Japanese carmaker introduced a hatchback named Sportback. It featured the same fresh look with a prominent trapezoidal grille and two angular headlights. Mitsubishi's designers extended the sharp lines on the sides over the bodywork. In the rear, behind the rear, doors, Mitsubishi's designers made a different C-pillar with a sloped liftgate in the back. They also redesigned the taillights. Inside, the dashboard was clean with two-round clusters on the dashboard. Depending on the option, an infotainment system with Bluetooth connectivity, a navigation system, and a USB aux was available. In the back, the carmaker installed a 60/40 split-folding rear bench which increased the trunk size from 344 liters (15.14 cu-ft) to 1,349 liters (47.64 cu-ft) The Lancer was available with various engines, starting with a 110 hp 1.5-liter naturally aspirated engine. Another 1.8-liter was available. Since the European customers asked for diesel engines, Mitsubishi installed a VW-supplied 2.0-liter TDI unit. On top of that, Mitsubishi offered a special version named Ralliart, which was a de-tuned Lancer Evolution with an all-wheel-drive and automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox.",MITSUBISHI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Lancer"",  ""year"": ""2008"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""fresh look"", ""sharp lines"", ""clean dashboard""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""prominent trapezoidal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angular""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sharp lines""],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MITSUBISHI Pajero 5 Doors,"Mitsubishi was the most notorious competitor in the harsh Paris-Dakar Rallye-raid, which it won 12 times with the Pajero. The street version also won a reputation for reliability. The Pajero, which was also known as Montero in Spain and other Spanish-speaking countries, or Shogun in the U.K. started its journey in 1981 with the first generation. It was a body-on-frame construction. The third generation was introduced in 1999 with revolutionary unibody construction and an integrated ladder frame chassis. That construction type was carried over to the fourth generation, which was launched in 2006 at the Paris Motor Show. The flared wheel arches and the sloped roofline were unusual for a true off-road vehicle. A three-slat chromed grille was introduced and bigger, taller headlights were installed. It was offered in a 3-, and 5-door version. The former was offered as a 5-seat only and the later was fitted with 7 seats. The spare-wheel was kept on the rear trunk door. Inside, the Pajero featured a newly designed dashboard, with a big instrument cluster. The center stack hosted the infotainment unit and an additional LCD for the on-board computer. There was plenty of room for three adult passengers on the middle row and limited for the third. The technical platform was the one that brought the Pajero under spotlights. It was the only 4x4 vehicle in the world that featured a 4x4 on-demand system which could have been driven as an all-wheel-drive vehicle since it was fitted with three differentials. The central and the rear one could have been locked for better traction. For the engine bay, the manufacturer installed either a 3.2-liter turbocharged diesel or 3.8-liter gasoline. Both versions were mated as standard with a 5-speed manual, while a 5-speed automatic was available as an option.",MITSUBISHI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mitsubishi Pajero"",  ""year"": ""2006"",  ""size"": ""Full-size SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""reliable"", ""rugged"", ""spacious"", ""innovative"", ""distinctive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""three-slat"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [""flared""],    ""headlights"": [""bigger"", ""taller""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""flared""],    ""doors"": [""5-door"", ""7-seat""],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""rear-mounted""]  }}```"
MITSUBISHI Lancer Evolution,"Even though the Japanese automaker was no longer a significant contender in the World Rally Championship, that didn't stop it from creating a race-oriented sedan for the masses. The Lancer Evolution name was forged on rally stages and constantly evolved from a small-sized sedan to a compact-sized vehicle that was too big to fit on narrow, snow or gravel-covered roads. Yet, the Evolution X, or Evo X, still featured technical improvements that made it a perfect choice for those looking for an amazingly fast vehicle but priced as a mundane sedan. Finally, the Evo X looked race-ready but not like a vehicle tuned in an underground tuner, but in a carmaker specialty shop. Even though the hood's vents and the trunk lid wing looked more like a boy racer's dream, these were functional. In addition, the air dam at the front lets bystanders admire the intercooler hidden behind the mesh grille. From its profile, the enlarged front and rear wheel fenders were unique for this top-spec version of the thee-box sedan Lancer. Inside, the overall look was similar to the rest of the Lancer range. Yet, the front sports seats and the driver-oriented dashboard created a racy ambiance inside the vehicle. Still, it was a decent vehicle that could do school runs. Last but not least, Mitsubishi installed only the best fabric it had in its basket. Under the hood was the same glorious 4G63 turbocharged powerplant. It provided 291 hp (295 PS) and sent its twisting force in all corners via a six-speed manual gearbox.",MITSUBISHI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Lancer Evolution"",  ""year"": ""Evo X"",  ""size"": ""compact-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""race-oriented"", ""fast"", ""functional"", ""racy"", ""unique""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""mesh""],    ""hood"": [""vented""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""air dam""],    ""wheel"": [""enlarged front and rear fenders""],    ""doors"": [""sports seats""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""trunk lid wing""],    ""exhaust"": [""glorious""]  }}```"
MITSUBISHI Space Star,"Somewhere on the road, Mitsubishi lost its appetite for good looking cars and started to recycle old names for new cars that didn't have anything in common with the previous models. A good example was the Mitsubishi Space Star. The previous generation of Space Star was a compact MPV based on the same platform as the European version of the Mitsubishi Lancer, named Carisma. It was the MPV with a sedan handling. In other markets, the 2013 Space Star was named Mirage. Unlike its Mirage predecessors, it wasn't offered as a coupe. The 2013 Space Star was the replacement of the Mitsubishi Colt. A car that was built for the supermini segment in Europe. But unlike the Colt, the Space Star featured a bland design. The first facelift was launched in 2015 and only then the car started to pick-up in sales. Its low price and economic engines were its main advantages on the market Inside, the Space Star/Mirage offered room for five passengers, but smaller sized for the rear seats. In the front, the higher seating position was appealing for those who use to drive with their seats lifted as much as possible. The instrument cluster featured a design that can bring back memories from the '90s cars. For the engines, the Space Star/Mirage installed economical units with 1.0-liter or 1.2-liter gasoline engines. The standard transmission for the 1.0-liter was a 5-speed manual or a CVT for the later version.",MITSUBISHI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mitsubishi Space Star"",  ""year"": ""2013"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""bland"", ""economical"", ""compact"", ""sedan-like""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""standard""],    ""grille"": [""bland""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""standard""],    ""bumper"": [""standard""],    ""wheel"": [""small""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""compact""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""standard""]  }}```"
MITSUBISHI Pajero 3 Doors,"The fourth generation of the Pajero/Montero/Shogun broke its chains and stormed the Mitsubishi Motors booth at the 2006 Paris Motor Show. Depending on the market, the biggest Mitsubishi off-road-er wore the Montero/Pajero/Shogun name. While it wasn't a revolution over its predecessor, it was a clear evolution that brought the car closer to its customers. Its only drawback on the European market was it's over three-liter engines led to higher taxes, leading to slow sales. The flared wheel arches and the sloped roofline were unusual for a proper off-road vehicle. Its flared wheel-arches created a muscular appearance for the Japanese off-road vehicle. In three-door shape, the rear side windows featured an ascending lower margin between the B- and the C-pillars. Like its predecessors, the Pajero's fourth-generation kept its spare wheel on the rear, side-hinged door. Inside, the Pajero featured a newly designed dashboard with a big instrument cluster. The center stack hosted the infotainment unit and an additional LCD for the onboard computer. At the front, Mitsubishi offered enough room for two occupants, but there was little room in the back, even for two passengers.

MITSUBISHI Pajero Pinin / Shogun Pinin / Montero iO,"The evolution of the compact-sized SUVs made Mitsubishi build one and launched it in 1998 in a three-door version, but realized its mistake and offered it five doors from 2001. Despite being one of the best offroad carmakers in the world, Mitsubishi didn't look too close to what Honda, Toyota, or Subaru did and started too late in the compact-SUV segment. Since the Japanese design didn't always fit the European tastes, it hired Pininfarina to build the car and even named it Pajero/Montero/Shogun Pinin, depending on the market. It had to look like a tough offroad car, but its size didn't help it. Its vertical side panels were good while going on the tracks but didn't look that well for a street vehicle. At least, it didn't look like a high-lifted station wagon like the Subaru Forester. Its squared headlights resembled those installed in the Pajero/Montero/Shogun. The steep windshield and vertical side windows formed a squared greenhouse. At least it featured a third window behind the rear doors. To emphasize the offroad look of the car, Mitsubishi installed the spare wheel on the rear, side-hinged door. The interior didn't look like Pininfarina made it. The boxy design with flat panels looked similar to those from other off-road vehicles built by Mitsubishi. Since the car was narrow, there was limited hip and shoulder room for three adults in the back and, despite the added longer wheelbase than the three-door version, it still didn't provide enough legroom for full-grown adults. From the offroad point of view, the Pinin was far more capable than its direct competitors. Mitsubishi didn't cut corners and provided the car with a capable 4x4 system, including a low-range transfer box.

MITSUBISHI i-MiEV,"It was a shy entrance into the electric car era for Mitsubishi and the Japanese carmaker couldn't have made it on its own. Mitsubishi went for an alliance with the French manufacturer PSA (Peugeot-Citroen). Thus, the triplets of i-Miev-iOn-C-Zero appeared on the market. All three models were the same vehicle with different badges. The base vehicle was the Japanese Mitsubishi i, which was sold in Japan as a Kei car with an internal combustion engine. Mitsubishi changed the engine with an electric motor, threw the fuel tank away and installed a battery pack. This is how the i-MIEV was born. Launched right in the middle of the world economic crisis, the i-MIEV didn't have much success. The world was not ready for the electric car revolution back then and the model's price was sky-high for a tiny, 3.47 m (11.4 ft) long vehicle. Inside the egg-shaped vehicle was enough room for four people and a trunk large enough to squeeze a six-pack. For that time, the biggest advantage for the i-MIEV were the running costs. The vehicle could be fully charged from a regular wall outlet. The 12.5 kWh battery too about 5 long hours to charge from 0 to 100 percent. The electric motor developed 49 kW and could pull the car up to a top speed of 130 kph. It used a single-speed transmission to get along and more programs for driving plus a B-mode, which the driver could use for powerful regenerative braking.",MITSUBISHI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""i-MIEV"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""3.47 m (11.4 ft) long"",  ""overall-design"": [""shy entrance"", ""egg-shaped"", ""tiny"", ""electric""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""roomy""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MITSUBISHI Attrage,"Basically a Mitsubishi Mirage with a trunk, the Attrage was an affordable small 4-door sedan. A new played in the B-segment market, the Attrage was the first eco-sedan from Mitsubishi. While it didn’t have the most exciting exterior design, the Attrage had a pleasant look with a big chrome grille and classy chrome accents on the sides of the front bumper. Powered by the same 1.2-liter 3-cylinder MIVEC engine that was mounted on the Mirage, the Attrage had 79 hp. It might sound a little underpowered, but the Attrage was a lightweight 900 kg vehicle and the MIVEC unit offered good torque at all times. As a result, the fuel consumption was extremely reduced to around 4.6 L/100 km. Inside, the cabin was fitted with hard plastics, however, everything looked well put together and the gloss finishes added a bit of style to the rather dull interior. The controls were easy to use and intuitively placed, but looked rather dated for 2013. Great room was offered to the rear occupants, with plenty of legroom and headroom. An armrest was also available in the rear cabin. Mated with the optional CVT transmission, the Attrage drove smoothly, mostly around town. On open roads, the noise of the engine could have been a little disturbing. The Attrage was designed for daily city driving and had an attractive price, thus it was a real success.",MITSUBISHI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mitsubishi Attrage"",  ""year"": ""2013"",  ""size"": ""small 4-door sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""affordable"", ""pleasant"", ""classy"", ""lightweight"", ""attractive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""big"", ""chrome""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""front"", ""chrome""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MORGAN Plus Six,"Creating a car that looks old and classic but with modern underpinning became one of Morgan's specialties, and its cars evolution continued in 2022. The British car manufacturer Morgan does not boast hundreds of thousands in sales every year. In its entire 112 years history, this brand produced fewer vehicles than other automakers in just twelve months. But Morgan was focused on creating cars that featured a classic design inspired by '30s and '40s vehicles but fitted with modern drivetrains and technologies. Morgan tried to differentiate the Plus Six from its smaller sibling, the Plus Four. Thus, the first noticeable difference was at the front, where the Six got two additional headlamps mounted lower, flanking the curved and tilted grille. From its profile, the valanced front fenders hosted a new set of light alloy wheels. It wasn't revolutionary at all compared to its predecessors, but despite looking similar, it was different. Another upgrade was for the folding roof that could have been easily folded back behind the cabin. Moreover, it featured a new lining that provided better sound and thermal insulation. The cabin boasted a hand-crafted leather-wrapped interior with bolstered seats. Unlike its predecessors, the 2022 Morgan Plus Six featured a digital display placed in front of the driver. As usual for a Morgan, the speedometer and tachometer were mounted atop the center stack, flanking an analog clock. A few buttons mounted underneath controlled the HVAC. Another important feature was the addition of a locking compartment placed behind the seats. For the sound system, Morgan worked together with a Sennheiser sound specialist and managed to install speakers in the door cards. For the drivetrain, Morgan worked together with BMW to develop the engine and transmission unit. It consisted of the famous twin-turbocharged inline-six paired with an eight-speed automatic gearbox.",MORGAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Plus Six"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""classic"", ""modern"", ""curved"", ""tilted"", ""hand-crafted""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""curved"", ""tilted""],    ""hood"": [""valanced""],    ""headlights"": [""additional"", ""lower""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""light alloy""],    ""doors"": [""folding"", ""hand-crafted""],    ""roof"": [""folding"", ""insulated""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MORGAN Plus 4,"Morgan introduced a new model lineup for the 2022 model year with the Plus Six and Plus Four and managed to continue its 112 years of legacy as a British car manufacturer. While some automakers bragged about their annual sales, Morgan took pride in itself as the oldest British brand still owned by a British company. Yet, it needed support from other carmakers to make new models. While it worked closely with Ford in the past, later models were powered by BMW engines and German ZF gearboxes. With the Plus Four model, Morgan tried to offer a lower-powered car than the Plus Six. It was also less expensive, but the overall design was similar to its sibling. Unlike the Plus Six, the Plus Four featured just two headlights mounted on the front fenders. Instead, the car's timeless look featured a curved grille with vertical slats followed by a slightly ascending hood toward the flat, tilted windshield. The valanced, long front fenders were followed by side sills, extended all the way to the rear, slimmer quarter panels. Inside, the cabin boasted bolstered seats and premium materials. In addition, the 2022 model boasted a Sennheiser sound system with speakers incorporated inside the door cards. Morgan used the old and effective grab-handles solution to close the tiny doors. The steering wheel looked very similar to the ones installed in MINI vehicles, a brand owned by BMW. A novelty for the car manufacturer was introducing a color display in front of the driver in the instrument panel. Two additional dials for the speedometer and tachometer were mounted on the dashboard above the center stack. Under the hood, Morgan installed a turbocharged inline-four carried over from BMW. Power went to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual.",MORGAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Plus Four"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""timeless"", ""curved"", ""slimmer"", ""premium"", ""effective""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""flat"", ""tilted""],    ""grille"": [""curved"", ""vertical""],    ""hood"": [""ascending""],    ""headlights"": [""two"", ""front-mounted""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""tiny""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MORGAN Aero 8,"Mostly handcrafted and brilliantly engineered, the 2015 Morgan Aero 8 made its global debut at the Geneva Motor Show that year, boasting a revised look and better underpinnings. The British car manufacturer had a long past of producing roadsters and sports cars mainly based on wooden chassis. But that was changed in 2000 when it introduced the Aero 8, which was a milestone in the company's history. With some engineering upgrades carried over from BMW, it brought the carmaker into modern times with an aluminum chassis and punchy V8 engines. And then, 15 years later, the fifth generation of the car came on stage. Many people made fun of the 2000 Aero 8 due to its headlights carried over from MINI and mounted in not the best possible way. But that changed with the 2015 model. On this model, they didn't look that weird, like they were squinting. In addition, the front grille with its vertical slats was slightly taller and wider. While the overall changes looked like they were from a contest to “spot the differences,” the car was new. On the sides, the automaker installed reshaped vents on the wide fenders, placed them low behind the wheel arches, and rearward tilted instead of vertical. At the back, the boat-tail design sported a clamshell for the trunk's lid, which opened rearward. In addition, as a result, the LED taillights were also different, with vertical lines on the quarter panels and a set of round lamps on the rear fascia, placed lower. Inside, the 2015 Aero 8 welcomed its customers with updated technologies, and a touchscreen infotainment system became available as an option. On the center stack, the automaker kept the same rugged-looking switches while. But an elegant roadster wouldn't be called like that if it wouldn't boast a luxurious leather-wrapped cabin with diamond stitching and real wooden trims. Under the hood, Morgan relied on BMW's drivetrains, although tuned for the British roadster. The 4.8-liter pumped-out 367 PS (362 hp) from its naturally aspirated V8 that were sent to the rear wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission and a limited-slip differential.",MORGAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Morgan Aero 8"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""roadster"",  ""overall-design"": [""handcrafted"", ""brilliantly engineered"", ""revised look"", ""luxurious"", ""elegant""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""taller"", ""wider"", ""vertical slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""revised"", ""not weird"", ""not squinting""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""wide fenders"", ""reshaped vents"", ""low placement"", ""rearward tilted""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""boat-tail design"", ""clamshell trunk lid"", ""rearward opening""],  }}```"
MORGAN 3 wheeler,"The British company produced the 3 wheelers between 1910 and 1952 and their present for the 100th years anniversary was a new 3 wheeler that came to life in 2011, launched at the Geneva Motor Show. The new Morgan was powered by a V-Twin bike engine that was mated to a Mazda 5-speed manual gearbox. The 115 hp developed by the S&S motor was transmitted to the rear wheel. And how does 4.5 seconds sound for a 0-100 sprint? More like the BMW’s M3 performance. The lightweight materials used to produce the Morgan made a total of less than 500 kg. The 3 Wheeler didn’t have a roof and was basically a tubular frame with two rollover bars around the 2-seater comportment. The open seat cabin revealed black seats wrapped in soft leather and simple cluster gauges. The cabin was designed to look like a plane’s cockpit, with the aluminum toggle switches. The classic Morgan lacked power steering and had no traction control. From inside the cabin, the driver and passenger could see the front wheels and feel the heat of the exposed exhaust. The trike featured a green paint job, similar to the British Spitfire interceptor plane and it also included the RAF roundel symbol. The sound of the engine was rather powerful and beautiful, roaring at over 3,000 rpm.",MORGAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Morgan 3 Wheeler"",  ""year"": ""2011"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""lightweight"", ""open"", ""classic"", ""aerodynamic"", ""powerful""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""tubular"", ""exposed""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""rear""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""exposed"", ""powerful"", ""beautiful""]  }}```"
MORGAN 4/4 2 Seater,"Its classic design, cozy cockpit, and good performance made the Morgan 4/4 a great companion for those who enjoyed the ride more than the destination. The first Morgan 4/4 was introduced in 1936 and was the most popular model built by the British car-maker. Due to the war, the production stopped and it was resumed in 1946, with an improved model that featured permanent window frames. In 2008, the Morgan 4/4 was under production for more than seven decades. It was the longest production model in the world. While the technologies and society evolved, the shape of the 4/4 remained similar to the one from 1955. With flared fenders in the front, a curved and grille with vertical slats and a long hood relatively to the car. The flat windshield was still the same. The side, removable windows, were new. The interior featured two seats and leather upholstery. The entire cabin was finished with leather as well. The dashboard was flat and the dials were mounted in the middle. Thus, it was easier for the factory to built left- or right-hand drive vehicles. There was no air-conditioning or power windows. The fabric roof was manually folded. Over time, Morgan mostly worked with Ford for the engines. The 2008 model was fitted with a 1.6-liter engine from the big car-maker. It started the production with a Ford gearbox, but soon it was replaced by a Mazda MX5 5-speed gearbox.",MORGAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Morgan 4/4"",  ""year"": ""2008"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""classic"", ""cozy"", ""timeless"", ""elegant"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""flat""],    ""grille"": [""curved"", ""with vertical slats""],    ""hood"": [""long""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""removable""],    ""roof"": [""fabric, manually folded""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
MORGAN Plus 8,"A classic look, a powerful V8, and a steering wheel attached to a bare-bone car with a classic look. That was the 2012 Morgan Plus 8, a roadster that didn't have competition. The Morgan Plus 8 was an evolution of the Morgan Plus 4. In 1968 a V8 version appeared with a Rover engine that was purchased from GM in 1967. It was installed on a wooden chassis. In 2012, that couldn't work well. So, the 2012 Morgan Plus 8 had an aluminum chassis, a BMW V8 engine, and an optional Steptronic, 6-speed automatic transmission. The car was not for those who were looking for a state-of-the-art new vehicle with 100 nannies under the skin to help them run into a straight line. It was a car that showed the world the true meaning of ""timeless design"" expression. With its long hood and flared, ample, fenders, it defied the design trends in the way that a tuxedo defied the denim jeans. There was no trunk in the Plus 8. Only a storage compartment behind the seats where some could fit a handkerchief. In the cockpit, there were the bare necessities: two bucket-seats, a steering wheel with airbag, and two large dials on the dashboard. The audio system was provided by Alpine. It was the highest quality sound system someone would buy in a car that wasn't meant to drive with the radio on. The hand-built aluminum bodywork was feather-light. Its 1100 kg. (2425 lbs) unladen weight made the Morgan Plus 8 the world's lightest V8 car in the world. Under the timeless design, there were new Brembo brakes and fully independent suspension. And no, it didn't have any traction control. It featured ABS and that was it.",MORGAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Morgan Plus 8"",  ""year"": ""2012"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""timeless"", ""classic"", ""powerful"", ""flared"", ""ample""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""long""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""bare-bone""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""hand-built""]  }}```"
MORGAN Aero Coupe,"Morgan was one of the last British car manufacturers still standing. For most of its history, it produced cars based on ash wood chassis and open tops. But the 2012 Aero Coupe was a completely new chapter in the carmaker's book. There were new regulations regarding people's safety onboard vehicles that Morgan couldn't surpass. Moreover, to access specific markets, it had to have vehicles built on anything else suitable than wood. While there were discussions about using carbon fiber or Kevlar, the final decision favored aluminum. And that formed the base for the 2012 Aero Coupe. After building roadsters for more than seven decades, Morgan announced the closed-top version of the Aero 8 in 2012 at the Geneva Motor Show. The vehicle was a delightful mix of old-school craftsmanship and new-edge technology. Moreover, the powerplant was modern, and the lightweight construction allowed the vehicle to threaten famous other European GT vehicles. Still, since the car was hand-assembled from zero, the car manufacturer was unable to produce the Aero Coupe in large quantities. The vehicle's design combined the curved, ample lines of the British roadsters from the '30s and '40s with new technologies, such as the headlights that were carried over from Mini. In order to look great from the front, the headlamps had to be mounted on the inner side of the large fenders, towards the V-shaped engine compartment, and the result was not the most pleasant in the industry. From its profile, the automaker installed a set of vents behind the front wheel arches followed by the side sills, which incorporated the exhausts. At the back, the rear fenders were also wider than the rest of the bodywork, creating a muscular appearance for the Aero Coupe. Unlike most of its siblings, the car featured a closed cabin with a raked windshield, and a curved roof sloped down towards the end of the vehicle. At the back, Morgan installed slim and tall taillights that followed the rear quarter panels' edge. To pass the safety tests but still keep the car's beauty, the automaker concealed the bumper behind the rear fascia. Inside, Morgan installed a flat dash panel with two large dials in front of the driver flanked by two gauges. The high-bolstered sports seats at the front were separated by a tall center console, which housed the gear selector and the hand brake. For a modern approach, the leather-wrapped cabin was adorned with several chromed trims around the dials, buttons, and door handles. Morgan installed a powerful V8 engine supplied by BMW together with the gearbox. As a result, the British automaker didn't have to worry about emission tests. Since it made the Aero Coupe for enthusiasts, it paired the engine with a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic that sent the power to the rear wheels.",MORGAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Aero Coupe"",  ""year"": ""2012"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""modern"", ""muscular"", ""curved"", ""sleek"", ""elegant""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""curved""],    ""headlights"": [""mounted on inner side of fenders""],    ""bumper"": [""concealed behind rear fascia""],    ""wheel"": [""large fenders"", ""vents behind front wheel arches""],    ""doors"": [""closed cabin""],    ""roof"": [""curved"", ""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""incorporated into side sills""]  }}```"
MORGAN Roadster,"Morgan was the oldest car manufacturer owned by a single-family in its entire history. And the word manufacturer suits best for it since all of their cars were built by hand. Morgan started its business in 1910, and the first car was a tricycle with a single seat. It launched the first four-wheeled car in 1936. In 1937 it introduced an extended version, with four seats. Over time, the car manufacturer offered 4-seat versions for its vehicles, but the main products were suitable only for two occupants. The 2006 model still had the same lines as the old models, but they never seemed outdated. Despite the extended, curved wheel arches and the narrow and tall engine compartment, they never looked old. A curved and tilted radiator grille with vertical slats was typical for most of the Morgan vehicles. Compared to the pre-War models, the big difference was the headlights, which were incorporated into the front fenders and not attached to a bar. The car's back was extended to accommodate another set of seats, and the trunk lid was almost vertical. Due to the extended cockpit, the carmaker installed a pair of seats in the back. For the 2006 model, these were placed lower. The exposed wooden part that ran from the front to the back of the cabin was a statement of preserving the original design, with wooden components for the chassis. Under the hood, Morgan was up to date with new engines and technologies. It featured a 3.7-liter V6 engine. It was paired to a 6-speed manual only.",MORGAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Morgan"",  ""year"": ""2006"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""hand-built"", ""timeless"", ""curved"", ""extended"", ""preserved""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""curved""],    ""grille"": [""tilted"", ""vertical""],    ""hood"": [""narrow"", ""tall""],    ""headlights"": [""incorporated""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""curved"", ""extended""],    ""doors"": [""extended""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""vertical""]  }}```"
NIO ES8,"NIO announced the ES8 SUV in 2017 and started production in June 2018, but it was only available in China, while the rest of the world still had to wait. The Chinese carmaker understood that if it wants to compete against other premium carmakers from Europe, it had to work with the best suppliers for various underpinnings. NIO did that and took the air-suspension from Continental and the brakes from Brembo. Also, it worked together with Tata Technologies for the powertrain. The seven-seat SUV showed a mature vehicle without the typical flaws in a new carmaker's design process. Since the SUVs were still in high demand on the market, NIO didn't want to start with cheap electric vehicles. It went straight for the top customers with an electric, seven-seat SUV that showed a big, trapezoidal front grille extended to the lower side of the apron. Its LED headlights stood above the side scoops, under the daytime running lights bars. Its profile showed widened front and rear fenders and sculptured door panels. It was still a conservative approach to the market, with a clear SUV shape. In the back, the taillights' wave-like pattern resembled those installed in a Renault Megane hatchback, but they fit well in the overall vehicle's design. The interior was filled with premium materials in most areas and showed great attention to detail. A wide center console separated the front occupants and featured storage areas and two big cupholders. On top of the dash, the Nomi AI assistant was there to help and entertain the driver. Like its other products, the NIO ES8 featured four electric motors, one in each wheel. It provided a total of 544 hp, and its replaceable battery pack came in three sizes.",NIO,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""ES8"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""seven-seat SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""mature"", ""premium"", ""conservative"", ""sculptured"", ""wide""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""big"", ""trapezoidal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""electric"", ""four motors""],    ""doors"": [""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NIO EP9,"When William Li launched the NIO brand in 2014, he promised a supercar that could compete against the most powerful vehicles on sale and kept his word. Before starting the NIO brand, William Li was the NIO 333 FE racing team owner in the FIA's Formula E. The engineers showed their skills when NIO started developing a supercar, and the EP9 was ready to roll after just 18 months of development. Introduced in 2016, the EP9 offered one-megawatt power. Its carbon-fiber bodywork and chassis helped the car obtaining an astonishing power-to-weight ratio of 784 hp/ton. Moreover, the car's active aerodynamic made the car corner faster. As a result, the EP9 lapped the Nurburgring track in 6m45.9, just a second slower than the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ. The flat and curved bodywork showed a long and curved cockpit, with a design inspired by a speedboat. Its designer, David Hilton, signed the projects for various cars, such as the Bentley GT3 racer or the Infiniti Emerg-E concept car. Inside the cockpit, the most shocking sight was the side head restraints that kept the occupants' heads fixed during high-speed cornering. The carmaker installed four screens in the cabin and not a single analog instrument. Its steering wheel was made by the same team that built the Formula E racing wheel. As for the seats, they offered the highest bolstering possible on the market. In addition to the four engines mounted in all corners, the EP9 offered adaptive suspension and a fully autonomous driving mode, which was not approved for road use. But it was used to establish a track record on the Circuit of Americas, where it was slower than a racing driver.",NIO,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""EP9"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""aerodynamic"", ""futuristic"", ""sleek"", ""high-performance""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""curved""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""flat""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""wheel"": [""carbon-fiber""],    ""doors"": [""curved""],    ""roof"": [""long""],    ""diffusor"": [""functional"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""spoiler"": [""high-performance""],    ""exhaust"": [""dual""]  }}```"
NIO EC6,"NIOEC6 entered the SUV-coupe niche-market and brought electric mobility to a segment where there were just a few options, and none was electric. After NIO started its journey in 2014 and introduced a new model faster than anyone thought of, basically, it developed one platform for its SUV range, expanded and shrunk it to allow five or seven passengers or to give it more power. Thus, it didn't take too long to create a new design for an existing model and introduced the EC6 in late 2019. The Chinese carmaker tried to create a signature front fascia and adapted it for its entire range. Its designers didn't have to work too much for the EC6 since they carried over all the elements from its ES8 sibling. The triangular-shaped headlights and the raked-forward front panel were followed by the curved bodywork with an arched roofline. NIO claimed that the EC6 sported the biggest panoramic roof in the SUV-coupe segment. The interior was fit for five adult passengers. Since there was no transmission tunnel, the flat floor allowed three passengers' good legroom in the back. The sloped back began behind the rear passengers, where the third row of seats was installed on the ES8. Between the front passengers, the carmaker installed a tall and wide center console with bucket-sized storage areas. Most of the center stack was covered by a touch-screen for the infotainment unit, with a few physical buttons. NIO offered the EC6 with a choice of two battery packs and two engines. Since the customers could rent the battery packs, they could choose their sizes and replace them according to their needs with a 70 kWh or a 100 kWh pack.",NIO,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""EC6"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""SUV-coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""triangular-shaped headlights"", ""raked-forward front panel"", ""curved bodywork"", ""arched roofline"", ""biggest panoramic roof""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""signature front fascia""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""triangular-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""fit for five adult passengers""],    ""roof"": [""biggest panoramic roof"", ""arched roofline""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NIO ES6,"NIO introduced the ES6 as a family SUV with up to five seats and a regular shape as the Chinese carmaker lineup's base model. After the preview of the stunning electric supercar offered by NIO, the carmaker turned its attention to regular customers and offered them an electric SUV that could fit in the same budget with a regular, internal combustion-engined, European premium SUV. Its performances and options were over the edge and proved that the Chinese recipe was good. The ES6 showed an aggressive styling with the angular look and some ideas seen on Hyundai's lineup. The carmaker installed the daytime running lights above the LED headlights. Its designers tried to make a different sculptured front fascia to conceal the lack of a regular grille. NIO chose not to install such an element since it was not needed. In the back, the taillights' wave-like pattern resembled those installed in a Renault Megane hatchback, but they fit well in the overall vehicle's design. The interior was fit for five adult passengers. Since there was no transmission tunnel, the flat floor allowed three passengers' good legroom in the back. Between the front passengers, the carmaker installed a tall and wide center console with bucket-sized storage areas. Most of the center stack was covered by a touch-screen for the infotainment unit, with a few physical buttons at the bottom. Since the ES6 was the access model for NIO, the carmaker tried to make it more affordable and offered it with two or four engines and two battery packs. Also, it provided the option to rent the batteries instead of buying them, reducing the car's price by 20%.",NIO,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""ES6"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""family SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive styling"", ""angular look"", ""sculptured front fascia"", ""wave-like pattern taillights"", ""fit for five adult passengers""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""regular shape""],    ""grille"": [""lack of regular grille""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED headlights"", ""daytime running lights above""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NIO ET7,"NIO introduced the ET7 as the electric-car with the longest range in the world and with enough performance to leave many sports cars behind with only the buzzing sound of electric motors. When William Li introduced the NIO brand back in 2014, he promised a different approach to its customers, and he tried to keep his promise. His next promise was the launch of the NIO brand in Europe by the end of 2021. NIO designed the ET7 as a four-door coupe fastback. Its aerodynamic shape and big batteries helped the car achieve a 1000 km (620 miles) range, which was more than any other electric car in the world at that time. At the front, the narrow line of the LED headlights stood above the front bumper. A set of air intakes in the apron and on the sides minimized the drag resistance. On top of the raked windshield, three cameras watched the road ahead and helped the autonomous driving system. Inside, the carmaker installed a comfortable lounge for five adult passengers and, above them, a panoramic glass roof offered more light for the cabin. As expected in this segment, the instrument panel was completely digital, and the same went with the infotainment unit. Thanks to the big wheelbase, the ET7 offered ample room for the rear seat occupants. NIO installed four electric motors on the car and offered a choice of three batteries, either for rent or for sale with the vehicle. Besides their ability to be charged at a dedicated plug, NIO offered the possibility to replace the drained battery with a fully charged one in less than ten minutes.",NIO,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""ET7"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""four-door coupe fastback"",  ""overall-design"": [""aerodynamic"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""spacious"", ""innovative""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""narrow"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""front""],    ""wheel"": [""big""],    ""doors"": [""four""],    ""roof"": [""panoramic glass""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Sentra,"The 2024 Nissan Sentra is a refreshed and updated version of the 2019 eighth-generation Sentra. As a facelift, it brings visual changes and new technologies to adapt the model to the constantly changing market. From its inception in 1982 until 1999, the Sentra was considered a subcompact car, but with the fifth generation, it became a compact-sized car. Throughout its history, the model had a lot of other names, depending on the market. The Japanese automaker sells the same vehicle in its domestic market under the name Sylphy. Three grades are available for the new model: S, SV, and SR. The available options are meant to offer a vehicle that suits better various customers' needs. The new Sentra is propelled by a fuel-efficient 2.0-liter inline-four engine inherited from the previous generation. A new addition is represented by the Xtronic CVT transmission, which reduces fuel consumption and offers a smoother driving experience. Whether for cost-reduction purposes or a better feel of the car, the 2024 Sentra also comes equipped with a standard six-speed manual transmission for the standard S grade and the performance-oriented SR grade. The new model is marked by a redesigned front end with a reshaped grille and a chrome trim accentuating the premium look. For a contrasting appearance, the headlights have a darker aspect. New 16-inch alloy wheels are available for the SV and SR grades. The SR grade also includes a redesigned back end of the car that seems wider and lower and introduces a dark chrome interpretation of the front grille. Also specific for the SR grade is the two-tone exterior that comes in various colors and is accompanied by a grade's unique interior stitching in a red-orange variant. The interior has many upgrades from the previous generation to increase comfort and provide a modern look. The main change is represented by the D-shaped steering wheel as well as the Nissan Z-inspired round air vents. From a technological standpoint, the 2024 Sentra presents an upgrade as it is standard equipped with a 7-inch infotainment system paired with a 4-speaker sound system but can be upgraded to an 8-inch screen and a 6-speaker audio system for the SV and SR grades. Technology becomes a part of the driving experience for a safer ride as the new Nissan Sentra has a standard feature called Nissan Safety Shield 360. It encapsulates six interconnected systems that act as a safety net for the driver, such as Pedestrian Detection, Rear Cross Traffic Alert, and class-exclusive Intelligent Forward Collision Warning. In conclusion, the 2024 Nissan Sentra has many features which show that building on an existing structure may be the best option when trying to extend a model's life in the market without increasing the cost of production too much.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Nissan Sentra"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""modern"", ""premium"", ""fuel-efficient"", ""upgraded""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""reshaped"", ""chrome-trimmed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""darker""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""16-inch alloy"", ""redesigned for SR grade""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Rogue,"Nissan refreshed the Rogue lineup for the 2024 model year, and besides the fresh look of the exterior, it also greatly improved the interior and, especially, the infotainment system. The Japanese automaker introduced the third generation of the Rogue in 2020, and that was not the right moment to launch a new vehicle due to the world pandemic situation. Still, Nissan didn’t want to let its customers wait and unveiled the vehicle anyway in the Summer of 2020. Then, the microchip crisis started and made things more complicated. But that didn’t defeat the carmaker either, and not only did it continue to sell the vehicle, but also its engineers continued working on the facelifted version of the Rogue. As a result, in the Fall of 2023, the third generation of this crossover was refreshed. One of the basic rules for any successful facelift is to improve the vehicle’s front fascia, which Nissan did. The design team had a challenging job to upgrade something that already looked appealing. So, instead of the previously used grille with a 3D-mesh pattern, the 2024 model year Rogue came with an improved design that featured five horizontal chromed slats. The lower part of the bumper was also reshaped and featured a black underbody shield adorned by two satin-chromed trims instead of the formerly used aluminum-looking one. Nissan also added a set of 18” alloy wheels for the SV trim level, two-tone paint schemes, and new colors to the options list. But the most significant improvement of the 2024 Rogue was on the interior, where the automaker upgraded the technology and connectivity package. It installed a 12.3” instrument cluster in front of the driver and a second 12.3” touchscreen atop the center stack for the Google-based infotainment system. These features were available for the SL and Platinum grades. In addition, the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity were kept in place, so users could use their smartphones to listen to their music, navigate, or stay in touch with their friends and family via phone conversations. These systems were wired for the S and SV grades, while the SL and Platinum ones were fitted with wireless connectivity systems. Passengers could sit comfortably either on the front bucket seats or on the rear split-folding (60/40) bench seat. Behind it, a 36.5 cu-ft. (1,033 liters) storage area could expand to up to 74.1 cu-ft. (2,098 liters) by completely folding down the rear seatback. Under the hood, the 2024 Rogue was fitted with a 1.5-liter turbocharged gasoline unit paired with an improved version of the Xtronic CVT. Thanks to the improved start/stop system, the 201 hp (203 PS) engine was also very fuel efficient. The all-wheel-drive system was available as an option for all four grades: S, SV, SL, and Platinum, while the front-wheel-drive version was standard.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Rogue"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""compact crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""appealing"", ""improved"", ""two-tone paint"", ""satin-chromed trims""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""horizontal"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""reshaped"", ""black underbody shield""],    ""wheel"": [""18-inch alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Tiida / Versa Sedan,"The Japanese automaker introduced the third generation of the Versa in 2018, and sales started well, but then, in 2020, when the pandemic situation shut down the industry, it went through difficult times. Yet, Nissan didn't collapse and continued producing the Versa, which proved to be a very effective solution in the affordable car market. That made it a top seller in its class, and Nissan tried to keep the momentum. So, after four years on the market, it was time for an upgrade. For the 2022 model year, the Versa came fitted with more standard options and an improved front fascia. While the S-trim level, the lowest, was still difficult to differentiate from its predecessor, the higher grades were easier to identify. Starting with the second grade, the car sported 16"", two-tone, alloy wheels with an option for a set of 17"". At the same time, the top-shelf version SR received chromed trims on the outer sides of its four-slat grille. Inside, Nissan improved its features. Even the S trim level got a standard 7"" touchscreen display atop the center stack. As an option, the automaker offered Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, starting with the S-Plus grade. Another essential upgrade was on the safety side, where all vehicles received better systems, such as Automatic Emergency Braking and Lane Departure Warning. The list continued for higher grades with Blind Spot Monitor and Rear Cross Traffic Alert. The 60/40 split-folding rear bench was standard on the entire lineup but the S-grade. Yet, there were no changes under the hood, where Nissan relied on the same 122 hp (124 PS) 1.6-liter gasoline engine paired with a five-speed manual for the S trim level or a CVT for the rest of the range.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Versa"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""affordable"", ""effective"", ""upgraded"", ""sporty"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""chromed"", ""four-slat""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""16-inch"", ""two-tone"", ""alloy"", ""17-inch option""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Leaf,"Nissan upgraded the second generation of the Leaf, the first mass-market electric vehicle in the world, and increased both the look and the onboard safety systems of the compact-sized EV. When the first generation of the Leaf was introduced on the market in 2010, it was the ugly duck of the family, but the one that won the 2011 World Car of The Year award. While it wasn't exactly the best bet in the compact segment, it was actually the best offer for an electric vehicle. It proved that the electric mobility was feasible, despite having a network of chargers at its disposal. But the ugly duck has been transformed into a beautiful swan, which took off in sales and respect on the market. With the refreshed version, the Leaf became more appealing. Its front fascia lost the chromed V-shape from the 2017 model, and that was the most obvious change. The carmaker also offered a new range of 16"" and 17"" light-alloy wheel options. Inside, the carmaker upgraded the infotainment unit with the NissanConnect system, which provided Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. Thus, the driver could get more out of the car, knowing exactly where they could find the next plug to charge the vehicle and even make a reservation for a charging port. In terms of safety, Nissan introduced the ProPilot assistance feature that kept a safe distance from the car in front. It could accelerate, decelerate, or stop accordingly. In terms of efficiency, the 2022 Leaf boasted a 385 km (239 miles) WLTP range.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Leaf"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""appealing"", ""efficient""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""chromed"", ""V-shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""16-inch"", ""17-inch"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN GT-R,"Nissan introduced another facelift for its supercar-killer GT-R in early 2023 at the Tokyo Auto Show, improving the vehicle's look and refining its ride qualities. Introduced in 2007 as a 2008 model year, the fifth generation of this Japanese sports car lost the Skyline nameplate and kept only the GT-R. At the time of its launch, it was a huge surprise and proved that Nissan could beat Porsche and Lamborghini at their own games. But, unfortunately, Nissan didn't come up with a new generation for the vehicle in more than 15 years. Instead, it chose to update it and upgrade it little by little. For the 2024 model year, the GT-R received a new aerodynamic upgrade that improved the car's downforce despite keeping the same drag coefficient of 0.26. That was possible by narrowing the front grille between the bumper and the hood and installing a thinner mesh. Nissan offered the supercar in three trim levels: GT-R Premium, T-Spec, and the GT-R NISMO, which was also the most powerful of them. At first sight, the vehicle's interior design didn't go through an essential upgrade. Still, the Nappa-wrapped dashboard and the new seats offered a glimpse of the car's new features. Atop the center stack, Nissan installed an 8"" infotainment unit that featured Apple CarPlay. In addition, for specific markets, it also featured satellite radio. To further enhance the sound, Nissan worked together with Bose for the 11-speaker system. Under the hood, the 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged V6 produced 565 hp (573 PS), which it sent in all corners via the acclaimed ATTESA ET-S all-wheel-drive system.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""GT-R"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""aerodynamic"", ""refined"", ""powerful"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""narrow""],    ""grille"": [""front"", ""thinner""],    ""hood"": [""refined""],    ""headlights"": [""sleek""],    ""bumper"": [""front""],    ""wheel"": [""N/A""],    ""doors"": [""N/A""],    ""roof"": [""N/A""],    ""diffusor"": [""N/A""],    ""spoiler"": [""N/A""],    ""exhaust"": [""N/A""]  }}```"
NISSAN Altima,"Nissan introduced the sixth generation of the Altima in 2019, and four years later, it introduced a well-deserved facelift for it. The 2023 Altima was vastly improved not only on the outside but also on the trim level specifications and safety features. Thus, customers could choose from up to eight versions of the midsize sedan. Previously, the Altima was available in five trim levels. Still, the carmaker reduced that number to four and re-arranged the standard amenities. Obviously, the most noticeable change on the Altima was the front fascia. Nissan dropped the chromed V-shaped trim from the front and left only a ""black chrome"" grille to support the round, chromed badge. Moreover, the side clusters were larger, offering a more aggressive stance for the vehicle. On the other hand, the headlights were LEDs as standard, which made the foglights obsolete and deleted them. Inside, the cabin featured new amenities, such as the optional 12.3"" touch-screen that resembled the one installed on the Altima's bigger sibling, the Armada. At the bottom of the center stack, Nissan offered a wireless charger, USB-C, USB, and charger ports. On the safety segment, the carmaker included the ProPilot Assist for the 2.5 SL and the 2.0 SR VC Turbo trim levels. Under the hood, the carmaker kept the same powerplants mated to the sluggish Nissan Xtronic (CVT) gearbox that sent the power to the front or all corners of the car.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Altima"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""midsize"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black chrome""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""standard""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN X-Trail,"Nissan introduced the fourth generation of its crossover X-Trail at the 2021 Auto Shanghai in China, and it was more of a revolution in the car's history. Based on the CMF-C platform shared with Nissan Qashqai and the 2022 Mitsubishi Outlander, the X-Trail, also known as the Rogue on the U.S. market, offered big changes on the exterior, interior, and drivetrain. Moreover, it had completely abandoned the turbo-diesel engines from its offer. The front fascia of the 2022 X-Trail featured the same design-signature V-shape chromed trim included on the radiator's grille. On the sides, it was flanked by new LED headlamps, with an upper lamp for the parking lights and blinkers, while the lower ones served as headlights. The bumper sported a pair of side scoops that channeled the air on the car's sides, while on the lower area, it featured a broad grille. From its profile, the X-Trail was surprised with its D-pillar's shape and the raked-forward rear windscreen. Inside, Nissan tried to create a premium atmosphere for its customers. Gone was the analog instrument panel, replaced by a TFT, while atop the center stack, it placed a 12.3"" infotainment display. In addition, the carmaker offered the 2022 X-Trail with up to seven seats inside, with an option for two jump-seats in the trunk area. Under the hood, Nissan offered just a choice of two drivetrains, both hybrid. The carmaker produced the fourth generation of the X-Trail, either with a front or an all-wheel drive system.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""X-Trail"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""revolutionary"", ""premium"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""dynamic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked-forward""],    ""grille"": [""V-shape"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""new""],    ""bumper"": [""sporty"", ""broad""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN GT-R Nismo,"After almost more than 15 years on the market, the GT-R received another upgrade, and the 2024 model year was unveiled at the 2023 Tokyo Auto Show. When the Japanese automaker unveiled the upgraded version, it also showed the top-of-the-range Nismo, which was the most aggressive-looking and powerful. While the GT-R Premium and the T-Spec were designed mostly for daily use, the Nismo received all the bells and whistles for successful track days. Fitted with a new and improved aerodynamic package, the GT-R Nismo managed to keep its drag resistance at the same levels as before, even though it provided increased downforce. Besides the narrower front grille fitted with thinner mesh, the enlarged lower lip, and redesigned canards, the GT-R Nismo also featured a 10% wider wing at the back. Furthermore, to complement the car's aggressive look, a set of 20"" light alloy wheels with semi-slick tires were fitted on the car. Inside, the automaker walked that extra mile to provide a better-looking and sportier interior. While the 2007 GT-R was fitted with high-bolstered bucket seats, the 2024 Nismo version came with carbon-fiber sports seats at the front. In addition, the Nappa-wrapped dashboard reduced reflections and glare, improving the driver's visibility. Atop the center stack, Nissan installed an 8"" infotainment unit that featured Apple CarPlay. In addition, for specific markets, it also featured satellite radio. To further enhance the sound, Nissan worked together with Bose for the 11-speaker system. Unlike its siblings, the Nismo version received a more powerful version of the same 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged V6. As a result, it offered 600 hp (608 PS). Still, the gearbox was the same six-speed dual-clutch system that sent the power in all corners via the ATTESA ET-S all-wheel-drive system.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""GT-R"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""aerodynamic"", ""sporty"", ""powerful"", ""improved""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""narrower"", ""front""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""20-inch"", ""light alloy"", ""semi-slick""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""10% wider""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Navara / Frontier Double Cab,"Nissan introduced a new generation of its Frontier pickup in February 2021 as a 2022 model year, and it was more than a utility vehicle. The mid-size pickup was no longer just a workhorse, and many customers preferred them for their off-road abilities. Instead of towing a trailer with tools and materials, these vehicles were more often seen towing a trailer with motorbikes, ATVs, or ski-jets. The customers started to be more concerned about comfort features rather than metallic bumpers. Last but not least, they asked for better-looking vehicles, not just tools on wheels. From the outside, the 2021 Frontier featured a completely renewed flat front area. Its LED headlights were unique on the market with their twin DRL light-strips design. The black grille sported the Nissan logo in the middle and a mesh pattern that mimicked a fence. Its tall bumper showed a cut in the middle to make room for a metallic shield, offered as an option. The beltline featured a small step on the front doors and a second one on the back of the rear ones from its sides. Inside, Nissan installed a flat front-fascia dashboard with a slightly rounded instrument cluster where it placed a 7” display. A 9” infotainment touch-screen claimed the top side of the center stack. Like its predecessor, the Frontier was offered in two cab versions: King and Crew. Depending on the version, a 5- or 6-ft bed was fitted as standard. Under the hood, Nissan installed a new, direct fuel injected, 3.8-liter V-6 paired as standard to a 9-speed automatic (dual-clutch) transmission. It was available with 2WD or 4WD with a shift-on-the-fly ability and a low-range gear. The carmaker installed an LSD as standard for off-road enthusiasts, while an electric locking differential was available on specific versions.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Frontier"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""renewed flat front area"", ""LED headlights with twin DRL light-strips"", ""black grille with mesh pattern"", ""tall bumper with cut in the middle"", ""small step on the beltline""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black"", ""mesh pattern""],    ""hood"": [""flat""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""twin DRL light-strips""],    ""bumper"": [""tall"", ""cut in the middle""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""front with small step"", ""rear with small step""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Qashqai,"Nissan unveiled the third generation of its compact SUV Qashqai at the beginning of 2021, and it showed a completely new design language for the Japanese brand. In 2007, Nissan surprised the market with the first generation of the Qashqai. It was a revolutionary vehicle for the Japanese carmaker, who offered the compact SUV as an alternative for the compact station wagons. Thanks to Nissan's experience in 4x4 vehicles, the Qashqai quickly became one of the best-selling vehicles in its segment and proved to be a trustworthy partner for its customers. The 2021 model was built on the CMF-C Alliance platform shared with the Nissan Rogue and Mitsubishi Outlander. Its front grille with an enlarged V-shaped chromed trim was a clear feature for the Nissan brand. With the fourth generation, the Qashqai displayed a different light signature with the LED daytime running lights at the top and then the slim LED headlights underneath. Its bold look was a clear statement for the successful car, which was sold in over three million units worldwide in its previous generations. Inside, Nissan sent the Qashqai into the new technology age with the introduction of the 9"" touch-screen display for the infotainment system and a 12.3"" TFT display in the instrument cluster. In addition to these, Nissan introduced a 10.8"" Head-up Display that showed all the necessary information projected on the windscreen. Under the hood, the carmaker introduced the e-Power version that was based on a gasoline engine and an electric motor. The rest of the range was filled with mild-hybrid versions powered by a 1.3-liter turbocharged gasoline engine. There are no turbo-diesel versions anymore.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Qashqai"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""bold"", ""revolutionary"", ""trustworthy"", ""enlarged V-shaped grille"", ""different light signature""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""projected""],    ""grille"": [""enlarged"", ""V-shaped"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [""bold""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""slim""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Pathfinder,"Nissan introduced the 2022 Pathfinder in February 2021 at the same time as the Frontier, and it showed a new design language plus a ton of high-tech features. After thirty-five years on the market, the Pathfinder gathered all the information required to make a stand in its class and tried to be more convincing than anyone else. But every silver lining has its clouds, and that was the engine option. It was a good one, but only one. From the outside, the Pathfinder was a mix between the rugged look of the Frontier and the soapy one from the Murano. Its front side featured a deep chromed rim for the black, massive grille. The headlights featured two LED daytime running lights and narrow headlamps. At the bottom of the front, wrapped-around bumper, the carmaker installed a metallic shield. From its sides, the designers induced the idea of a floating roof thanks to the black B- and D-pillars, while the C-pillar featured a black upper side. Inside, the Pathfinder provided room for up to seven passengers. The second and third rows were folding so the vehicle could carry a 4x8 ft plywood. Even though Nissan emphasized that the car didn't forget its utility values, it focused on comfort features. At the front, a new digital dashboard with a 12.3"" touch-screen display for the infotainment system welcomed its passengers. The driver enjoyed the 10.8"" display for the instrument cluster, and everyone else enjoyed the comfortable ride. Pathfinder 4WD drive models featured Nissan's all-new Intelligent 4WD with 7-position Drive and Terrain Mode Selector. The 4WD system provided direct coupling, which allowed torque transfer directly on the clutch pack using oil pressure, allowing for confident, immediate take-off in low-traction situations. But Nissan considered installing only one engine option.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Pathfinder"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""midsize"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""soapy"", ""comfortable"", ""high-tech"", ""utilitarian""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""narrow""],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""narrow"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""wrapped-around"", ""metallic""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""floating"", ""black""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Armada,"The upgraded Armada was a full-size SUV with a rugged body-on-frame construction. For 2021, the Armada was highly redesigned, as the previous model had been around for quite some time and started to look dated. The exterior design changes included a new grilled, a new hood, restyled front and rear bumpers, LED headlights and stoplights, as well as a new exterior color added to the list. The Armada was fitted with a 5.6-liter V8 engine that cranked out around 400 hp and 394 pound-feet of torque. The thirsty powerplant was mated with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Depending on the market, the Armada could be equipped with either a two-wheel drive or a four-wheel-drive system. Canada only offered the four-wheel-drive system as standard. The full-size SUV weighed around 2.7 tons, however, the 5.6-liter engine handled it really well, with a quick acceleration response. Considering its weight and the size, it’s easy to say that the fuel consumption was no synonym to economy. Practicality was one of the Armada’s strongest points, as it offered huge space inside. The large SUV could accommodate up to 8 passengers, unless the 2nd row was chosen with captain chairs, which allowed only 7 passengers. The 3rd row of seats was mostly designed for children, as adults would have felt a little uncomfortable on longer journeys. The 3rd row folded flat to increase the cargo area to around 1400 liters, however, even with the 3rd row up, the Armada still offered more than enough space. Designed for larger families, the Armada was a safe car, being equipped with the latest safety features available.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Armada"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""full-size SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""restyled"", ""practical"", ""safe""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""new""],    ""hood"": [""new""],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""restyled""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Kicks,"Presented for the first time in 2017, the Nissan Kicks made a huge impression with its versatility, offering cutting-edge technology for a competitive price. Nissan redesigned the Kicks for 2020 with the aim of attracting even more young buyers. The new compact crossover brought new useful features to the table, such as easy smartphone connectivity with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. While the S (base) trim level came with a 7.0-inch touchscreen display, the upper trim levels, the SV and the SR featured a bigger 8.0-inch color touchscreen. Practicality was enhanced with no less than 3 USB ports available and a USB Type-C for the upper trim levels. The cabin was fitted with a brand new center console, new seating and also different trims. The exterior was restyled and the Kicks featured the Nissan’s “Double V-Motion” grille. While the base model came with steel wheels, the other trim levels included redesigned wheels. Heavily customisable, the Kicks was available with an extensive list of available exterior paint colors, be it one color or the two-tone exterior available for the top-of-the-range trim level. In total, the Kicks was available with over 100 million color combinations to match each customer’s personal style. A strong competitor in the class, the Kicks offered great interior space, for both the front and the rear passengers. The latest safety technologies were available with the redesigned crossover, starting with traction control, anti-lock braking system, electric power steering and rear disc brakes for the SV and the SR, to an intelligent cruise control system, active engine brake, intelligent trace control and intelligent ride control. Even the standard version of the Kick was well equipped, however, the SV included a long list of features for great value.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Nissan Kicks"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""compact crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""versatile"", ""modern"", ""customizable"", ""practical"", ""competitive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""Double V-Motion""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""redesigned""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Micra 5 Doors,"While all the world was fighting with a pandemic situation, the carmakers had to adapt and adjust their lineups to comply with new pollution rules. Nissan Micra was already in its fifth generation, and it shook the market with its striking look. It was so bold that just a few noticed that it featured rear drum-brakes while other carmakers only had those systems in their museums. But the customers didn't care about that. They cared about look, pollution, comfort, and safety, not necessarily in that order. From the outside, the 2020 Micra kept the Z-shaped side lines to connect with the famous Nissan Z-vehicles. A new set of headlights was introduced and showed more character, especially when they were upgraded to LED lights. To enhance the side look, Nissan fitted the Micra with wheels up to 17"", for the N-Sport trim level. Inside, the Micra was enhanced with new materials for the upholstery and a wide customization program, including a bold orange interior. On the dashboard, it featured a new infotainment unit that supported Android Auto and Apple Carplay. Like the non-facelifted version, a Bose sound system was available at extra costs. Renault-Nissan Alliance installed a 1.0-liter turbocharged engine and axed the 1.5-diesel unit used on the 2016 model under the hood.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Micra"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""striking"", ""bold"", ""characteristic"", ""enhanced"", ""wide""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""upgraded"", ""characteristic""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""up to 17\""""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Juke,"Almost ten years after the first ever Juke made it appearance and changed the scenery in the compact crossover segment, Nissan decided to unveil its second generation, going for a much more mature design this time. Unlike its predecessor, the 2020 Nissan Juke looked a lot more mellow from most angles, but it still had a stand-out design among its rivals. Although bigger and roomier than the first generation, the Juke was slightly lighter, weighing 23 kilograms less thanks to the clever usage of high-strength steel in all the right places. At the beginning of the production, the model was powered only by a 1.0-liter, turbocharged three-cylinder with 117 PS, which was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. No all-wheel-drive versions were available at launch either. For the first time, the Juke was available with the proPILOT techonology developed by Nissan, a package offering electronically assisted steering, acceleration and braking, thus easing driving on the highway and in traffic. Using the Nissan Connect infotainment system, buyers could efficiently use their devices with Android Auto or Apple CarPlay through an 8-inch touchscreen display. Other features included TomTom maps, Live Traffic and on-board wireless hotspot for the passengers to enjoy the ride at its maximum using their laptops or tablets. The sound system chose by Nissan for the new Juke was a Bose Personal Plus sound system. It included 8 powerful speakers and two UltraNearfield units mounted in the front headrests.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Nissan Juke"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""compact crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""mature"", ""stand-out"", ""roomier"", ""lighter"", ""mellow""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""mellow""],    ""hood"": [""clever"", ""high-strength""],    ""headlights"": [""powerful""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Navara / Frontier King Cab,"Nissan has a very long experience in off-road vehicles and one of its top-models is the Nissan Navara/Frontier pickup. In 2016, this model surprised the market by launching the first vehicle in its segment with coil springs at the rear, whereas all the others offered leaf-springs. At the beginning of 2020, Nissan showed an updated version. Some things are as good as they are and the Nissan Navara/Frontier King Cab is one of those vehicles, having been praised around the world. Now Nissan has added some changes, just to update it to the new rules and regulations regarding emission and safety norms. But the carmaker didn't have to work too much since the car was very good since its launch. The revised 2020 Navara King Cab has new headlights and other small visual changes. But the real upgrade is underneath the surface. Under the hood, there is the same 2.3-liter turbodiesel engine from Renault, but both variants of it are twin-turbo. The entry model has a mere 3 hp increase to a total of 163 hp but has a bigger torque, reaching 425 Nm (313.5 lb-ft). The top version has the same 190 hp. Fuel consumption has been improved and now it has a combined value of 6.9l/100 km. The transmission offered is either a new 6-speed manual gearbox or the same 7-speed automatic as before. For stopping power, Nissan has installed new 320 mm discs on the front and replaced the old rear drums with new 308 mm discs. Thanks to some other weight savings on the vehicle, the payload has been increased to 1165 kg (2598 lbs).",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Nissan Navara/Frontier"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""mid-size pickup"",  ""overall-design"": [""reliable"", ""rugged"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""updated""],    ""headlights"": [""new""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Titan Crew Cab,"Nissan introduced the refreshed version of the Titan’s second generation in 2019 for the 2020 model year, and it came with some significant improvements. The Titan nameplate appeared on the market in 2003 and competed in the full-size pickup truck segment. In 2016, Nissan launched the second generation of this nameplate and tried to compete with vehicles such as the Ford F-150 or the RAM 1500, to name just a few. After several updates in the following years, the automaker decided to launch a refreshed version in 2019, improving the vehicle’s exterior and interior. Unfortunately, the vehicle appeared in unfavorable moments when the pandemic struck the world. Even if that situation affected sales, Nissan tried to keep the model on the market but offered it in fewer versions than before. As a result, customers could get the vehicle in a choice of four trim levels, with either a King Cab or a Crew Cab, while the regular cab was scrapped from the list. At the front, the automaker offered a choice of three grilles for the 2020 Nissan Titan Crew Cab, with body color, black, or a satin chromed finish, the latter being reserved for the Platinum Reserve grade. Along with the refreshed version, Nissan installed LED headlights for its largest pickup. Changes went further with the introduction of new packages that offered customers the option for two-tone paint jobs, side steps, or an off-road-oriented styling with exposed red towing hooks for the Pro-X grade. Inside, the Titan Crew Cab offered the same ample room where five adult-sized passengers could sit comfortably. On the center stack, the automaker installed an 8” touchscreen for the infotainment system fitted as standard, while a 9” unit was available as an option. In front of the driver, Nissan enhanced the instrument cluster with a 7-inch display, which was the largest in its category at the time of launch, that was placed between the analog dials of the speedometer and tachometer. The front seats were wide and were designed using the “zero-gravity” concept, which made them very comfortable on long travels. A wide center console separated the front occupants. It housed a few storage areas, two cup holders, and a tall center armrest. At the same time, Nissan offered USB ports and outboard heated seats for the rear seated occupants. Furthermore, a power outlet was also installed on the center console’s end. Nissan kept the same 5.6-liter V8 engine, producing enough power and torque for the full-size pickup. It was paired with a nine-speed automatic gearbox that sent power to the rear or in all corners, depending on the option. The 4WD versions also featured rear locking differential. When it made the Titan, Nissan used the classic solution with front independent suspension and leaf springs for the rear solid axle, which gave the vehicle adequate road behavior and a decent payload for its class.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Nissan Titan"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""full-size pickup truck"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""improved"", ""full-size"", ""competitive"", ""off-road-oriented""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""body color"", ""black"", ""satin chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""wide""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""V8""]  }}```"
NISSAN Maxima,"The eighth generation of Nissan's flagship in the U.S. market went through a mild facelift in 2018. It was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show. The Nissan Maxima turned from a large sedan to a sport sedan. The car was unveiled in 2015 and it was improved to look like a sport sedan, despite being a front-wheel-drive vehicle. The mass distribution and the power to weight ratio were good. The 2019 model-year featured new headlights with full-LED. The grille was reshaped and looked more aggressive than before. For the side view, the floating roof design was kept and enhanced with a minor chromed detail on the C-pillar. In the rear, new LED taillights were installed. The 19” light-alloy wheels have received a new design. Inside, there was a new diamond design for the top trim level. Other than that, the 2019 Maxima offered more safety features in the Safety Shield 360 package. That included the Automatic Emergency Braking with Pedestrian Detection, Blind Spot Warning, Rear Cross Traffic Alert, Lane Departure Warning, High Beam Assist and Rear Automatic Braking. It was a standard fit for the Platinum and part of the SR Premium Package. Under the hood, there was the same 300 hp 3.5-liter V6 engine mated to a CVT transmission. The steering and suspension were reworked for better cornering speed",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Nissan Maxima"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""large sedan to sport sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""aggressive"", ""enhanced"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""reshaped"", ""aggressive""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""full-LED"", ""new""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""19” light-alloy"", ""new design""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""floating"", ""enhanced"", ""chromed detail""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Murano,"Nissan refreshed the third generation of the Murano in 2018 for the 2019 model year, adding more flavor to the stylish crossover vehicle. Although a well-known off-road automaker, Nissan introduced the Murano lineup without any off-road-inspired cladding and technology. Moreover, it was even offered with a two-door convertible bodywork. The third generation was launched in 2014 at the Los Angeles Auto Show, and the Japanese automaker chose the same environment in 2018 to unveil the facelifted version. But the refresh was slightly disappointing. The third generation of the Murano was well-designed, and thus, Nissan felt to only partially improve the car's look. Still, it added LED lights all around, matching the trend in the automotive sector. Also, the front bumper was changed and now sported a new design for the lower area, with a broader center intake flanked by triangular clusters for the new LED fog lights. Moreover, the car could've been ordered with 18"" or 20"" light-alloy wheels, and three more colors were added to the options list. In addition, the car's exterior received chromed trims instead of satin-silver ones. Customers could find the same cozy, warm interior with bucket seats at the front and a split-folding bench at the rear. One of the most significant improvements was the infotainment system, which now offered standard Android Auto and Apple Carplay technology, easing the connection with smartphones. Under the hood, there were no apparent changes since the carmaker still offered the same 3.5-liter V6 paired with an X-Tronic (CVT) gearbox that sent power to the front wheels for the base trim level or in all corners.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Murano"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""stylish"", ""refreshed"", ""well-designed"", ""cozy"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sleek""],    ""grille"": [""chromed""],    ""hood"": [""smooth""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""triangular""],    ""bumper"": [""redesigned"", ""broader""],    ""wheel"": [""18-inch/20-inch"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [""two-door""],    ""roof"": [""convertible""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Note,"Nissan introduced a second update to its small-sized MPV Note, also known as the Versa in some countries, trying to gain more money from the five-years-old vehicle. When Nissan introduced the Versa/Note on the market based on the same platform as the Micra and the Almera, it tried to convince people that the MPV is the best solution for a small family that looks for a spacious, yet short, vehicle. It wasn't a complete success on the market, but good enough for the bean counters to keep it on the assembly lines. After the first facelift, which happened in 2014, the carmaker decided to improve it again in 2017. Nissan already introduced the V-shaped chromed trim on most of its models, but the Note was still left with the older version. The 2017 model-year fixed that. It also sported a new front bumper, which looked sportier than before, with the lower apron and a small lip at the bottom. On the sides, the newly designed 15"" or 16"" alloy wheels, depending on the options, created an image of a sports-chic vehicle. Inside, the carmaker tried to induce another sporty appearance with silver plastic trims on the dashboard, steering wheel, center console, and door handles. It also sported bigger cup holders, a new 12-volt plug, and a relocated USB port for the sound system. The upgraded infotainment unit was still placed in the middle of the center stack, between the upper air vents and the lower climate-control knobs. Like its non-facelifted version, the 2017 model-year offered a high seating position and enough room for five adult passengers. Under the hood, Nissan installed a new, 1.6-liter powerplant mated as standard with a CVT gearbox named X-Tronic by the carmaker.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Note/Versa"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""spacious"", ""sporty"", ""chic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""V-shaped"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [""sportier""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""sportier"", ""new front bumper""],    ""wheel"": [""15\"" or 16\"" alloy"", ""sports-chic""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Serena,"The Nissan Serena began its production in 1991 and started off as a compact passenger minivan. The van's size increased during the following generations. In 2016, Nissan unveiled the fifth generation of the model. The biggest feature added was Nissan's ProPilot technology, an advanced driver assistance system designed for highway use. The technology was developed to maintain the car's lane position and distance from the vehicle in front. The interior became more spacious and the wheelbase was extended by 180 mm. New features were included to increase the ease of use. The sliding doors can easily be opened by sliding your foot under the door, so that you wouldn't need to use your hands. While still keeping some design details of the previous Serena model, the 2016 has a more dynamic and refined look: a refreshed front grille, a floating roof design and 13-color availability, including a new two-tone design. Other significant features include a 6-port USB power socket, Zero Gravity seats with spinal support, a large 7-inch display and a capless fuel filler. The cabin's quietness was improved and the model's handling was upgraded as well, especially at low speeds. The car is equipped with an automatic parking assist system, a smart rearview mirror and an Around View Monitor that provides a virtual 360-degree scene. Nissan provided important safety features such as Forward Emergency Braking, Emergency Assist and Lane Departure Warning. Lots of other key safety and environmental features are available.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Nissan Serena"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""larger"",  ""overall-design"": [""dynamic"", ""refined"", ""spacious"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""refreshed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sliding"", ""hands-free""],    ""roof"": [""floating""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Patrol LWB,"Nissan unveiled a facelift for the Patrol range in 2014, and it brought several updates for it, especially for its look. On some markets, the sixth generation of the Patrol was the biggest Nissan on the offer. Due to stricter emission regulations and low market potential, the Japanese carmaker dropped it from the offer. The European customers were left behind in teary eyes for the big SUV, while the Australians were unhappy since there was no diesel option. Nevertheless, the Patrol was still one of the best off-road vehicles, and its main playground was the wide-open desert. The design team tried their best to make the Patrol Y62 look smoother, but it was like trying to reshape a brick with a nail-polisher. Somehow, they succeeded in implementing a new bumper that was curved upward towards the headlights. It's new LED daytime running lights and the massive, three-parts chromed grille was imposing and resembled the previous Patrol models. The front fenders air-vents from the sides were elongated and still made some people wondering if they were used for something other than design. They could if the owner modified it. Inside, it was the same large barge with room for up to eight people with impressive headroom, even for the versions fitted with a sunroof. The carmaker did the interior with luxurious trims such as heated and cooled leather seats, wood-trims, and an infotainment system carried over from the Infiniti squad. Under the hood, Nissan installed only V8 gasoline engines. Their fuel-efficiency was down the drain, but their performances were remarkable, especially for the full-options version that featured a Mercedes-Benz 7-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Patrol"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""imposing"", ""smooth"", ""luxurious"", ""remarkable"", ""spacious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""chromed"", ""imposing""],    ""hood"": [""curved""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""new""],    ""bumper"": [""curved"", ""upward""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN 370Z,"Updated for 2012, the beloved 370Z looked like the modern variant of the 240Z, with its low roofline and the popped out rear fenders. The 370Z came with 3 versions: the standard coupe, the roadster and the super sporty Nismo. Driven by a 3.7-liter V6 engine, the 370Z had 332 hp and 270 nM of torque. The power was sent to the real wheels through a 6-speed manual transmission. The 370Z was fitted with a small, cozy cabin, that offered great legroom and headroom for the people in the front seats. The dashboard had a simple and clean layout and offered a decent storage space in the center. The load area was not the best, as the trunk was shaped by the shock towers, thus limiting the available space. The strut bar in the back, although great for rigidity, blocked longer items to be placed in the trunk. Tall objects were also hard to fit in the trunk due to the trunk’s glass lid. The visibility inside the 370Z was rather poor, the B and C pillars forming a block in the driver’s vision, making it harder in passes. The cabin was driver-focused, with additional gauges indicating voltage and oil temperature. The driver could adjust the steering wheel and the cluster altogether. The 370Z ran on 19-inch beautifully designed alloys borrowed from the GTR. Wider tires were used in the back.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""370Z"",  ""year"": ""2012"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""modern"", ""sporty"", ""cozy"", ""driver-focused"", ""clean""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""low""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""popped out""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""19-inch"", ""beautifully designed"", ""wider""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""low""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Quest,"The fourth generation of the Nissan Quest was introduced at the 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show. While other car-makers started to drop their big MPVs, the Japanese company struggled to find its customers. From 2004 'till 2009, the MPV sales dropped from 1.1 million units to a mere 400.000. It was understandable why most of the car-makers didn't want to go there anymore. The customers already moved toward the SUV segment. But Nissan kept the big family car. It wasn't a smart choice. The tall minivan tried to look sportier in a segment where that was the least attribute someone expected. The trapezoidal grille and the cat-eye headlights style made the car look somehow aggressive. An ascending sculpted line on the side improved the dynamic appearance. In the back, a flat and vertical tailgate with a roof-spoiler on top ended the MPV design. The interior was an important aspect of the Quest. The dashboard styling looked inspired by the sportier sedans such as the Altima. The in-dash gear selector was close to the steering wheel. The three-dial instrument cluster placed the speedometer in the middle. The Bose sound system was offered on the options list, along with a navigation unit. The seven-seat configuration with two captain chairs on the second row added more comfort to the vehicle. Even the last three-seat bench in the back was good for full-grown adults. The Quest was offered with a 3.5-liter under the hood that offered 260 hp. It was mated as standard to a CVT. That type of gearboxes is known for being efficient, but not sporty. Yet, the Quest offered reasonable 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 kph) times and still being fuel-efficient in its class.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Nissan Quest"",  ""year"": ""2010"",  ""size"": ""big family car"",  ""overall-design"": [""tall"", ""sporty"", ""dynamic"", ""aggressive"", ""comfortable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""tall""],    ""grille"": [""trapezoidal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""cat-eye""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Teana,"The Japanese carmaker introduced the second generation of the Teana lineup in 2008 at the Beijing Auto Show, and it proved that Nissan could offer luxury vehicles outside the Infiniti badge. Nissan was on the verge of upgrading its lineup and introduced a large sedan on specific markets worldwide. It wasn't available everywhere to not interfere with the Renault Latitude in Europe or with the Maxima in the U.S. But it shared the same qualities that made those vehicles good in their class. Long as an executive sedan, with not a single flat surface on its bodywork, the Teana showed no fear in front of competitors such as the Audi or Jaguar. Its wide grille with horizontal slats and swept-back, vertical headlights were unusual for its times. Its raked windshield and curved roof made the vehicle more aerodynamic. Under its sloped D-pillars, the carmaker installed the third row of windows behind the rear doors. Inside, the Teana featured the same infotainment system used for the Infiniti range, with a controller on the center stack's upper side. For the base models, Nissan offered the vehicle with a velour interior. The upper trim levels featured leather upholstery and wood-trims on the dashboard, center console, and door panels. Thanks to its long wheelbase, the rear seat passengers had enough legroom and headroom. Under the hood, Nissan installed three engine choices. They were all paired to an X-Tronic gearbox (CVT), which sent the power to the front wheels.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Teana"",  ""year"": ""2008"",  ""size"": ""large sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxury"", ""aerodynamic"", ""sleek"", ""elegant"", ""spacious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [""wide"", ""horizontal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back"", ""vertical""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""large""],    ""doors"": [""rear""],    ""roof"": [""curved""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Almera / Pulsar Sedan,"As most of the car-manufacturers did, Nissan introduced some vehicles for specific markets such it was the case with the 2011 Almera Sedan. It was introduced for the South-East Asian market. The Japanese car-maker was already in an alliance with Renault and the French engineers had good expertise in building cheap cars for rough roads, such as those from Thailand and the Philippines. Nissan, on the other hand, had a better reputation in that area and so, the 2011 Almera was introduced as an inexpensive family sedan. With a design that wouldn't win any beauty contest, the 2011 Almera Sedan followed the basic lines of the Versa and Tiida. The three-box sedan shape was built for a big interior room and trunk. It looked like it was built from inside out. Inside, the Almera Sedan offered 5 seats and enough legroom and headroom for the rear passengers. It was fitted with an AC unit and vents for the rear passengers with dedicated control for a rear ventilator. The Bluetooth connection, steering wheel controls, and power-windows were on the standard features. The only engine available was a 1.5-liter gasoline engine mated to a standard 5-speed manual, and an option for an automatic, while the top trim level came with a standard automatic tranny. The front McPherson suspension and trailing arms in the rear were built for harsher terrain, and with a bigger ground clearance than a regular sedan.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Almera Sedan"",  ""year"": ""2011"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""inexpensive"", ""family"", ""basic"", ""roomy"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""basic""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""basic""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""basic""],    ""wheel"": [""standard""],    ""doors"": [""functional""],    ""roof"": [""regular""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""standard""]  }}```"
NISSAN Skyline,"Nissan introduced the twelfth generation of the Skyline sedan in 2006 only for the Japanese market, while the rest of the world, including the U.S. customers, received the Infiniti M series. The 2006 Skyline sedan was the sporty version of its famous brother GT-R, but it was less-powered and rear-wheel-drive only. It was sold only in Japan, while the U.S. market and the rest of the world received it as an Infiniti M35. It was the same car, but with RHD and different badges. There were also a few other noticeable differences between the two siblings. Unlike its predecessor, it followed a new, flowing-design trend, with swept-back headlights that resembled those installed on the Infiniti G35 Coupe. Its raked grille sported four horizontal slats and additional two chromed ones on top and on the bottom. The bumper featured a lower apron with an incorporated spoiler. Nissan included the fog lights inside the headlamps, on their inner side. The designers made the rear window sloped and the decklid short to emphasize the car's sedan orientation for sportiness. Inside, the high bolstered seats at the front were inspired by those from the G35 Coupe. Nissan created a unique design for the instrument cluster, without individual casings for the speedometer and tachometer. The Skyline featured a screen for the infotainment system similar to the one from the Nissan Primera, controlled via a distinct control panel on top of the center stack. The carmaker offered the Skyline with a choice of three V-6 engines, starting with a 2.5-liter and ending with a 3.7-liter. Depending on the engine, the carmaker paired the powerplants to a six-speed manual or to a five- or seven-speed automatic transmission.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Skyline"",  ""year"": ""2006"",  ""size"": ""sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""sleek"", ""flowing"", ""sloped"", ""short""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""raked"", ""horizontal"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [""incorporated"", ""sporty""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""short""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Terrano 5 Doors,"The Terrano name was successful in the European and other markets around the world, but it was axed once the Japanese carmaker went into an alliance with Renault. But, in 2013, they brought it back. Being into an alliance with Renault brought some advantages to Nissan. Even though the Japanese carmaker was an expert in the 4x4 sector, it didn't succeed to make affordable, unibody, SUVs. In Europe, the best SUV recipe was the Dacia Duster, which was sold on some other markets as the Renault Duster. Nissan engineers took that compact SUV and reshaped it in the form of the 2013 Terrano. Nissan started to work on the car by changing the front fascia to a more recognizable grille from a Nissan Patrol with chromed slats and bigger, angular headlights. On the side, a subtle line was drawn on the bottom of the doors. The liftgate featured an additional light unit on it, to complement the fixed to the body taillights. Inside the car, there was the same adequate room for a compact SUV vehicle. Five adults could fit inside the car. The multimedia unit was different than the one found on the Renault/Dacia Duster. Under the hood, the Terrano featured the same engines as the Duster, with front or all-wheel-drive systems. The all-wheel-drive versions featured independent suspensions on all four corners, while the front-wheel drive version was fitted with a twisting beam in the back.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Terrano"",  ""year"": ""2013"",  ""size"": ""compact SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""recognizable grille"", ""angular headlights"", ""subtle side line"", ""adequate room"", ""different multimedia unit""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""recognizable"", ""chromed slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""bigger"", ""angular""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""subtle line at bottom""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Primera Sedan,"Unveiled at the 2001 Barcelona Motor Show, the Nissan Primera had a distinctive design compared to the previous models. While the Nissan Primera was already a good car, it was also boring, bringing nothing more than a good drive. However, things changed starting with 2001, and the new sedan became interesting and almost pretty. While it retained some of the second generation’s styling cues, such as the wing-styled front grille, although larger. Inside, the Nissan Primera offered great space for its occupants. The unconventional interior design draw attention and drivers might have needed a little time to adjust. All the main instruments and controls were placed in the center, including the cluster gauges. The way the controls were arranged gave the impression of a flying spaceship interior. Pretty unique for a car in its segment for 2002, the Primer had a rear-view camera that enhanced safety when parking or driving in reverse, thus not noticing pets, bicycles and small children was almost impossible. The 3rd generation of Primera came with broad range of engines mated with a 5 or 6-speed automatic transmission or the optional Continuous Variable Transmission. Safety was also a strong point, as the Primer was awarded 4 stars for side impact and good frontal driver/passengers impact.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Nissan Primera"",  ""year"": ""2001"",  ""size"": ""sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""distinctive"", ""interesting"", ""pretty"", ""unconventional"", ""unique""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wing-styled"", ""larger""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Sakura,"Nissan introduced the Sakura model in its lineup as an electric-only vehicle in 2022, a small-sized kei-car that could offer a range of 180 km (111 miles) and provide room for four adults. After Mitsubishi joined the Renault-Nissan Alliance, most of its research in the EV segment became known and used by its new partners, which helped it escape from extinction. Nissan used the same platform used for the Mitsubishi eK X EV and produced the Sakura. A model that was showcased as a concept car in 2019. The vehicle's name is taken from the traditional Japanese cherry blossom. The Sakura was designed mostly as a small-sized MPV. Its very short front end and the tall greenhouse were typical for the kei-car segment. At the front, Nissan placed a broad black grille regardless of the car's color. Yet, since it was an EV, the grille was actually a panel, while a lower opening in the apron took responsibility for cooling the battery pack and other electric features. On the base trim level, the car featured regular headlights, while the upper versions received three-projectors LED headlamps, a first in the vehicle's segment. The tall greenhouse and five-door configuration were revealed from the Sakura's profile. Inside, the carmaker installed a simple design that featured a storage area in front of the side passenger. Nissan installed a TFT display in front of the driver while a second touch-screen sat above the middle section of the dashboard. The gear selector and the climate-control buttons cluttered the center stack. For the front passengers, the carmaker installed a pair of high-mounted bucket seats, while at the back, a split-folding bench offered enough room for two additional occupants. The drivetrain consisted of a single motor that provided 47 kW (64 hp) sent to the front wheels only. It was fed by a 20 kWh lithium-ion battery pack. The car also could serve as a powerbank, being able to provide electricity for a whole day for a house.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Sakura"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""small-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""small-sized"", ""MPV"", ""electric"", ""traditional"", ""simple""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""tall""],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""black""],    ""hood"": [""short""],    ""headlights"": [""regular"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""lower opening""],    ""wheel"": [""front""],    ""doors"": [""five-door""],    ""roof"": [""tall""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN NV,"Built on a modified version of Nissan’s B Platform, the NV200 was conceived to offer both commercial and passenger carrying capabilities, bringing lots of space, front wheel traction and a compact but efficient rear suspension system. Unlike other vans in its class, the seats were not removable when ordered in passenger configuration. The middle row backrest had a 60/40 split to increase versatility and the entire assembly tumbles forward to fold flat against the front seats, while the rear pari fold individually to either side of the loading area. The interior was packed with storage spaces, pockets and cup holders and there’s also a secret storage space within the upper glovebox compartment, enough to stash mobile phones, a camera or vital documents. The engine mounted on the Nissan NV200 was a 1.5-liter dCi turbo diesel, that developed 86 hp. The engine was mated to a 5-speed manual transmission. The car had a maximum payload capacity of 771 kg and had the largest cargo area in its class. It was equipped with big sliding doors to offer easy access to the load area. The interior was a simple, airy one, with an intelligently placed gear knob. The steering wheel wasn’t offered with any adjustments. Optionals include a rearview camera, Nissan’s Intelligent Key, power windows and ESP.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Nissan NV200"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""efficient"", ""spacious"", ""versatile"", ""simple"", ""airy""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""big"", ""sliding""],    ""doors"": [""big"", ""sliding"", ""easy access""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Grand Livina,"A seven-seat passenger was always a good idea for specific markets, and Nissan introduced the Grand Livina in 2006 for South East Asia and then for other countries. Nissan knew that in some markets, there was a high demand for affordable seven-seat vehicles. It already offered a barely enough sized vehicle for seven passengers in India, even though it featured seven seats. The Livina was a different story, though. Nissan built it on an extended version of the Tiida's/Almera platform. Its shape resembled the European Dacia Lodgy, but it was more stylish. From the outside, the Grand Livina featured a specific Nissan front end with Tiida-like angular headlights. A chromed decoration adorned the black grille between them, while the bumper featured an A-shaped lower grille flanked by the round fog lights. The waved line that started from the front fenders continued on the door panels onto the rear quarter panels. Its tall window was needed for a roomy greenhouse, while in the back, Nissan installed a liftgate. The interior featured a hard plastic dashboard and round vents for the ventilation system. An AC unit was available as an option. Its front and middle-row seats were high-mounted to provide enough legroom for full-grown adults, while the rear folding seats were squeezed between the wheel-arches. Under the hood, Nissan installed a choice of two gasoline engines which provided 108 hp and 126 hp, respectively. Strangely, the carmaker offered a four-speed automatic gearbox only for the less-powered version.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Nissan Grand Livina"",  ""year"": ""2006"",  ""size"": ""extended"",  ""overall-design"": [""affordable"", ""stylish"", ""roomy"", ""angular"", ""tall""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""tall""],    ""grille"": [""black"", ""chromed"", ""A-shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angular""],    ""bumper"": [""A-shaped""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""waved""],    ""roof"": [""roomy""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Sunny,"Nissan introduced the 2010 Sunny sedan exclusively for the Chinese market, although in other countries, the carmaker offered a similar version named Versa or Tiida Sedan. The Japanese automaker was already known on the Chinese market, and it focused on offering affordable vehicles for the masses. Moreover, since it used the same platform for more models, it could also lower the price of the car. From the outside, the Sunny Sedan sported curved lines and swept-back headlights that were extended over the front wheel fenders. Its V-shaped grille was part of the design language that Nissan tried to impose on the market, while the lower grille from the bumper gave a slight impression of a sporty vehicle, even though it was not the case. Even though it used an older platform, Nissan managed to create a roomy interior for up to five passengers. At the front, the flat seats didn't offer too much side support for their occupants, but after all, it was a regular family-oriented sedan. Fortunately, one of the most important features of the car was the trunk that could hold up to 505 liters (17.8 cu-ft) of luggage. In addition, the split-folding bench could extend that volume even more. Under the hood, the Chinese version of the Nissan Versa/Tiida Sedan was offered with a choice of two engines. Surprisingly, though, it even offered an automatic (CVT) version.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Sunny"",  ""year"": ""2010"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""affordable"", ""curved"", ""swept-back"", ""roomy"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""swept-back""],    ""grille"": [""V-shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [""lower grille""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""flat""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Cube,"Featuring an unique styling appealing to the younger, the Nissan Cube was a small spacious car designed for the small Japanese families. While the Cube shared its platform with the Nissan Micra, the small car offered lots of room, more than many mid-size cars had. Relatively comfortable, the Nissan Cube had a big bench in the back and the rear occupants benefited of plenty of headroom. However, legroom was limited. Inside, the Cube was nothing fancy, but featured lots of storage spaces even under the bench. Surpsingly, the front seats - well, actually, the two-person bench was fully reclinable and met the rear seats creating a giant chaise lounge. Probably the Cube made a good home too. Or, at least, not finding a room to book wasn’t such an issue. Not very powerful, but enough to make a good ride, the Cube was available with a CVT transmission that made the most of the engine. And it was also very economical in this combination. Around town, the Cube could keep up with the traffic, but taking it out on the highway was not a good idea. In Europe, the Cube was powered by a 1.5-liter diesel or a 1.6-liter gasoline engine. Different powertrains were available for other markets.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Nissan Cube"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""small, spacious"",  ""overall-design"": [""unique"", ""youthful"", ""spacious"", ""comfortable"", ""economical""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""small""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""spacious""],    ""roof"": [""roomy""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Ariya,"Nissan was a pioneer in electric mobility with the Leaf in 2010. Before that, a leader in the SUV market with the Qashqai. It might have waited for a while, but it finally combined these segments. Nissan Ariya was a concept car shown by the Japanese car-maker in 2019 at the Tokyo Motor Show and translated into a production vehicle in the following year. The series version looked almost the same as the concept car. The Ariya looked like it came from the future with its 24 LED lamps in the front for the headlights and the boomerang-style LED daytime running lights. The prominent black grille was a panel, but the apron's lower opening was used to cool the batteries and the motor. The SUV-coupe stance and the raked C-pillars made a good impression. It looked alive. A roof-spoiler was added to the back to enhance the look, if not the aerodynamic. Inside, the Ariya didn't share its parts with other products from its lineup. Two wide screens on the dashboard were used for the instrument panel and the infotainment system. There were touch-buttons with a haptic response on the wood-like trim that crossed the dashboard, but the volume knob for the sound system was regular. A voice recognition system similar to Amazon's Alexa was installed, and the updates for the system were made over the air, not requiring a visit to the dealer. The car featured a small gear selector and the touch-buttons for the drive mode on the center console. There was room for up to five adults, with a flat floor in the back. The Ariya was offered in a few versions for the powertrain, all-electric, with either rear or all-wheel-drive. There were a few options for the battery packs as well.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Nissan Ariya"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""SUV-coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""futuristic"", ""prominent"", ""raked"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""prominent"", ""black""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""boomerang-style""],    ""bumper"": [""lower opening""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""spoiler"", ""raked""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""enhancing"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
NISSAN Z,"Nissan didn’t wait too long before refreshing the seventh generation of the Z lineup and introduced the facelifted version of it in the Fall of 2023 for the 2024 model year. Like its non-facelifted sibling, this Z was not made for the European market, so customers from the Old Continent were left with tears in their eyes. But those who could enjoy it knew that the 2024 Z was a better car than its non-facelifted version. The Japanese automaker improved it in every possible way, starting from the exterior and moving onto the interior and ending with the power department. For the last one, though, there were some mixed feelings. The 2024 Z was available in three trim levels: Sport, Performance, and Nismo. There were some differences between these, with the first two featuring a shorter length since they didn’t have the same three-piece rear bumper nor the aggressive front splitter that was present on the top-spec version of the Z. In addition, the Sport was fitted with 18” forged alloy wheels, while the other two relied on 19” alloys, with unique Dunlop Sport MAXX tires for the Nismo. Furthermore, a bigger wing on the sportiest version confirmed the car’s track-oriented abilities. Also, there was a new set of taillights at the back of the 2024 Z featuring a new layout that made the car look wider. In addition, the Nismo had a red trim around the redesigned bumper and an ascending line towards the rear exhausts. Inside, like its predecessor, the Z featured an 8-inch touch-sensitive display for the infotainment system and a digital display for the instrument cluster. But, as an option, Nissan offered an advanced infotainment unit fitted with a larger, 9-inch touchscreen. All versions were fitted with sports bucket seats, but only the Nismo had the opportunity to boast a set of Recaro ones. Regardless of the trim level, all of them featured a tall center console that housed a pair of cup holders and the gear stick or gear selector. But the most significant upgrades happened under the car’s skin. There, Nissan added more braces under the front and rear axles and under the floor to make the car stiffer. As a result, it increased the Z’s rigidity by 2.5%. While that might not seem a lot, in reality, it transformed the vehicle. To compensate for the added stiffness and still be a comfortable vehicle on regular roads, the automaker re-tuned the dampers. Under the hood, all three versions were fitted with the same VR30DDTT 3.0L V6 twin-turbo engine as the 2022 Z, which generated 400 HP (406 PS) for the Sport and Performance and 420 HP (426 PS) for the Nismo variant. While the former two versions were available with a six-speed manual or a nine-speed automatic, the Nismo came exclusively with a two-pedal option, so no manual for the highest version of the 2024 Nissan Z.",NISSAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Nissan Z"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""sporty"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""track-oriented"", ""wide"", ""redesigned"", ""stiff""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""aggressive""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""new layout""],    ""bumper"": [""three-piece rear"", ""redesigned"", ""ascending line""],    ""wheel"": [""18” forged alloy"", ""19” alloys"", ""unique Dunlop Sport MAXX tires""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""bigger wing"", ""track-oriented""],    ""exhaust"": [""rear exhausts""]  }}```"
OPEL Corsa 5 Doors,"For the past forty years, the Opel Corsa has been a familiar sight on streets worldwide, being under various brand names like Vauxhall, Chevrolet, and Holden, and enhancing people's everyday lives. With the introduction of its seventh generation, the Corsa elevates the comfort and joy it brings customers through a technologically advanced experience and intuitive controls. In line with its ambitious goal of exclusively selling electric vehicles by 2028, Opel has embraced hybrid and fully electric versions of the new Corsa. The electric variant offers an impressive range of up to 250 miles (400 km) and boasts a rapid charging time of just 30 minutes, taking the battery from 20 to 80 percent. With a maximum output of 156 horsepower, the electric versions provide ample power for the car's everyday driving needs. The new Opel Corsa showcases impeccable proportions and meticulous attention to detail, and all encompassed within a confident and streamlined exterior design. The designers have propelled this beloved small car into the realms of modernity and style. An outstanding feature is the unmistakable Opel Vizor, the iconic face that graces all of Opel's latest models. This black visor seamlessly integrates the Corsa's front, merging the vehicle grille, LED headlights, and central Opel Blitz into a harmonious element. The brand logo, available in attention-grabbing black or matte satin silver, commands attention on both the front and rear, depending on the trim level. Notably, the enlarged and prominent optical air inlets in the lower front bumper area further enhance the vehicle's presence on the road. As an available feature, the new Corsa presents a fully digital cockpit powered by Snapdragon Cockpit Platforms from Qualcomm Technologies. This advanced setup includes intuitive infotainment and a vibrant, up to 10-inch color touchscreen, elevating the overall driving experience. Building upon the innovation introduced by the Corsa in 2019, the glare-free Intelli-Lux LED matrix light has been further improved, now equipped with 14 LED elements instead of 8, for extra precision and performance. The headlights have also been upgraded software-wise, being capable of cutting out incoming traffic better than before, ensuring a pleasant driving experience for all the traffic participants. By introducing a new, high-resolution panoramic rear-view camera, Opel Corsa is tailored to be the city car you didn't know you needed. The high-resolution camera captures detailed images, even in challenging lighting conditions, ensuring that no obstacle or potential hazard goes unnoticed. With its panoramic view, drivers can effortlessly maneuver in tight spaces, park precisely, and comprehensively understand the rear environment.

OPEL Grandland,"Opel revealed the refreshed 2021, Grandland crossover built on the same platform as its brother Peugeot 3008 and showed a serious visual upgrade. Sometimes, a carmaker manages to unveil a facelift that looks like a wholly new generation but still calls it a refresh since most of its underpinnings are the same as on the non-facelifted version. That's the case with the 2021 Grandland, which jumped from the modest-looking 2017 model to an exciting 2021 model. Since most customers are looking at a car's front fascia when they want to buy one, Opel designers mainly focused on that area. It kept the same 90 degrees LED daytime running lights pattern but with a sharper look. Its 168 LED headlights (84 per lamp) and black front panel mimicked the face of an electric vehicle. A new grille-mounted in the lower side of the bumper took the cooling job, which sported a 3D pattern and a lower lip spoiler. A pair of vertical air-intakes on the sides gave the crossover a sportier look. At the back, Opel designers look like they lost their appetite for changing and installed slightly redesigned taillights with LEDs and placed wide chromed lettering on the tailgate with the ""Grandland"" word. Inside, there was a new dashboard design with two displays. The touch-screen that sat on top of the center was for the infotainment system, while the up to 10"" LCD in front of the driver served as an instrument panel. Like its predecessor, the seats were certified by the ""Aktion Gesunder Rücken e.V."" (campaign for healthy backs) for their ergonomic shape. Under the hood, Opel carried over drivetrains from Peugeot-Citroen. It also featured a hybrid system that used the internal combustion engine to power the front wheels and an electric motor for the rear axle.",OPEL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Grandland"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""exciting"", ""sharp"", ""sporty"", ""ergonomic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""3D"", ""sharp"", ""sporty""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""sharper""],    ""bumper"": [""black"", ""lower lip spoiler""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
OPEL Astra 5 Doors,"In 2021, Opel opened the sixth chapter of the Astra's book, but, unlike its predecessors, it didn't share its platform with other GM products since it had already joined the Stellantis group together with its new owners, PSA (Peugeot-Citroen). Since it used the EMP2 platform used by Peugeot for the 308 lineup, which was available as an electric version, it was only a matter of time before the Astra could offer an electron-powered version. That came in late 2022 in the form of Astra Electric, which was available in two bodywork versions: a five-door hatchback and a station wagon. The latter was traditionally named Sports Tourer. The all-electric version sported a similar shape as the rest of the Astra range. It shared a slightly modified version of the new Opel Vizor front fascia, albeit it didn't have the slats needed to cool the engine since it didn't have an IAC. The car's profile revealed an angular shape with an up-kick for the C-pillar, with the A- and B-pillars blacked out. At the back, the lower bumper was slightly different since it didn't have to conceal an exhaust tip. Inside, the carmaker installed a fully digital Pure Panel with two large 10-inch widescreen displays. The dashboard's minimalist design and the center console's clean lines were part of Opel's design philosophy. The 2023 Astra Electric featured a pair of ergonomic Active Sports seats, optionally wrapped in Alcantara, which promised a comfortable ride and good side support for their occupants. In the back, a split-folding bench provided room for three adults.

OPEL Mokka,"After being purchased by the French group PSA, Opel started to revive its lineup with re-badged products, but with some specific details for the German brand. The Opel Mokka-e was just an example. Crossovers were designed for those who needed them to drive on unpaved roads, but they became a fashion item. It was the same situation with smartphones. The Mokka was a small crossover based on the Opel Corsa platform but enhanced with higher ground clearance and a 4x4 traction. In 2020, the Mokka-e became an urban SUV with a battery pack under the floor and front-wheel-drive only. Opel designed the Mokka-e on the same platform with the electric version of the Peugeot 2008. The result was different. Moreover, not even the wheelbase was the same for both cars. The Mokka looked like it received the better treatment, even if the 2008 was not a bad deal at all. The slim headlights and the chromed and curved line on the sides made the Mokka look better than most of its competitors, not to mention its predecessors. Inside, the Mokka was fitted as standard with a 7” display for the instrument cluster, but higher trim levels featured a 12” TFT for the driver and an additional 10” touch-screen for the infotainment unit. A glass panel covered both screens. Due to its decent wheelbase and the lack of a center tunnel, the Opel Mokka offered good legroom for the rear passengers and it was suitable for the headroom. The trunk was marginally smaller than the one found on its predecessor, but it was more than decent for an urban vehicle. The motor was the same 100 kW (136 hp) from the Peugeot 2008. It was fed by a 50 kWh battery pack and offered a decent range of 324 km (201 miles).",OPEL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Opel Mokka-e"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""small urban SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""fashionable"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""compact"", ""stylish""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""slim""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""enhanced with higher ground clearance""],    ""headlights"": [""slim""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""different from Peugeot 2008""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
OPEL Zafira,"The Opel Zafira Life was first introduced in January 2019 as a replacement for the Opel Zafira C and comes in 3 size versions, namely 4.61 m long ( S ), 4.96 m long ( M ) and 5.31 m long ( L ). Unlike its predecessors (Zafira A, B, and C), the new Opel Zafira Life is quite larger in all aspects, allowing up to nine people to travel safely - the Zafira Life has received the maximum five stars from Euro NCAP. For all three versions, Opel Zafira Life comes with leather seats on aluminum rails that allow smooth adjustment. Zafira Life S comes with the option of folding back the front passenger seat allowing the transportation of objects up to 3.50 m in length. Also, folding the third-row seats increases the luggage capacity to 1,500-liters. Furthermore, the total cargo capacity can be increased to as much as 3,397-liters by removing the rear seats, making it very spacious. In regards to safety, the new Opel Zafira Life features a wide range of driver assistance systems, including a camera and radar that are monitoring the front of the car and can recognize pedestrians crossing the road. It then initiates an emergency braking manoeuver at speeds up to 30km/h, reducing the speed to 20km/h.",OPEL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Opel Zafira Life"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""Larger than predecessors"",  ""overall-design"": [""Spacious"", ""Safe"", ""Modern"", ""Adjustable"", ""Versatile""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""Folding"", ""Spacious""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
OPEL Insignia,"Premiering at the 2020 Brussels Motor Show, the revamped Opel Insignia Grand Sport has been substantially refreshed both in terms of looks and the amount of technology available on the mid-size model. The main exterior modifications are found at the front, where extremely slim headlights with LED technology provide a major upgrade over the previous model. The adaptive IntelliLux LED Pixel Light technology no offers no less than 84 LED elements per each headlamp, up from the previous model's 16, which means that the lights react a lot faster and with a lot more precision at any change in direction of driving without blinding the oncoming cars. This feature alone makes the revamped Insignia Grand Sport a unique proposition in its segment. The new radiator grille has a wider chrome edge, while the horizontal slats are more prominent, and alongside the new headlamp clusters and air inlets with integrated fog lamps make the car appear wider when viewed from the front. At the rear, the under guard panel now features two slim slots instead of round holes for the exhaust pipes, overall giving the car a cleaner look. As for the interior, the refreshed Insignia keeps the ergonomically certified AGR seats, which are still available for the driver and front passenger.",OPEL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Opel Insignia Grand Sport"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""clean"", ""prominent""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wider"", ""prominent"", ""chrome""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""extremely slim"", ""LED"", ""adaptive"", ""IntelliLux"", ""84 LED elements""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""cleaner look""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""slim slots"", ""cleaner look""]  }}```"
OPEL Astra Sports Tourer,"In late 2022, Opel unveiled the electric version of the Astra's sixth generation, in both shapes as a compact hatchback or a station wagon, traditionally named Sports Tourer. After Peugeot-Citroen bought the German automaker from GM, it shared the platforms among the brands. Thus, Opel received the EMP2 base used for the Peugeot 308 and built the Astra on it starting in 2021. Later on, in 2022, it unveiled an all-electric version of its famous vehicle on the European market in the form of the Astra Electric and Astra Sports Tourer Electric, respectively. One of the things that the new owner didn't want to change was the brand identity, and that was clearly viewed on the Astra's front fascia. Thus, the so-called ""Opel Visor"" was carried over from the already-launched Opel Mokka. Unlike its IAC-powered brother, the Electric version didn't sport the same air inlets at the front since it didn't need them. Like its 5-door sibling, the Sports Tourer shared most of its body panels with the rest of the Astra's range. Yet, the rear bumper was slightly different, with a narrower diffuser underneath the rear bumper. Inside, the carmaker installed a fully digital Pure Panel with two large 10-inch widescreen displays. The dashboard's minimalist design and the center console's clean lines were part of Opel's design philosophy. The 2023 Astra Sports Tourer Electric didn't lose any of its cargo capabilities since the battery pack was mounted underneath the floor. Thus, it could provide 516 liters (18.2 cu-ft) of space with the rear bench up or 1,553 liters (54.8 cu-ft) with the backseats folded down.",OPEL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Astra"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""electric"", ""minimalist"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sleek""],    ""grille"": [""Opel Visor""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""digital""],    ""bumper"": [""narrower"", ""functional""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""narrower""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
OPEL Combo,"Opel introduced the fifth generation of the Combo in 2018 based on the same platform as the French Citroen Berlingo and Peugeot Partner/Rifter. While Opel built the first three generations of the Combo on its platforms, the fourth was a badge-engineered Fiat Doblo, one of the best-selling MPVs on its segment in Europe. For the fifth generation, things went differently after PSA (Peugeot-Citroen) bought the German carmaker. Thus, the 2018 Combo was a re-badged Citroen Berlingo-Peugeot Partner. Like its French siblings, the 2018 Combo didn't look like a utility vehicle anymore. Even though it sported vertical side panels and a steep windshield, it looked more suitable to host people inside in e field trip than to a construction site. At the front, Opel designers made a broad grille with the company's logo on the upper side. The plastic bumper was tall and, on its lower side, it featured a trapezoidal grille flanked by two scoops where the carmaker installed the fog lights. Inside, the Combo featured an interior inspired by the furniture world, and the designers made the cabin to be functional. Also, they took greater care of the material's quality, especially for the upper trim levels. Since the platform is the same as the one from a passenger car, the ride was smoother. The available engines were a 1.2-liter gasoline engine with 110 hp mated to a 6-speed manual gearbox and another 1.2-liter turbo with 130 hp paired to an 8-speed automatic transmission. For diesel fans, there was also a 1.5 liter in three outputs versions: 75 hp, 100 hp, and 130 hp, respectively.",OPEL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Opel Combo"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""functional"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""steep""],    ""grille"": [""broad""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""vertical""],    ""bumper"": [""tall"", ""plastic""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
OPEL Ampera,"After a not-so-good start with the original Opel Ampera, the German carmaker tried again with a completely different car that retained the same nameplate. Designed as a compact hatchback, the Ampera-e was the re-badged American Chevrolet Bolt EV. While the original five-door hatchback featured a gasoline-powered range extender, which also turned the wheels at higher speeds, the Ampera-e was exclusively electric. Its narrow front grille and angular, swept-back headlights made the car look aggressive. In the apron, the carmaker installed a broad grille mainly for aesthetic purposes than functional since there was no internal combustion engine under the hood, and the motor and the batteries didn’t require such a large cooling area. From its sides, the ascending beltline was emphasized by a sloped, upward step toward the C-pillar. At the back, a roof-spoiler adorned the tailgate, while the horizontally-mounted taillights tried to make the car looks wider. Inside, Opel placed its bets on the innovation card and removed the analog dials from the instrument cluster. It replaced them with a TFT screen. As for the infotainment system, it featured an additional touch-screen mounted on the upper side of the center stack, above the climate control buttons. On the center console, Opel placed the gear lever. Since the car didn’t feature a gearbox, it was more like a drive selector. The carmaker looked like it learned from the original Ampera mistakes and introduced better materials in the cockpit. Still, the fake leather and hard plastic spoiled the hatchback’s sci-fi look. The powertrain provided a whooping 204 hp motor, which propelled the car to 60 mph (97 kph) in 7.3 seconds, which was already hot-hatch territory. The battery pack provided 60kWh of energy, enough to move the car for 520 km (323 miles).",OPEL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Opel Ampera-e"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""compact hatchback"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""innovative"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""swept-back""],    ""grille"": [""narrow"", ""broad"", ""aesthetic""],    ""hood"": [""n/a""],    ""headlights"": [""angular"", ""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [""n/a""],    ""wheel"": [""n/a""],    ""doors"": [""n/a""],    ""roof"": [""spoiler"", ""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [""n/a""],    ""spoiler"": [""roof-spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": [""n/a""]  }}```"
OPEL Corsa OPC,"While most of the automotive manufacturers had already released their sportier versions, the Corsa OPC was the last to be unveiled to the public. With technology borrowed from the Opel Adam R2 rally car, the OPC featured a 1.6-liter turbo engine that cranked out 204 hp and 181 lb.-ft of torque. In the sprint to 100 kph, the Corsa Opc took around 7 seconds and the top speed was rated at 228 km/h. The aggressive look of the exterior design made it pretty clear that the sporty Corsa was a fast hot hatch. A performance package was available and added 18-inch alloys instead of the standard 17-inch wheels, a sportier suspension that somehow compromised comfort and a Drexler differential lock for better grip. With so many rivals on the market, the Clio RS seemed to offer a more refined ride, with the Fiesta ST was more playful on the road. The Corsa OPC felt heavy for its size and drifting was not among the list of games to play with it. The sporty feeling inside the cabin was mostly given by the Recaro seats, whereas the dashboard and the steering wheel were not very different from the regular Corsa. The quality of the materials used was not the best, but looked well overall. More expensive than most of the competitors available at the time, the Opc’s price started at around $30,000 and the Performance Package was an additional $1,800.",OPEL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Corsa OPC"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""sporty"", ""fast"", ""hot hatch""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""aggressive""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""sporty""],    ""wheel"": [""18-inch alloys""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
OPEL Corsa 3 Doors,"The fifth generation of the Opel Corsa marked its debut at the 2014 Paris Motor Show. It was the last Corsa generation completely developed by the German car-maker before it was taken over by PSA (Peugeot-Citroen). After almost 12 million units sold in 32 years, the Corsa was a big success from the German car-maker. The fifth-generation grew in size to 4.02 meters (158.3”) from the initial 3.62 m (142.6”) length of the first generation in 1982. It also grew in features and performances. The front fascia was characterized by the “wing” shaped headlights, which incorporated the Opel's signature and LED daytime running lights. The sporty trapezoidal grille featured the chromed Opel badge. A lip-spoiler was installed on the lower part of the apron, and two side air-intakes hosted the fog-lights (if mounted). An arched rear side window amplified the sporty look of the three-door version. The sculptured doors and rear fenders made the car look longer. Inside, the car featured five seats, but with limited access to the rear seats. On the base models, the dashboard was simple and plain, with a center stack where the radio and climate controls were installed. The instrument cluster was simple and easy to read. On higher trim levels, a new infotainment unit was installed with a 7” touch-screen. It featured connectivity with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The car offered a wide choice of diesel and gasoline engines. Depending on the power version, it was available with a 5- or 6-speed manual fitted as standard. A 6-speed automatic or 5-speed automated gearbox was on the options list.

OPEL Insignia Sports Tourer,"Opel unveiled the second generation of the Insignia Sports Tourer in 2017 at the Belgrade Motor Fair Trade, an unusual location to show its vehicle. The German carmaker was ready to storm the dealers' network with the Insignia, and the Sports Tourer was one of the most important versions in the lineup. There were not too many station wagon vehicles left on the market, and Opel tried to convince its customers that the car was more than just an Insignia with a bigger trunk. The Insignia Sports Tourer showed the same front fascia as its sedan version, with a broad grille that supported a pair of wings and the round badge. At the lower side of the bumper, the carmaker installed chromed accents on top of the fog lamps and a lower trapezoidal grille under the license plate. On the sides, the aerodynamically profiled sills and the sculptured line that crossed the door onto the quarter panels enhanced the car's dynamic view. Its raked forward tailgate and the roof-spoiler showed an appetite for long journeys and sporty driving. Inside, the high-bolstered seats promised good lateral support during high cornering speeds, while the ""zero-gravity"" design tried to keep the occupants rested even after long hours. Its split-folding rear bench transformed the trunk into a cavernous storage area, among the mid-size segment's biggest. Opel offered the Insignia Sports Tourer a choice of three gasoline and one turbo-diesel engines under the hood.",OPEL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Insignia Sports Tourer"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""dynamic"", ""sporty"", ""aerodynamic"", ""sculptured"", ""elegant""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""chromed"", ""trapezoidal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""lower"", ""chromed""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [""raked"", ""spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
OPEL Astra Sedan,"The Opel Astra Sedan was launched at the 2012 Moscow International Automobile Salon. Its siblings with three or five doors were already on the market since 2009. While the compact-class was dominated by hatchback vehicles, Opel saw a big interest in the sedan-segment in the East European market. After a good experience with the Opel Astra Sedan H, it introduced the three-box version in the Russian market and, later on, that year, it extended it into other markets where that kind of bodyworks was attractive for customers. The Astra J, or the fourth generation of the compact Opel, the sedan was similar to the 5-door hatchback up to the B-pillar. The roofline descended behind the rear seats to the trunk lid. The rear taillights featured the same design language with the headlights and were different than those installed on the 5-door version. Inside, while the front seats and dashboard were the same with the 2009 Astra lineup, the rear seats were different and offered slightly more room for the rear passengers. The trunk was opened from the keyfob or via a dedicated button on the trunk. The Astra Sedan featured different engines, depending on the market. It was sold under the name Buick Excelle GT in China or Buick Verano on the North American Continent.",OPEL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Opel Astra Sedan"",  ""year"": ""2012"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""compact"", ""three-box"", ""similar to hatchback""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""same design language as taillights""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""three-box design""],    ""roof"": [""descended roofline""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
OPEL Astra OPC,"Based on the Astra GTC, the OPC version was the sportiest model in its range and, when it was launched, it was one of the most powerful hot-hatches. The compact hot-hatch market evolved from power to look factor. When Vauxhall/Opel understood that, it made the GTC model, a sportier version of the Astra. But it did some more! While it had some predecessors with sporty engines, it installed it only on the GTC version, which was more of a coupe rather than a regular hatchback. On the outside, the OPC took the same bodywork from the GTC version but improved it with a more aggressive body kit. A larger front spoiler, more profiled side sills and a roof-spoiler in the back completed the image of a “bad-boy-racer”. A twin exhaust in the back with chromed tips was offered to amplify the sporty image. Moreover, an option for aerodynamic package added a second spoiler over the roof-spoiler. Inside, there was the regular Astra dashboard with some OPC badges on the gear-stick lever and the flat-bottom steering wheel. They also redesigned the dials, which were lit in red when the OPC mode was engaged. But the most attention was attracted by the sport-bucket seats with holes in the integrated headrest, like those for race harnesses. For the drivetrain, the OPC retained the same struts in the front and DeWatt linkage in the rear, but with adaptive dampers. Power came from a 280 hp engine and went to the front wheels via a 6-speed manual and, most important, through a mechanical limited-slip differential.",OPEL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Astra GTC OPC"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""aggressive"", ""coupe-like"", ""aerodynamic"", ""powerful""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""larger""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""more aggressive""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof-spoiler"", ""twin exhaust"", ""chromed tips"", ""aerodynamic package""],    ""exhaust"": [""twin"", ""chromed""],  }}```"
OPEL Crossland,"After being taken over by the French Group PSA (Peugeot-Citroen), Opel received access to new platforms that were used for new vehicles, such as the 2020 Crossland. The small crossover car-category started to be bigger and bigger in Europe. They replaced most of the small-class station-wagons and some minivans. The higher ground clearance and the interior space made them more suitable for most of the families, even for out-of-city trips. The Crossland was built on the same platform with the Peugeot 2008 and Citroen C3 Aircross. The design team tried to hide the links with a bodywork that resembled the Mokka. Both bumpers featured silver-colored plastic skid-plates at the bottom, which contrasted the black aprons. A black grille surrounded by the bumper's upper side and the Astra-inspired headlights completed a true, Opel image. With its short hood and arched and long greenhouse, the Crossland offered a sense of floating roofline. The instrument cluster featured round, analog dials, with a small display between the tachometer and speedometer. Most of the space was occupied by the infotainment display on the center stack, which was Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatible. Opel insisted on keeping its seats, certified as one of the most comfortable in its class. The five-seat interior offered enough room for five adults. The rear bench had a split-folding seat-back to extend the trunk room from 410 up to 1255 liters. Under the hood, Opel offered the Crossland with a choice of diesel and gasoline engines, ranged between 83 hp and 130 hp. Both manual and automatic transmissions were available. A particular traction-control system allowed the car to tackle some unpaved roads and slippery surfaces, but it was front-wheel-drive only.",OPEL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Crossland"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""small crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""compact"", ""modern"", ""functional"", ""sleek"", ""practical""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""arched"", ""angled""],    ""grille"": [""black"", ""Astra-inspired""],    ""hood"": [""short""],    ""headlights"": [""Astra-inspired""],    ""bumper"": [""silver-colored"", ""plastic skid-plates""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""floating""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
OPEL Adam,"The smallest car Opel produced was the Opel Adam, an A segment vehicle that was a statement of style and personalisation. The Adam came as a response to the Fiat’s 500 and Opel decided to beat it at its own game. The cabin of the Adam was roomy enough, fitted with high quality materials and lots of good taste included for a car in this segment. The instrument cluster was refined and looked even better than in the other Opel models. The seats in the front were good and decent in the back, as the rear seats were not suitable for tall adults. The trunk space was small, with only 170 L available, however, the rear seats were foldable, thus users could increase the load area if necessary. The Adam used the Intelli-Link infotainment system that wasn’t available for the most mini cars. The highly customisable Adam was available in 3 models: Slam, Glam and Jam. Unlike any other in the class, it was available with 12 body exterior paint colors, 3 roof color options and 31 alloy wheels models, reason why chances of seeing an identical Adam was at 1 in 30.000. The car could run on 18-inch alloys as well, thus compromising comfort for a better look. The engine on the Adam was a 1.4-liter naturally aspirated engine developing 100 HP. Although it was an older generation, the power plant offered reduced fuel consumption. A start-stop system was also included int he package. The mini car could reach 100 kph in 11.5 seconds, and while it may not sound good, remember that the Adam was mostly designed to serve as an economical city car. While raising the standard in the mini cars category, the Adam was more expensive, with a price around $17.000.",OPEL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Opel Adam"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""stylish"", ""customisable"", ""roomy"", ""high-quality"", ""economical""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""refined""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""18-inch alloys""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""customisable"", ""3 color options""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
OPEL Cascada,"After several generations of compact Kadett and Astra cabriolets, Opel returns to an older tradition of prestigious mid-size, four-seat convertibles from the 50’s and 60’s with the new Cascada. With the new convertible, Opel aims to go side by side with premium brand convertibles such as Audi, BMW, or VW. On the exterior, we got a broad stance and a flowing continuity of sculpted shapes. With its top down, the car has a perfectly clean profile, with no visible roof-top covers and a raked A-pillar. The front end looks sporty, having a bulged bonnet, chrome insertions, sharp-angled headlights, and honeycombed grills. LED technology is used both for headlights and tail-lights. The rear end is simple and sharp, with a small boot-lid that incorporates the tail-lights. The soft top is nice too, having an aerodynamic shape and being built using top-quality materials. It benefits from a high level of acoustic and thermal isolation thanks to a special polyester fleece layer between the outside layer and the interior lining. The interior offers a striking sculptural yet sporty design, with lines from the wing-shaped instrument panel flowing into the doors. At the wheel, where you sit quite high up, the cabin offers a mixture of an Opel-styled dash, you get an over-buttoned center console similar found in an Astra or an Insignia. The AGR-certified ergonomic seats are wrapped in soft Nappa leather and benefit from heating and ventilation systems. Opel Cascada has great storage capacity for a convertible, benefiting from storage spaces in the doors, instrument panels, and even in the central console. And speaking about luggage, the boot has a capacity of 350 liters when the soft-top is up and 280 when it is folded. Thanks to long doors, access to the two rear seats is easy for a medium-sized adult. The Easy Entry system makes it easier when the front seats fold and slide with a single lever pull. Once in place, most adults should feel quite comfortable. Enough with common details, let's talk about the specific one. The Opel Cascada's soft-top, which opens in 17 seconds, can be operated at speeds of up to 30mph, which is useful and helpful in the event of sudden rain. When the top is down, there's no visible roof-top cover or roll-over protection to clutter the car's lines. They are well hidden and activated only in case of collision. Performance and comfort are decent. The petrol engines are smooth and quiet in normal driving unless you are not the 1.4-liter owner, which is a bit lazy and unresponsive if you are looking for a sporty drive. The turbodiesel is a somehow noisier and delivers a few more vibrations than the petrol engines, but it's more powerful and economical. Road noise in all is nicely suppressed in both cases with the up or down. As standard, the Cascada comes with a dual-layered roof. It has an option of a triple-layered acoustic roof, which not only keeps the cabin warmer in winter (and cooler in summer) but does damp out outside noises even further. A wind deflector you manually put up is standard on Elite models and optional on the SE. The price spent on the Cascada is more than you wish for. The catchy design and the German-style engineering make it a good choice for cabrio buyers. It is not as you'd expect to be like an Audi, Volvo or BMW. But tends to give that premium-class feeling. Some might even find this car to be better looking.",OPEL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Opel Cascada"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""prestigious"", ""sporty"", ""clean profile"", ""aerodynamic"", ""striking""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""honeycombed""],    ""hood"": [""bulged""],    ""headlights"": [""sharp-angled"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""long"", ""easy access""],    ""roof"": [""soft-top"", ""no visible cover"", ""aerodynamic shape""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
OPEL Rocks-e,"After GM sold its European branch, Opel, to Peugeot-Citroen, the carmaker adapted the German products according to the French technologies. At the beginning of 2020, Citroen introduced an urban electric vehicle, the Ami. It was designed for commuting inside towns. In 2021, Opel received permission to sell the same vehicle under its badge. The result was named Rocks-e. When it comes to cost-cutting, the French engineers are experts. They designed the car with the minimum required part. For instance, the front panel and the back panel of the vehicle are using the same molds. The car’s bodywork was made from fiber-glass and plastic, which is easier to build and completely reusable. Moreover, even the doors are using the same stamps. That’s why the one placed next to the sidewalk was rear-hinged. Inside the four-wheeled umbrella, the carmaker installed two plastic seats, similar to those installed in public transport vehicles. There was only a minimal instrument cluster, which showed the speed and the battery level. On top of the dashboard, in the middle, the carmaker placed a cradle for a mobile phone. Thus, the user could listen to its music on the car's speakers, or follow the navigation app installed on the smartphone. Since it was a city-commuter vehicle, ideal for ride-sharing or pay-per-use apps, the Rocks-e featured an electric motor and a 5.5 kWh battery pack. The carmaker considered that its 75 km (46 miles) range was enough for the vehicle, and the battery pack could have been charged from zero to 100% in 3.5 hours at any standard household socket.",OPEL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Rocks-e"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""urban electric vehicle"",  ""overall-design"": [""minimalist"", ""urban"", ""cost-effective""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""shared molds for front and back panel""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""rear-hinged"", ""using same stamps""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
OPEL Insignia OPC,"Even though it was facing an uncertain future, with negotiations being held between General Motors and the Russian Economic Bank – Sberbank, Opel remained true to its customers and offered the OPC version The three letters meant more performance for, otherwise, normal daily drivers. Most of the Opel products had an OPC version, for those who didn't want just a regular car. And it wasn't only about the performance. A part of the modifications was made to the car's appearance. The Insignia OPC featured a bigger front bumper with a lower apron and big air-intakes in the middle and on the sides, with satin-silver color for the grille and side scoops. A set of big, 19” light-alloy wheels was installed. The ground clearance was reduced with 10 mm (0.4”) than the standard version. In the back, the redesigned bumper revealed two large exhausts on the sides. When compared with the standard Insignia, the OPC featured sport-bucket seats and standard leather upholstery. On top of the center stack, the manufacturer installed a standard color monitor for the infotainment system, which included the navigation as well. The powertrain offered a twin-turbo V6 engine mated to a standard six-speed gearbox. The all-wheel-drive system featured a Haldex center and an electronic limited-slip rear differential. For higher cornering speed, the car featured adaptive dampers. A Brembo disc-brakes system was fitted as standard.",OPEL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Opel Insignia OPC"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""aggressive"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""performance-oriented""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""satin-silver""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""bigger"", ""lower"", ""redesigned""],    ""wheel"": [""big"", ""19-inch"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""large""]  }}```"
OPEL Adam Rocks,"It is funny to see a car from the mini-segment with touches of an off-roader. Yet, this type of crossovers conquered an important part of the market since they were effective against curbs and bumps on the road. Just don't take them seriously that they can handle rear forest tracks. The 15 cm (5.9"") of ground clearance tackles well only on the city speed bumps. The Opel Adam Rocks is the kind of vehicle that was built for the city and then someone thought it can look better on stilts. The black plastic on the wheel-arches, on the bumpers and the silver plastic underneath the car, suggest that the vehicle is ready to fight against shopping carts into your local supermarket parking lot. It is a car screaming for attention and its 17"" light-alloy wheels are on the pitch note. If some would want to scream louder, would choose the optional 18"" ones. Inside there is the same Adam, but not the standard version. It has a climate control unit, an infotainment system that can connect to a smartphone. The interior room is kind of cramped in the rear, at least for the leg-room. If needed, the Adam Rocks feature a soft-top fitted as standard that can be opened and give a view for the sky, but it is a car that attracts looks.",OPEL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Opel Adam Rocks"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""mini"",  ""overall-design"": [""off-roader touches"", ""city-oriented"", ""attention-grabbing"", ""compact"", ""stylish""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""black plastic"", ""ready for urban obstacles""],    ""wheel"": [""17\"" light-alloy wheels"", ""optional 18\"" wheels""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""soft-top fitted as standard"", ""openable for sky view""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
OPEL Insignia Sports Tourer GSi,"The second generation of the Insignia was unveiled at the International Motor Fair Trade in Belgrade. It was an unusual location for Opel to show its newest model. The first generation of the Insignia was unveiled at London Motor Show in 2008, right before the world financial crisis struck the global economy. Opel was on the edge and was very close to being bought by a Russian group of companies. In the end, it survived and moved on with the second generation of the Insignia, with a fresh, sporty, look. The Insignia Sports Tourer GSI was the sportiest version of the Insignia station-wagon. It featured a slightly different outside design. The front fascia was more aggressive. A black mesh was on the grille and, in the bumper, there were side air-scoops and a lower lip. On the sides, the aerodynamically profiled sills and the sculptured door panels amplified the sporty image of the car. In the back, two chromed exhaust tips and a roof-spoiler filled the GSI style. Inside, the alien-look of the sport-bucket seats promised great side support. In the rear, due to a long wheelbase, there was more than enough legroom for three passengers. The trunk was among the biggest in its class. The Insignia GSI was available with a gasoline or a diesel engine, both turbocharged and mated with an 8-speed automatic gearbox. The all-wheel-drive system was equipped with a torque vectoring aid, that helped the driver for high-speed cornering.",OPEL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Insignia"",  ""year"": ""second generation"",  ""size"": ""station-wagon"",  ""overall-design"": [""fresh"", ""sporty"", ""aggressive"", ""aerodynamic"", ""sculptured""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black mesh""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""side air-scoops"", ""lower lip""],    ""wheel"": [""long wheelbase""],    ""doors"": [""sculptured door panels""],    ""roof"": [""roof-spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof-spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": [""chromed""]  }}```"
OPEL Insignia GSi,"Opel brought back the GSI badge from the past and installed it on the second generation of the Insignia. It might be called a blast from the past, but the GSI badge always said something more to the Opel enthusiasts than the OPC one. Even though the fuel injection system was no longer a new technological achievement, Opel still relied on that badge to get to its fanbase's harts. Moreover, it didn't want to disappoint them. Built as a hatchback, the Insignia GSI distinguished itself from its brothers with a sportier, more aggressive styling. The silver rims on the side-scoops, the 3D mesh-grille, and the little wing in the back were signs of a sporty character. For high-speed cornering, Opel lowered the suspension by 10 mm (0.4"") compared to a regular version. Opel designed a new set of sport-bucket seats with integrated headrests for the front passengers. They were specially made for the Insignia GSI and not available for the rest of the range. As an exclusive standard feature, the leather-upholstered interior sported contrast stitching. But the Insignia GSI was also a practical vehicle. Its trunk could have been expanded from 490 liters (17.3 cu-ft) to 1,450 liters (51.2 cu-ft) by folding the rear bench seatback. Under the hood, Opel installed a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine that provided less power than the previous Insignia OPC and claimed that the car was faster on the Nurburgring race track by 10 seconds, thanks to its lower weight and better mass distribution. The all-wheel-drive system featured a dual-clutch for the rear axle controlled by a computer and mimicked an LSD.",OPEL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Insignia GSI"",  ""year"": ""second generation"",  ""size"": ""hatchback"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""aggressive"", ""exclusive"", ""practical"", ""fast""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""3D mesh""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""silver rims""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""little wing""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual-clutch""]  }}```"
OPEL Insignia Country Tourer,"After the success recorded by other car-maker with lifted station-wagons, Opel re-worked its large Insignia Sports Tourer and gave it a rugged-ish look. The Insignia was introduced to the market in 2008 and the station-wagon version was named Sports Tourer. It was a replacement for the Vectra and Signum as well. It could have been a fleet car, a family car, or an executive vehicle, depending on the options. The Country Tourer version was addressed for families who want to go out with bikes and tents in remote areas where are no roads. The Country Tourer was raised-up by 20 mm (0.8”). Opel has included anthracite-colored protective cladding on the side sills and lower body, to lend the wheel-arches a more pronounced and flared appearance. Tinted headlights with LED daytime running lights were fitted as standard. The taillights were LEDs as well. On top of the car, the Country Tourer featured roof rails nicely curved to the back. Inside, the Insignia Country Tourer featured the same interior as in a regular, but in a higher trim level, Insignia Sports Tourer. The infotainment system was offered as standard. It supported Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity along with Bluetooth. Since the car was designed for outdoor activities, a rubber mat was on the options list for the big trunk area. The Country Tourer was offered exclusively as an all-wheel-drive vehicle. It was offered with a choice of three turbocharged engines, both diesel, and gasoline.",OPEL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Insignia Sports Tourer"",  ""year"": ""2008"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged-ish look"", ""raised-up"", ""anthracite-colored protective cladding"", ""tinted headlights"", ""LED taillights"", ""roof rails""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""tinted"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""curved roof rails""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PAGANI Utopia,"Utopia is a place that doesn't exist, and yet Horacio Pagani created one, but instead of being a country is a hypercar that broke the covers in 2022. Pagani was no longer a new car manufacturer on the market when it introduced the Utopia since it had already gathered three decades of development of unique vehicles. But if there is one thing that didn't change over that time was the use of Mercedes-AMG engines and the wish to create desirable hypercars that also boasted a luxurious ambiance. The 2022 Utopia was designed with a hypercar shape, based on state-of-the-art technologies carefully hidden under the beautiful bodywork. At the front, the car featured a quad-headlamp look and a broad air intake that also incorporated the foglamps neatly attached to an aerodynamic horizontal slat. The car's profile revealed the bubble-like greenhouse with a sloped-down roofline. In addition, the manufacturer chose to install a split window on the vehicle's roof, which was quite unusual. Finally, at the back, the quad-exhaust specific for Pagani vehicles exited in the upper mid-section of the rear panel. Inside, the automaker used only expensive, carefully crafted materials to adorn the cabin. The analog dials from the instrument cluster were separated by a TFT display that showed information from the onboard computer regarding the car's functions. In addition, four other gauges mounted on the center stack displayed the oil's temperature and pressure, the water temperature, and the turbocharger pressure. Behind the cabin, the Utopia featured a 6.0-liter V12 powerplant built by Mercedes-AMG. The twin-turbocharging system provided 864 hp (876 PS) and a massive 1,100 Nm (811 lb-ft) of torque sent to the rear wheels via a seven-speed manual transmission.",PAGANI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Utopia"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""hypercar"",  ""overall-design"": [""hypercar shape"", ""luxurious ambiance"", ""bubble-like greenhouse"", ""sloped-down roofline"", ""expensive, carefully crafted materials""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""bubble-like"", ""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""quad-headlamp"", ""neatly attached foglamps""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""split window""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""quad-exhaust specific""]  }}```"
PAGANI Huayra,"In 2012, Pagani launched the lightest supercar in its class. Actually, to call the Huayra a supercar would be an understatement since its performance recommends it as a hypercar. The 700 hp and 1000 Nm (737 lb-ft) of torque can sprint the car to 100 kph (62 mph) in under 3.5 seconds and gave it a top speed of 360 kph (224 mph). But not only the sprint and the top speed makes a vehicle a hypercar. It is the story behind it and the technologies involved. The Huayra was designed in 5 years. The bodywork required countless CAD designs, eight scale models, two 1:1 models and five prototypes for testing. The entire car was drawn and redrawn, with new elements and high-tech materials. The carbon-fiber was not enough. So they made the Carbon-fiber-titanium elements. The front and rear subframes are made of CrMo (chrome-molybdenum). Inside the high-tech bodywork, in the cockpit, a central console machined from one single aluminum block hosts multiple controls, including those for the heating and AC unit. The high central touchscreen of the vehicle infotainment controls audio functions, satellite navigation. A secondary screen controls vehicle functions and Bluetooth phone. And there is the engine. An engineering V12 masterpiece. Each is hand-crafted in the AMG factory and signed by the engineer who built it. The 6-liter twin-turbo is crafted to maximum perfection. And it is mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox which sends the energy flux to the rear. Because that engine doesn't send power or torque. It sends pure energy.",PAGANI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Huayra"",  ""year"": ""2012"",  ""size"": ""lightest in class"",  ""overall-design"": [""high-tech"", ""aerodynamic"", ""sleek"", ""performance-oriented"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""sleek"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""headlights"": [""high-tech""],    ""bumper"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""wheel"": [""high-tech""],    ""doors"": [""luxurious""],    ""roof"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""diffusor"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""spoiler"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""exhaust"": [""high-performance""]  }}```"
PAGANI Imola,"After storming the hypercar world with its previous models, Pagani came back in 2020 with full force, baptizing its latest model with one of the best known names in the motorsport world: Imola. Like the Imola track, the new Pagani model will be loved or hated, but never underestimated. The new hypercar covered more then 10.000 miles (16.800 km) in testing to prove that the car is road and race worthy. This distance is about three times longer than the 24h of Le Mans race. Judging by the look, most of people might say that this is a re-worked Huayra with carbon fiber and different wheels. But this is due to some design signatures that Horacio Pagani insisted to keep. The dual-lense headlights, like two teardrops on each front fender, the ants-antennas look for the rear-view mirrors and the quad grouped exhausts rear in the middle are already signatures for this extraordinary manufacturer. Under the hood, the Pagani Imola comes with a twin-turbocharged Mercedes-AMG V12 engine. With a 6.0-liter displacement, the powerhouse develops no less than 827 HP and 1100 Nm (813 lb-ft) of torque. To cope with this massive engine, Pagani installed a 7-speed transverse automated gearbox and an electro-mechanical rear differential. The main structure of the Imola is a special alloy made of carbon and titanium so the total mass of the Pagani is kept well under control: 2747 lbs (1246 kg).",PAGANI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Imola"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""hypercar"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""aerodynamic"", ""sleek"", ""distinctive"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""carbon-fiber""],    ""headlights"": [""dual-lense"", ""teardrop-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""different"", ""signature""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""quad-grouped""]  }}```"
PAGANI Zonda F,"Released in 2005 at the Geneva Motor Show, the Pagani Zonda F was a good mix between safety, luxury and performance. Considered the first car to feature an exclusive natural carbon fibre bodywork, the Zonda F was also fitted with an extremely powerful V12 Mercedes engine. Similar in design with the Honda S 7.3, the F featured slight changes as the repositioned side mirrors, refreshed lower rear vents and a new vent added on the top of the rear quarter. At the rear, the F features a single piece spoiler instead of the usual two-piece unit Pagani used us with. The interior was unexpectedly luxurious resembling designs paired with ultra luxurious vehicles such as Bentley or Rolls Royce. Red leather with diamond quilted patterns used for the chairs and the floorboard, as well as leather accents on the steering wheel combined with wood trims. While the F was offered with a 7.3-liter V12 unit, it was available with two different power options: 602 hp or 650 hp, the latter coming with a longer intake manifold to make it more powerful. The longitudinally-mounted engine was mated with a 6-speed manual transmission through which the power was sent to the real wheels. Steel brakes were standard, however, carbon-ceramic brakes were optionally offered with 6-piston Brembo brake callipers up front and 4-piston out back. One of the few rivals on the market could have been the Ferrari Enzo, with a 6.0-liter V12 engine that developed 660 hp and 485 pound-feet of torque.",PAGANI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Pagani Zonda F"",  ""year"": ""2005"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""powerful"", ""exclusive"", ""refreshed"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""carbon-fibre"", ""refreshed""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""single-piece""],    ""exhaust"": [""powerful""]  }}```"
PANOZ Avezzano,"One of the last remaining old-school front-engine, rear-wheel-drive sports cars powered by a V8 engine and featuring a manual transmission, the Panoz Avezzano replaced the Esperante nameplate without completely changing the model's original recipe. Panoz is mostly known as an American carmaker that builds road models mostly to fund its racing endeavors,  much like Ferrari was in its early days. That said, the Avezzano is in many way the street-legal version of a racing car, with its GT4 version competing in the Pirelli World Challenge championship. The sport car's name has a special meaning, since it harks back to the Italian town of Avezzano, which was destroyed by an earthquake in 1915, spurring the emigration of Donald Panoz's grandfather to the United States. Its body is largely made from aerospace-grade SPF aluminum and carbon fiber, with the model preserving the racing car's side exhaust exits, a motorsport inspired front splitter, side skirts and rear diffuser. The chassis itself is made from extruded aluminum but also features tubular steel frames and various carbon fiber parts. Just like its predecessor, the Avezzano is powered in standard guise by a 6.2-liter Chevy-based V8, offering at least 430 horsepower. As an option, customers can switch to a supercharged version of the same engine, which delivers over 580 horsepower. Both engines sent their power to the rear wheels through a manual six-speed transmission.",PANOZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Panoz Avezzano"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""old-school"", ""sporty"", ""aerodynamic"", ""racing-inspired"", ""powerful""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""aerospace-grade"", ""carbon fiber""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""motorsport-inspired"", ""rear""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""side""]  }}```"
PANOZ Roadster,"Since this kind of car didn't exist, somebody had to invent it. And this person is Dan Panoz. An engineering genius who previously worked for Lister, Maserati and Lotus. He decided that the United States deserves a car with the same racing pedigree as the Europeans. In 1989 Dan Panoz came up with a plan, installed the famous 5.0-V8 engine from the Ford Mustang and there you go! A race-car with number plates. The hardest job was to adapt the car for the American roads and be able to register it. The rest is history, but the history still remains. The Panoz Roadster is still in production after 30 years. The upgrades and novelties brought on it over the years are quite respectable. But it doesn't have Android Auto nor Apple CarPlay. The little nimble Panoz Roadster can go from 0 to 60 MPH (97 KPH) in 4.3 seconds and to 100 MPH (168 KPH) in just 13 seconds. But that was just the beginning. After receiving the homologation from U.S. Authorities, the Panoz Roadster received in 1996 a new engine: the 4.6l V8 from the Ford SVT division. Nowadays they switched on the famous LS3 engine from Chevrolet, which offered the same 430 HP from a naturally-aspirated 6,2 liter-engine. Combined with the light weight of the vehicle of only 2570 lb (1170 kg) the performances were great. New wheels and small adjustments were added to the vehicle, thus made it more planted on the ground, with better roadholding capabilities.",PANOZ,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Panoz Roadster"",  ""year"": ""1989"",  ""size"": ""nimble"",  ""overall-design"": [""race-car with number plates"", ""respectable upgrades"", ""light weight""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""small"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""new"", ""planted""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""improved""]  }}```"
PERODUA Axia,"Perodua introduced the Axia on the Malaysian market in 2014 and facelifted the model twice, in 2017 and 2019, to keep the car fresh on the market. The 2019 Axia came with more improvements in 2019 and added functional and aesthetic features to make it more appealing to the customers. It was also one of the most affordable cars on the market. Perodua didn't design the car by itself. It was, in fact, a rebadged Daihatsu Ayla with some restyled elements. At the front, the carmaker installed a grille above the bumper and a trapezoidal-shaped one in the apron. On the sides, a pair of scoops hosted the fog lights. The angled and angular shaped headlights featured signature C-shaped daytime running lights. On the sides, the full-option version came with power retractable and adjustable mirrors. An aerodynamic kit with body-colored side sills made the car looks sportier. Perodua installed an ADAS (Advanced Driving Assistant System) with autonomous braking and pedestrian protection on the Axia. It was the cheapest car on the market to feature that safety equipment. Inside, the dashboard was short and featured a three-curves-shaped instrument cluster where the speedometer took center-stage flanked on the sides by the tachometer on the left and an LCD on the right. It offered room enough for four adult-sized passengers and a trunk that could carry 260 liters (9.2 cu-ft) of luggage. Under the hood, Perodua installed a 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine that provided just 68 hp.

PERODUA Bezza,"The Malaysian brand Perodua introduced the Bezza in 2016 as the company's first sedan, and it added a refreshed version just three years later, in 2019. Perodua built the Bezza, in a specific trim level, as the safest car built by the Malaysian carmaker and obtained a five-star rating at the ASEAN (Asian NCAP) crash-test. While Perodua shared its underpinnings with Daihatsu and the engines were Toyota licensed, the rest of the vehicle was developed in-house by the Malaysian top-selling brand. The 2019 version came with plenty of modifications to the bodywork. At the front, the carmaker installed LED headlights and a new front fascia. Its grille and front bumper went through a cosmetic change that brought a more aggressive styling. On the sides, the power-retractable door-mirrors with incorporated turn-signals became available as an option. Inside the cabin, the Bezza featured a modern-looking dashboard design, with a silver trim that crossed it from door to door and a raised rim above the center stack. Its new infotainment system included a navigation system paired to Android phones only. A new addition was the front bucket-seats that offered an option for leather upholstery. Under the hood, Perodua installed the 1.0-liter and 1.3-liter gasoline engines.

PERODUA Alza,"In September 2018, Perodua introduced the second facelift for the Alza, the first one being launched in 2014, and brought more features for the entire range. Perodua tried to keep its promise to provide the most affordable seven-seat minivan on the Malaysian market. Its Alza MPV was chased by the other local competitor, Proton Exora. When the Alza's second facelift arrived, it was available in three trim levels, and the Standard version sported the 2014 model-year bumpers but still kept a few other amenities from the 2019 model. On the exterior, the 2018 Alza featured a new aerodynamic package and new headlights, but only for the SE and Advance trim levels. The Standard model kept the older ones which were similarly shaped but with a different interior lamp design. The new bumper received a slightly more aggressive styling on the side scoop area, while the grille sported two chromed horizontal slats. All versions received standard fog lights. In the back, the taillights got clear lenses instead of the red ones from the 2014 model (only for SE and Advance). Perodua introduced more interior changes, especially for the Advance trim level, which received leather seats with a nice carbon-fiber look detail for a center strip. On the center stack, the carmaker installed a new infotainment unit for the entire range. The Advance version featured an additional screen mounted on the ceiling for the rear passengers/children for the full-options version.

PERODUA Aruz,"Perodua introduced its third SUV on the market, the Aruz, in 2019, and it was more of a restyled version of the Daihatsu Terios/Rush. The Malaysian carmaker didn't have the necessary experience in developing a seven-seat SUV from the ground up and asked its long-time partner Toyota to give it a hand. That came with the cost of sharing Perodua's production facility from Rawang, Selangor, and the delay in launching the vehicle. While the Japanese-branded vehicle was introduced in 2017, the Perodua-badged car was launched in 2019. Its exterior shared the metallic body panels with the Daihatsu/Toyota Rush, but the bumpers, grille, and side sills sported Perodua's design. The side scoops that hosted the fog lights featured a vertical triangular shape at the front like they were pinched toward the front bumper's center. On the sides, apart from the sculptured doors and rear quarter panels, the carmaker installed black plastic side sills at the bottom. In the back, the angular-shaped taillights crossed the quarter panels onto the liftgate. Inside, the Aruz was exclusively available with seven seats, with the middle row tilting and tumbled forward to make room for accessing the last row. At the front, the instrument cluster showed a clear Toyota styling, with the speedometer and tachometer encircled by light-gray rings and a center-mounted LCD. Perodua offered the Aruz in two trim levels, but with only one engine and transmission option. The carmaker installed a 1.5-liter gasoline engine under the hood and paired it to an electronically controlled four-speed automatic gearbox that sent the power to the rear wheels.",PERODUA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Aruz"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""seven-seat SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""restyled"", ""metallic body panels"", ""sculptured doors"", ""angular-shaped taillights"", ""clear Toyota styling""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""sporty""],    ""hood"": [""metallic""],    ""headlights"": [""angular""],    ""bumper"": [""unique""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PERODUA Myvi,"The Myvi proved to be the Malaysia’s best selling car starting with 1995. 2015 brought an upgraded version of the Myvi, to bring it more up to date and satisfy the needs of the customers. The engine and the transmission options remained the same as before: 1.3-liter, 1.4-liter and the top of the range, the 1.5-liter. We could say that the upgraded version was actually represented by several new versions, as the exterior design of the new Myvi was very different depending on the engine. The 1.5-liter engine came together with a sportier, more aggressive face and other several design details at the back. White the 5-speed manual transmission was the same as before, the 4-speed automatic gearbox was revised to improve the fuel efficiency. The sportier version came with a different grille and headlamps, having a unique front. Also included were LED guide lights - not to be confused with daytime running lights. The alloys on the 1.5-liter, while still the same 14-inch, featured a different spiral design. Specific for the top of the range was also the chrome exhaust pipe. For 2015, the Myvi came with new front parking sensors, with the exception of the base model. The top of the range also featured a new bumper with a diffused, and a bigger rear wing. While the load area size was an acceptable size of 208 L, loading the items was made easier with the lower and wider trunk.",PERODUA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Myvi"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""aggressive"", ""modern"", ""upgraded"", ""differentiated""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""different"", ""sportier"", ""unique""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""guide lights""],    ""bumper"": [""new"", ""diffused"", ""bigger""],    ""wheel"": [""14-inch"", ""spiral design""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""bigger""],    ""spoiler"": [""bigger""],    ""exhaust"": [""chrome""]  }}```"
PEUGEOT 2008,"In 2023 Peugeot refreshed the second generation of the 2008 lineup and gave it a more aggressive look, a richer interior, and improved engines. Many things have changed since 2019, when the second generation of the 2008 broke covers. A world pandemic, an endless microchip crisis, and other unfortunate events shook the automotive market. But, just like during the world financial crisis, carmakers had to do their thing and move on. Peugeot did the same, and despite all odds, it launched the refreshed 2008 lineup in the spring of 2023. The car's front fascia was adorned with the specific claw design on the bumper, albeit this time, it featured three LED-lit lines instead of one, as on the non-facelifted model. In addition, the grille sported the new badge of the automaker, which was a lion's head. On its profile, the car remained the same, but at the back, there was a new signature lighting, with six horizontal blocks of LEDs instead of three vertical lines as on the 2019 model. Inside, the standard touchscreen for the infotainment system grew by three inches from seven to ten. This complemented the information received by the driver via Peugeot's i-Cockpit digital instrument cluster. The steering wheel also sported the new badge. Like on its predecessor, customers were greeted by a pair of bolstered front seats up front and a bench seat in the rear for three passengers. The most significant change for the drivetrain was the electric version, which promised up to 406 km (252 miles) of range from its 156 PS (154 hp) electric motor. Still, for those who needed ICE versions, the automaker offered a range of gasoline and diesel versions.",PEUGEOT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Peugeot 2008"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""rich"", ""refreshed"", ""modern"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""new badge"", ""lion's head""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED-lit"", ""signature lighting""],    ""bumper"": [""claw design"", ""three LED-lit lines""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PEUGEOT 208 5 doors,"Peugeot refreshed the entire lineup of the second generation of the 208 in July 2023, and the electric version was also heavily upgraded. It gained not only a new look but also a more powerful motor and a longer range. Four decades after Peugeot launched the iconic 205 hatchback that sold in over 5 million units, the French automaker tried its best with the B-segment 208. Since the times were changed, the new model also came with an electric version. The automaker was not new to this game since it already tried it on the 106 Electrique supermini hatchback in 1995. Still, that model was a flop, with sales way under the target. But the carmaker learned its lesson, and when it brought the e-208 in 2019, it enjoyed great success. The second generation of the 208 was a tremendous success for the French automaker. Even though it came in 2019, one year before the world pandemic situation, it was on top of its game and recovered quickly. It became the best-selling vehicle in its class for two years in a row, and the electron-powered version came on top of the B-segment in the electric category. Part of that success was the car's exterior design. As a result, Peugeot dared even more when it launched the 2023 model. At the front, instead of one vertical LED strip on each side of the front fascia, included three lines resembling three lion claws. After all, the lion was the brand's badge. Also, the grille was broader and extended on the lower bumper to the apron. The LED headlights lost their vertical illuminated slats and got three LEDs to illuminate the road. Depending on the trim level and color, the e-208 boasted wider tires and flared wheel arches. At the same time, at the back, a roof spoiler adorned the top of the tailgate. Furthermore, the taillights featured three horizontal LED lines instead of vertical ones, as in the 2019 model. As a distinct element for the electric version, Peugeot offered the e-208 with a choice of 16” and 17” light alloy wheels. Peugeot engineers also improved the cabin. Like its predecessor, it featured a digital instrument cluster fronting the driver. In addition, a 10” touchscreen sat on top of the center stack for the infotainment system. Customers could buy the car with up to three charging ports (two at the front and one for the rear passengers) and a wireless charger for their mobile phones. But the most significant upgrade was under the skin. While the automaker kept the same e-CMP platform with a front-wheel-drive setup, the motor was upgraded. Thus, instead of the older 134 HP (136 PS) unit, the automaker installed a 154 (156 PS) electric heart. The battery pack remained at the same value as its predecessor, but the range was extended to 400 km (249 miles) thanks to the new regenerative braking system. The automaker said that the battery pack could have been charged in approximately 25 minutes from 20% to 80% on a fast-charging station, while at a regular 7.5 kW, it took four hours and 40 minutes for the same refill.",PEUGEOT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Peugeot 208"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""B-segment"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""stylish"", ""electric""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broader"", ""extended"", ""stylish""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""three lines"", ""illuminated""],    ""bumper"": [""lower"", ""apron""],    ""wheel"": [""wider"", ""flared"", ""light alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""spoiler"", ""adorned""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PEUGEOT 508 SW,"At the beginning of 2023, Peugeot refreshed its flagship model lineup, the 508, for both versions of it, the sedan and the station wagon, also known as the 508 SW. Peugeot was one of the founders of the Stellantis family thanks to its big sales, and the 508 was one of its most important products. That lineup was introduced in 2018, and five years later, in 2023, it received a well-deserved update. But, apart from the exterior improvements, the car also benefited from some additional upgrades on its interior as well. The car's front was heavily reworked and included a new design for the grille with a 3D pattern flanked by the two fang-like LED daytime running lights. In addition, the car sported new, slimmer headlights that were available with Matrix-LED technology. From its profile, the shooting-brake silhouette was enhanced by the raked-forward tailgate and a discrete roof spoiler above the rear windscreen. Last but not least, Peugeot redesigned the taillights, which sported a three-fang signature light pattern. More upgrades were seen on the inside, where a 10"" touchscreen for the infotainment system replaced the older 8"" unit. Even though the car was a family hauler, it was available with high-bolstered bucket seats at the front, depending on the options. At the back, the same split-folding bench was installed. Under the hood, Peugeot launched the vehicle with a choice of turbo-diesel, gasoline, and hybrid powerplants paired with either six-speed manuals or automatics, depending on the options.",PEUGEOT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Peugeot 508"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""enhanced"", ""slimmer"", ""discrete"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked-forward""],    ""grille"": [""3D pattern"", ""new design""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""slimmer"", ""Matrix-LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""shooting-brake silhouette"", ""discrete spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PEUGEOT 508,"Peugeot refreshed the second generation of its flagship model, the 508, after five years on the market to boost the car's sales. The French automaker was part of the Stellantis family. It introduced the second generation of the 508 in February 2018. Come 2023, the automaker brought the facelifted version of this lineup. The car was not just another mid-size sedan on the European market; it was a statement that Peugeot targeted higher-profile clients. At the front, the automaker installed a redesigned front grille with a 3D pattern flanked by two LED vertical lines for DRLs. The 508's slim headlights were available with Matrix-LED technology. The car's four-door coupe shape remained unchanged. Finally, at the back, the rear fascia was updated with redesigned taillights that sported three ""fangs"" on them. Inside, the automaker installed a wide 10"" touchscreen for the infotainment system. The front high-bolstered bucket seats provided adequate side support for their occupants, while at the back, the bench was most suitable for two occupants. Thanks to the car's long wheelbase, there was enough legroom for those seated in the back, and the center tunnel was short enough to accommodate a third passenger in the middle for short jaunts. Under the hood, Peugeot launched the vehicle with a choice of turbo-diesel, gasoline, and hybrid powerplants. Besides the six-speed manual versions, the automaker also offered an eight-speed automatic transmission.",PEUGEOT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""508"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""mid-size sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""modern"", ""elegant"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""redesigned"", ""3D pattern"", ""flanked by LED lines""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""slim"", ""Matrix-LED technology""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""long wheelbase""],    ""doors"": [""four-door coupe shape""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PEUGEOT 308 5 Doors,"Peugeot introduced the third generation of the 308 hatchback in 2021 with a design that carried over elements from its bigger brothers from the crossover segment. The French carmaker was eager to defeat the Golf at its game and tried to attack the segment differently. It was the first Peugeot to sports the refreshed company logo, which showed a lion head instead of the entire feline. With cues inspired from its award-winning bigger brother 3008, the 308 displayed a front fascia with the vertical LED ""fangs"" on the outer side. It's big mesh-grille looked more aggressive than any of its predecessors, while the LED headlights peeked under the hood line. From its sides, its cab-rearward design inspired a rear-wheel-drive vehicle due to its thick C-pillar and curved roofline. Its sculptured side panels and doors formed a complex aerodynamic flow, reducing the drag-resistance factor. At the back, its taillights formed a long smoked line across the tailgate. Despite the downsize and electrification trends on the market, Peugeot installed fake, chromed exhausts under the apron. The interior looked like its designers didn't communicate with those who shaped the car's exterior. While on the outside, the 308 featured long, curved lines, the minimalist dashboard exposed straight lines, hard edges, and F-117 Stealth style surfaces. The steering wheel was unusually low mounted compared to the instrument cluster. Like its bigger brother 3008, the 308 featured a TFT display for the instrument panel and a secondary touch-screen for the infotainment screen. In the back, Peugeot installed a split-folding bench where three passengers could sit comfortably.

PEUGEOT 308 SW,"Peugeot charged ahead, and three months after it launched the third generation of the 308 hatchback in March 2021, it introduced the SW version as well. First of all, Peugeot said that the SW letters were from Sports Wagon, not from the station wagon. Just by looking at the car's shape, it might be easier to understand why. The French carmaker traded trunk space for looks and created a design that could bring more friends than foes. The design team took its inspiration from the 3008 crossover SUV with a front fascia that featured LED ""fangs."" Its prominent mesh grille looked more aggressive than any of its predecessors, while the LED headlights peeked under the hood line. The SW's profile revealed a cab-rearward design with raked-forward C-pillars and rear windscreen. Its third side window was sloped-down and created the image of a shooting-brake, despite the four doors. The interior looked like its designers didn't communicate with those who shaped the car's exterior. While the 308 featured long, curved lines on the outside, the minimalist dashboard exposed straight lines, hard edges, and F-117 Stealth style surfaces. The steering wheel was unusually low-mounted compared to the instrument cluster. Its instrument cluster featured a TFT display for the instrument panel and a secondary touch-screen for the infotainment screen. Thanks to the increased wheelbase, the 308 SW provided more rear legroom than the hatchback version. Its 40/20/40 split-bench expanded the trunk space from 608 liters (21.5 cu-ft) to 1,634 liters (58 cu-ft).

PEUGEOT 5008,"Like its smaller brother, the 3008, the 5008 was upgraded in 2020 as well, in a moment when Peugeot was the European leader in the compact SUV market. Since 2017, when it was introduced to the market, the 5008 won the hearts (and wallets) of over 300.000 customers. It was an unexpected success for the French vehicle. It was more like a Peugeot 3008 with a longer wheelbase and different back. The front fascia featured the new design language of the standard LED headlights. Like its smaller brother, it featured the same light strips “fangs” on the front bumper. The 3D design of the grille mimicked a mesh and created a sense of space with its chromed pins. The side-scoops placed in front of the wheel-arches were there only for design purposes. The back of the car featured new LED taillights, including the reversing lamps. Inside, the car offered more room in the back than its smaller brother, due to a longer wheelbase. It featured the same evolution for the dashboard, with its enhanced i-Cockpit instrument cluster. It featured a new graphic and new options for the 2020 model year. The infotainment unit featured a 10” high-definition display, placed on top of the center stack. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in some countries, the 5008 was available for completely online purchase and delivery. The 3008 was available with a choice of gasoline, and diesel engines.

PEUGEOT 3008,"Peugeot introduced the E-3008 in 2023 as a full-electric SUV-coupe and built it on Stellantis' new STLA Medium platform, thus creating a fascinating European competitor for Tesla's products thanks to the long-range and European-focused design of the vehicle. The first generation of this nameplate broke covers in 2007, and it wasn't that well-received by customers. Starting with the second generation, which Peugeot introduced in 2016, the car went through a total makeover and revealed itself as an SUV instead of an MPV, as its predecessor. That second generation sold more than 1.3 million units until 2023, when the third sequel of this nameplate was revealed. In addition, since Peugeot was focused on a total electrification of its lineup by 2030, the new model came with a battery-powered model. Unlike the second generation, this one didn't focus mostly on design to attract its customers. Peugeot started a new design language with the 308 in 2021 and improved it in less than two years for other models that it launched. Among them, the 3008 was the boldest one, showing an aggressive look for the front fascia. Three claw-like daytime running lights extended downward on the bumper complemented the slim LED headlights. There was no upper grille. Instead, Peugeot created a panel adorned with a 3D pattern where the brand's logo took center stage. In the air dam, the automaker installed a broad air intake that cooled the car's electric system. It was flanked by functional side scoops that enhanced the vehicle's aerodynamics. From its profile, the 2023 e-3008 showed its coupe-like greenhouse that was ended with a sloped-down rear windscreen. The tall doors and body panels, compared to the height of the windows, enhanced the car's sporty look. Finally, at the back, the automaker added slim taillights connected over the tailgate by a red strip. Thanks to all the hard work of Peugeot's design department, the e-3008 had an excellent drag coefficient of just 0.28. Inside, Peugeot surprised its customers with a 21” curved display called i-Cockpit. In front of the driver, the automaker placed a screen for the instrument panel, followed by the infotainment unit's touchscreen above the center stack. The entire structure featured a floating design trend, emphasized by the ambient lighting underneath it. On the center stack, the automaker placed a third panel with ten touch buttons, accessible by both front seat occupants. A wide and tall center console separated the driver from the side passenger. Since the automaker marketed the vehicle as a sports SUV, it boasted an octagonal-shaped steering wheel with flat top and bottom areas. For the rear passengers, Peugeot installed a split-folding bench with enough headroom for average-sized adults. Despite the sloped roof and the electric platform, the trunk was large, with a total volume of 520 liters (18.4 cu-ft.). But the most essential upgrade of the 3008 was under its skin. Unlike its predecessor, which shared its underpinnings with the compact-sized hatchback 308, the new STLA Medium platform included new front and rear suspension. The automaker offered the e-3008 with a choice of three drivetrains: two with FWD only and one with an all-wheel-drive. Customers had an option for two battery packs with 73 kWh and 98 kWh capacity. In 2WD configuration and the biggest battery, the e-3008 promised a range of up to 700 km (435 miles) on a single charge. Moreover, the 400-volt architecture allowed customers to recharge their vehicles from 160 kW chargers.",PEUGEOT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""E-3008"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""SUV-coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""European-focused"", ""aggressive"", ""sporty"", ""fascinating"", ""bold""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""3D-patterned"", ""logo-centered""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""slim"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""claw-like"", ""functional""],    ""wheel"": [""large"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""doors"": [""tall""],    ""roof"": [""coupe-like"", ""sloped-down""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PEUGEOT 301,"Peugeot introduced the 301 lineup in 2012 as a low-budget vehicle competing with other low-priced cars but built by big automakers’ standards. But after five years on the market, the small-sized sedan went through a facelift that made it look more appealing. During the world financial crisis, one of the best-selling European cars was a budget-friendly car made in Romania, the Dacia Logan. That vehicle saw huge sales compared to other cars, and that gave other automakers the idea of quickly developing a similar product. As a result, Peugeot-Citroen introduced the 301/C-Elisee models in 2012. But by then, the financial crisis had ended. Still, the French automaker had to do something with the newly developed vehicle and introduced it in several markets, not just in Europe. By 2017, though, the car already showed its age, and despite a few mandatory improvements over the years required by changes in legislation, the 301 looked largely the same. So, Peugeot engineers came up with a new model that the carmaker launched in 2017. The new front fascia followed the same design signature as the rest of the Peugeot’s range. It featured swept-back headlights with a dent in their middle that evoked the fangs of a lion. The lower bumper got a new grille at the bottom flanked by side scoops where the automaker installed the fog lamps and the LED daytime running lights. At the same time, the upper grille featured a three-slat design where the Peugeot’s lion badge took center stage. From its profile, there were new improvements on the door panels and the door mirrors. Finally, at the back, the 2017 301 featured a new corner-mounted taillights that boasted a new design adorned with three vertical lights, following the same design concept as the one that existed on other Peugeot models, such as the 2008 and the 3008. Inside, the automaker installed a cabin that didn’t look like it was a budget vehicle. Depending on the options, customers could get the 301 with a touchscreen for the infotainment system and a flat-bottom steering wheel. In addition, the materials’ quality was better than in the non-facelifted version of the vehicle. Still, the automaker couldn’t make more room for the vehicle’s passengers, but it was enough for five occupants on short journeys. Behind the cabin, Peugeot put a luggage compartment that could hold up to 640 liters (22.6 cu-ft.) and attracted customers from many customers. Under the hood, Peugeot installed a choice of two gasoline and one turbodiesel engine. The new, 1.2-liter unit with three cylinders was good enough for in-city transportation. At the same time, the 1.6-liter turbodiesel boasted an incredible fuel efficiency of up to 69.2 MPG (3.4 l/100 km.) on highways.",PEUGEOT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Peugeot 301"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""small-sized sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""budget-friendly"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""compact"", ""efficient""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""swept-back""],    ""grille"": [""new"", ""bottom-flanked"", ""three-slat""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back"", ""dented"", ""evoking fangs""],    ""bumper"": [""lower grille"", ""side scoops"", ""new design""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""improved panels"", ""door mirrors""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""turbodiesel engine""]  }}```"
PEUGEOT Tepee,"Citroen-Peugeot group chose a different way to produce a small MPV as a passenger and as an LCV. The MPVs were out of trend in Europe, but a few carmakers decided that it would be good to fit that niche market with light commercial vehicles converted into passenger vehicles. Thus, the costs for research and development went down, and the production costs were not high. The French carmaker Citroen/Peugeot thought that offering a family car in an LCV body-shape would do great for those who are using a vehicle in both directions. Both vehicles were built on the Peugeot's P2 platform, used for the 307 compact hatchback. The look might not have been its most decisive advantage, but it was built to form a spacious vehicle. With a raked front fascia, an almost vertical A-pillar, and a high roofline, the Partner Tepee had the shape of a light utility vehicle. The car featured sliding doors, which eased the loading and unloading. A flat and vertical tailgate abruptly ended the car. Inside, there was a cavernous space with a lot of headroom. The flat floor allowed an unobstructed passage from one side to the other via the sliding doors. The high driving position and the dashboard were made to fit a daily job as a delivery van. With the rear seats that could have been reclined, the comfort was good. If there was a need to transport bulky items, the rear seats could have been folded or completely removed. It was also available with a 7-seat option. Under the hood, the most requested engine was a 1.6-liter diesel unit mated to a 6-speed manual. The in-dash, high-mounted gear-stick was easy to use and practical since it eased the move inside the cabin from left to right.",PEUGEOT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Partner Tepee"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""spacious"",  ""overall-design"": [""spacious"", ""utilitarian"", ""practical"", ""functional"", ""versatile""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""flat""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sliding""],    ""roof"": [""high""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PEUGEOT Pick Up,"Peugeot returned on the pickup market with the 2017 Pick Up model, based on the Chinese Dongfeng Rich light-utility vehicle. The French carmaker had a long history of pickup vehicles in Africa, with models that dated back to 1956. Over time, it lost its interest in that segment since the development cost began to rise and the market was not that big. But its Chinese partner Dongfeng had a license for the Nissan Navara N22, which is already built and sold as Rich pickup. At the front, the Pick Up featured a flat front fascia with a three-slat vertical grille that supported the chromed Peugeot's Lion badge. Its bumper featured a lower grille flanked by a pair of scoops that hosted the daytime running lights and the fog lights. It was easy to recognize the shape of the N22 Nissan Navara due to its flared wheel arches from its sides. The tailgate sported the stamped Peugeot brand name, as on its former 404 and 504 models. With its full-size, four-door cabin, the Peugeot Pick Up featured a five-seat interior with two seats at the front and a bench in the back fit for three adults and adequate legroom. At the front, there was a straight dashboard with a raised center stack that hosted the radio on top and the climate controls lower. The carmaker installed larger dials for the speedometer and tachometer on the instrument cluster, flanking an LCD for the onboard computer. Under the hood, Peugeot installed a 2.5-liter turbo-diesel that provided 115 hp. It was paired to a standard five-speed manual gearbox and an option for a 2WD or 4x4 system. The latter featured a transfer case with high and low-range gears.",PEUGEOT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Peugeot Pick Up"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""full-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""flat front fascia"", ""flared wheel arches"", ""four-door cabin""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""vertical"", ""chromed"", ""three-slat""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""daytime running"", ""fog""],    ""bumper"": [""lower grille"", ""scoops""],    ""wheel"": [""flared arches""],    ""doors"": [""four-door""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PEUGEOT 108,"We all know that producing an entirely new car is extremely expensive. That’s why we got 3 almost identical vehicles, the Peugeot 108, the Toyota Aygo and the Citroen C1. The Peugeot 108 was available with a 3 or a 5-door configuration. The top of the range model had a fully retractable fabric roof. There is not much to say about the exterior, as it is simple and good looking for a small car, with its eyebrow led strips. The interior of the 108 looked funky with the gloss black finishes and the fabric upholstery, and that was not necessarily a bad thing. The 108 was equipped with keyless entry as standard on the top spec model. Inside the cabin users could find plenty of storage spaces, as well as a big glovebox that even fit a 2L bottle. The cupholders were conveniently placed and didn’t need much of the driver’s attention to be used. The standard trim came with an optional 5-inch touchscreen display and the more equipped versions had a 7-inch touchscreen display. We could say that the Peugeot 108 was rather spacious for a city designed car and the same applied to the load area where a big luggage would fit. The best part about the mini car was the reduced fuel consumption, for both the 1.0-liter and the 1.2-liter 3-cylinder petrol engines. The easy steering and the car’s reduced dimensions made it a perfect match for city traffic. If thinking to take the 108 on the fast country roads, I would say not a good choice. It takes a long time to get to 100 km/h and the engine is rather noisy at those speeds. Overall, the 108 looked cool and users could choose between 8 different colors , as well as two-tones schemes. A car that was cheap to buy, was easy to maintain and had a reduced fuel consumption, pretty much a safe choice, right?",PEUGEOT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Peugeot 108"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""simple"", ""good-looking"", ""spacious"", ""reduced fuel consumption"", ""city-friendly""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""eyebrow LED strips""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""3 or 5-door configuration""],    ""roof"": [""fully retractable fabric roof""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PEUGEOT Landtrek,"Peugeot opened in 2020 a new chapter in its history, by launching Landrek, a new pick-up with off-road capabilities. The French manufacturer is one of the leading European LCV car-makers but they are lacking a pickup. Their co-operation with the Chinese brand Changan led to a duo of vehicles based on a chassis and capable of carrying a 1 metric ton load. The new Peugeot Landtrek comes in two body shapes, with two or four doors, with a bed or as chassis-cab. Also, it comes with two or four-wheel-drive, with manual transmission and two-speed transfer case. There are two engines available, both turbocharged. A 2.4-liter gasoline unit with 210 hp and a workhorse of 1.9-liter diesel with 150 hp. Both can be equipped with a 6-speed manual transmission but only the gasoline-powered version can be ordered with a 6-speed automatic transmission with sequential shifting and two operation modes (Sport and Eco). Inside the cabin, depending on the trim levels, Landtrek can be equipped more for a working environment or for a leisure one. Touch-screen display in the middle of the dashboard and even a TFT screen in the instrument cluster. For the off-road trips, the Landtrek can tackle wading of 600 mm (2 ft) and it has a ground clearance of up to 235 mm (9.25 in) with 17” wheels. The approach and departure angle are 30, respectively 27 degrees, and a central angle of 25 degrees. The car is expected to be present in Latin America and Saharian Africa.",PEUGEOT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Landtrek"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""mid-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""functional"", ""versatile""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""angled""],    ""grille"": [""bold""],    ""hood"": [""bulky""],    ""headlights"": [""sleek""],    ""bumper"": [""robust""],    ""wheel"": [""17-inch""],    ""doors"": [""two or four""],    ""roof"": [""utilitarian""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PEUGEOT RIFTER,"The French carmaker had a different idea about how an MPV should look, so it made the Partner Tepee which it replaced in 2018 with the Rifter. Europeans tried to build minivans, but the result was not that good. So, Peugeot thought about a middle ground. Instead of developing one from scratch, it made an LCV based on a passenger car platform and, afterward, turned it into an MPV. Since the LCV market was very important in the French carmaker economy, it focused on developing a bodywork suitable for one. Thus, it made a short front end with a flat front fascia and high-mounted headlights. For the passenger version, it added as an option a plastic underbody shield that looked like an aluminum one and a pair of foglights deep inside unpainted, black clusters. Thus, the main grille was small, but the cooling area was complemented by an additional, lower grille. From its profile, the Rifter looked more like an LCV with its flat side panels and rear sliding doors. Moreover, the black door mirrors were huge compared to those installed on hatchbacks or mid-size sedans. Inside, not even NBA players could complain about headroom. Above the windshield line, the carmaker had enough room to install a shelf for small items, an emergency kit, and the owner's manual. At the back, the ingress and egress were very easy, and passengers could've enjoyed the three-seat layout, which, when folded down or completely removed, transformed the family vehicle into a proper LCV. Last but not least, the car was available in a longer version that provided room for seven occupants. Since the car was based on the same EMP2 platform shared with a compact hatchback and a compact crossover, it featured just small, inline-four engines paired to a standard six-speed manual gearbox. For specific versions, the carmaker added an eight-speed automatic transmission.",PEUGEOT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Rifter"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""practical"", ""versatile"", ""functional"", ""spacious"", ""utilitarian""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""tall"", ""spacious""],    ""grille"": [""small"", ""low-mounted""],    ""hood"": [""short"", ""flat""],    ""headlights"": [""high-mounted"", ""unpainted"", ""black clusters""],    ""bumper"": [""functional"", ""complementary""],    ""wheel"": [""black"", ""huge""],    ""doors"": [""sliding"", ""rear""],    ""roof"": [""roomy"", ""shelf-equipped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""standard"", ""functional""]  }}```"
PEUGEOT 408 Fastback,"Designed as a contender in the compact SUV-coupe segment, the 408 was the badged-engineered version of the 2021 Citroen C4 SUV. While upmarket customers aimed for the likes of the BMW X4 or the Mercedes-Benz's GLC, the French carmaker Peugeot imagined an alternative for those, with a less-expensive version of an SUV coupe named 408. Even though it couldn't provide the same features as its German competitors, it offered a lower price and, most importantly, a complete safety package. Last but not least, it promised to provide better fuel efficiency. With its swept-back roofline and athletic appearance, the 408 impressed with a dynamic look that couldn't get unnoticed by European customers. At the front, the fang-like LED daytime running lights were placed on the outer side of the front fascia, while the narrow LED headlights created an aggressive look for the car. Moreover, the grille sported a new design language for the carmaker, with a V-shaped mesh pattern. Inside, the 408 boasted a two-display dashboard: one in the instrument cluster and one atop the center stack for the infotainment system. The front bucket seats were separated by a tall center console, separating the front seats into two individual cocoons. At the back, the split-folding bench was roomy enough for two adult-sized passengers or three children. Despite the sloping back, the trunk was big enough for a family of four. Under the hood, Peugeot installed either mild-hybrid or plug-in hybrid versions that sent the power to the front wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission.",PEUGEOT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Peugeot 408"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact SUV-coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""swept-back roofline"", ""athletic appearance"", ""dynamic look"", ""aggressive look"", ""roomy trunk""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""V-shaped mesh pattern""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""narrow LED headlights""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""front bucket seats"", ""tall center console""],    ""roof"": [""sloping back""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""mild-hybrid or plug-in hybrid versions""]  }}```"
PEUGEOT Traveller,"Peugeot introduced the Traveller in 2016 as its largest MPV for private and fleet customers, a nine-seat vehicle that helped large families to travel together. European automakers didn’t have too much experience in building minivans, and the market segment was not big enough to help them make a good profit if they didn’t play it smart. So, the Peugeot-Citroen group (PSA) allied with Toyota and made one. In addition, since Opel was already part of the PSA, it made its own version. But each automaker tried to adapt its version so it could fit in the brand’s design language, so the French automaker Peugeot did the same and gave the car a distinct look. It wasn’t exactly a looker, but thanks to its approach and pricing policy, it sold well on the European market. Usually, minivans can’t tell a design story, and those made in cooperation with several brands are even less distinct. And yet, Peugeot’s design team managed to accomplish that when it penned the Traveller. At the front, the tall bumper featured a “fang” that masked a small portion of the headlights. Thus, it resembled the same design language seen on other Peugeot models, such as the 2008 and 3008. Unlike those models, the Traveller wasn’t fitted with LED bulbs, so customers had to deal with the regular halogen or Xenon headlamps. Furthermore, the black grille with chromed a surrounding resembled other vehicles made by the same brand, while the lower part of the bumper carried over design elements from the 308 and 208, especially the boomerang-shaped LED daytime running lights. From its profile, depending on the trim level and options, Peugeot offered either steel wheels or light-alloy ones. The automaker made the car with standard front doors and a sliding one on the curbside, while the one from the driver’s side was on the options list. At the back, the Traveller featured a large tailgate. Inside, the automaker tried its best to provide what customers needed, from a low-grade, fabric-covered seat to a luxurious, leather-wrapped interior. Moreover, a panoramic glass roof added more light to the interior over the second and third rows of seats. For the driver and side passenger, the automaker installed tall individual seats. In front of the steering wheel, the automaker placed an instrument cluster filled with a few dials and a small TFT that showed data from the car’s onboard computer. For more convenience and pleasure driving, Peugeot added a touchscreen atop the center stack, which supported Bluetooth connectivity. Since the MPV was available in a choice of three lengths. The shortest was mostly for business or family use, while the longest was more suitable as a shuttle vehicle. Under the hood, PSA installed a choice of four engines ranging between 94 HP (95 PS) and 174 HP (180 PS). The lowest-powered version was paired with a five-speed manual, while the upper ones were available with either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic. All of them sent their power to the front wheels only.",PEUGEOT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Traveller"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""large MPV"",  ""overall-design"": [""distinct look"", ""tall bumper"", ""black grille"", ""boomerang-shaped LED daytime running lights"", ""panoramic glass roof""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black"", ""chromed surrounding""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""halogen"", ""Xenon""],    ""bumper"": [""tall"", ""boomerang-shaped""],    ""wheel"": [""steel"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [""sliding on curbside""],    ""roof"": [""panoramic glass""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
Pininfarina B95,"Automobili Pininfarina unveiled a stunning-looking open-top EV at the 2023 Monterey Car Week, offering customers a limited-edition vehicle suitable for the track but friendly with the environment. The car manufacturer named its creation B95. B stood for the Barchetta styling, and 95 to celebrate the establishment of the Pininfarina S.p.A company back in 1930 by no other than the famous designer Battista ""Pinin"" Farina. When the brand traded hands in 2015 and was transformed into Automobili Pininfarina by its new owner, the Indian Mahindra Group, its purpose was slightly changed. From creating designs for other automakers, such as Ferrari, it became a stand-alone car manufacturer. That's how the fabulous Pininfarina Battista electric hypercar was born. Based on that model, the Italian marque developed the new B95. At the front, the roadster featured a black line wrapped around the entire front fascia and incorporated LED headlights. Underneath it, the automaker installed a wide air intake that cooled some of the car's radiators. In addition, on the lower side, Pininfarina installed a carbon-fiber splitter with the brand's name embedded into the paint's lacquer. On the front area, the car manufacturer placed extracting vents on the area where other cars had hoods. These vents resembled those from the famous Ferrari Testarossa. From its profile, the lack of a proper windshield emphasized the car's low stance. The car manufacturer installed two small-sized windscreens that the driver and side passenger could raise according to their needs and sizes. Behind the cockpit, the B95 featured two tall bulges that concealed the safety arches and two storage areas large enough to fit helmets inside them. The rear fascia showed a similar wrap-around black strip that housed the slim LED taillights. Lower, under the bumper, the B95 featured a diffuser that enhanced downforce. Pininfarina didn't make the EV hypercar just to look good. Everything on the vehicle served a purpose. Customers could easily open the doors upwards by pushing the buttons hidden inside the side scoops to step inside the cockpit. The carbon fiber doors were garnished on the interior side by carefully crafted and finished door cards. Pininfarina installed a pair of sports seats in the cabin fitted with four-point harnesses, specially designed for a track but still legal for use on streets. Under the carbon fiber skin, the B95 concealed the same drivetrain as the Pininfarina Battista hypercar. This was developed by no other than Rimac for the Nevera. Thus, the look of this Barchetta was matched by the most powerful electric hypercar setup to that date. There were four motors for each corner of the vehicle that provided a total output of 1400 kW (1877 HP) and a heavy truck-like torque of 2300 Nm (1696 lb-ft). It could reach 60 mph from a standstill in less than two seconds onto its way to a top speed of 300 kph (186 mph). The car manufacturer built just 10 units of this marvelous Barchetta EV.",Pininfarina,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""B95"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""small-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""stunning"", ""open-top"", ""limited-edition"", ""track-friendly"", ""environmentally friendly""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""lack of proper windshield"", ""low stance""],    ""grille"": [""wide air intake"", ""carbon-fiber splitter""],    ""hood"": [""extracting vents""],    ""headlights"": [""LED headlights""],    ""bumper"": [""diffuser""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""carbon fiber doors"", ""upward-opening doors"", ""hidden buttons""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""enhanced downforce""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
Pininfarina Battista,"The famous Italian design studio penned vehicles for prestigious brands such as Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, and even Cadillac, but the Battista was the first car that wore the Pininfarina badge as a brand. Based on the same underpinnings as the Croatian hypercar Rimac Nevera, the Battista was an exclusive, 150-unit vehicle built for those who wanted more luxury and a prestigious badge on their cars. Sure, the Nevera was stunning, but Rimac didn't have the same appeal to the rich and famous as the Italian brand. And why Battista? Well, that was the name of the company's founder, Battista Farina, who created Carozzeria Pinin Farina in 1930. The Battista featured a hypercar shape with a short front overhang and a curved, long greenhouse with a sloped-down rear window. At the back of the car, a massive adjustable wing added aerodynamic load for high-speed cornering abilities. As expected, there were no exhausts present, and neatly concealed between the taillights, the carmaker installed the plug-in charging port. Inside, the Battista was designed as a GT, with expensive materials and high-quality finishes. To further emphasize the difference between the occupants, the driver could've opted for a seat finished in a different color than the passenger's one. The car benefited from Rimac's expertise and featured four electric motors, one for each wheel, that offered a total of 1,900 hp, enough to propel the two-ton vehicle from naught to sixty in less than two seconds.",Pininfarina,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Battista"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""hypercar"",  ""overall-design"": [""exclusive"", ""luxurious"", ""prestigious"", ""aerodynamic"", ""high-performance""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""curved"", ""long""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""short""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""adjustable""],    ""exhaust"": [""absent"", ""concealed""],  }}```"
Polestar 2,"Polestar upgraded its five-door EV a boost in 2023 for the 2024 model year, and besides the updated exterior, it also offered new options for the drivetrain. The Swedish brand has been focused on performance electric vehicles and was as relentless. After successfully introducing the 2 on the market in 2017, it continued improving the car. But instead of adding small upgrades year by year, it gathered them and put them all together in the facelifted 2024 model year. With its minimalist design language, Polestar 2 was a distinct appearance on the market. Not only that, it came with a prestigious heritage but also with a promise of safety. In addition, the 2024 model year came with a flat panel between the headlights instead of an egg-crate grille like its predecessor. In addition, the vehicle sported new 20” light-alloy wheels. Inside, the automaker installed standard wireless charging on the entire range and improved the safety systems. In addition, it came with Cross Traffic Alert, Rear Collision Warning and Mitigation, and a 360-degree camera. But the most significant upgrades were on the drivetrain, where the automaker installed a 69 kWh battery pack for the base version with an option for an 82 kWh. Single motor versions featured a rear-wheel drive system instead of FWD as on its predecessor. At the same time, the twin-motor vehicles have received a 10 kWh (14 hp) boost over the 2017 model year. Top of the range version featured a Performance Pack option that provided 350 kW (476 hp) sent in all corners.",Polestar,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Polestar 2"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""minimalist"", ""distinct"", ""prestigious"", ""safe"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""flat""],    ""grille"": [""none""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""between"", ""new""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""20-inch"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
Polestar 1,"Volvo made a bold move with the high-performance brand Polestar, and the first model was named 1 and was a personal luxury coupe with plug-in hybrid technology. The Swedish carmaker made a coupe with a luxury GT price and an environmentally-friendly powertrain. Instead of going for a big, V-8 or V-12 engine, Volvo granted the Polestar 1 with an inline-four that powered the front wheels and two electric motors for the rear wheels. From its profile, the Polestar 1 resembled the Volvo P1800 Coupe. Its long hood and raked windshield formed an aerodynamic shape, while at the back, the flat and short trunk lid left no mistake that it was a three-box sedan vehicle, not a fastback/hatchback coupe. The front fascia featured the Volvo-style headlights with the Thor-hammer design for the daytime running lights and a grille with vertical slats and no Volvo diagonal line. Its taillights showed a C-shaped line like the trunk was placed between brackets. For the cabin, the carmaker installed a leather-clad interior with carbon-fiber trims. Its instrument cluster was digital, and the infotainment system was typical Volvo. At the front, it featured two high-bolstered seats that promised good side support, but in the back, there was minimal headroom for anyone taller than five-foot (1.52 m). Kids in child-seats fixed in the Isofix system were OK, though. But with a 143 liters (5 cu-ft) trunk, the backseats were better used as an additional storage area for decent luggage. The powertrain was the most intriguing part of the vehicle. While the carmaker said it could do a 0-60 (0-97 kph) run in less than 4.5 seconds, the maximum speed was limited to 180 kph (112 mph). On the plus side, it could run for up to 150 km (93 miles) on batteries only.",Polestar,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Polestar 1"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""personal luxury coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""bold"", ""aerodynamic"", ""luxury"", ""environmentally-friendly"", ""intriguing""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""grille"": [""vertical slats""],    ""hood"": [""long""],    ""headlights"": [""Volvo-style"", ""Thor-hammer design""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
Polestar 3,"Polestar was created as a sporty and luxurious brand for Volvo, which, in turn, was part of the Chinese group Geely. With a design inspired by the Scandinavian minimalism and the safety of a Volvo, Polestar's third model brought on the market impressed with its simple yet attractive design. In addition, the electric drivetrain and respectable range endangered many other vehicles from the segment. In addition, the automaker focused more on safety. After all, Polestar was part of Volvo cars. In terms of design, the 3 featured a front fascia fitted with LED daytime running lights resembling the Thor hammer, like those installed on many Volvo cars. Polestar installed a heated slat on the narrow grille that hosted a camera and several sensors for various safety systems such as automatic emergency braking or adaptive cruise control. Above it, Polestar installed a small wing that helped the car obtain a very low drag coefficient. From its profile, the five-door SUV featured an unusual ascending beltline that ended behind the rear doors with a steep angle. Finally, at the back, the vehicle featured a curved tailgate with a roof spoiler on top. Inside, the automaker installed a minimalist interior with a landscape-oriented instrument panel fronting the driver and a portrait-mode 14.5"" touchscreen on the center stack. The bucket seats were wrapped in man-made leather. In addition, Polestar installed radar sensors that could detect small movements, such as the breath of a living being. These sensors were connected to the HVAC unit so it could provide heating and ventilation inside the cabin. Apart from the front seats, the automaker installed a split-folding rear bench. The drivetrain was made with a dual-motor setup that provided 489 ps and an 840 Nm (620 lb-ft) sent to all wheels.",Polestar,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Polestar"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""five-door SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""luxurious"", ""minimalist"", ""attractive"", ""simple""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""narrow"", ""fitted with LED daytime running lights"", ""heated slat""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""resembling Thor hammer""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""five-door"", ""split-folding rear""],    ""roof"": [""curved"", ""with a spoiler on top""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
Polestar 4,"Polestar revealed a new model at the 2023 Shanghai Auto Show, and it stunned the audience with the sleek, coupe-like shape of its new crossover. The high-performance division of Volvo, now under the Chinese brand Geely, continued its quest to develop new exciting models for those willing to travel CO2-free. Moreover, the automaker targeted a range of up to 350 miles (563 km) on a single charge for the dual-motor version. But that wasn't all; for the Long Range version, which was fitted with one motor, Polestar announced a comfortable range of 372 miles (599 km). Both figures were related to the WLTP cycle. But those figures didn't mean anything unless the end product wouldn't perform and look good. But the carmaker nailed those aspects as well. By using sharp lines for the headlights, the SUV-coupe vehicle resembled some of the automaker's concept cars previously shown. Viewed from the sides, the crossover has shown its sloped-down rear end of the greenhouse, and there was no rear windscreen. Instead, Polestar installed a camera at the back that projected the image on a high-definition screen that replaced the rear-view mirror. Inside, the five-seat vehicle offered the same minimalist design as seen in other Polestar products. There were two bolstered seats at the front and a benchseat for three in the back. Thanks to Geely's proprietary Sustainable Experience Architecture (SEA) platform, the automaker could create a completely flat floor. Thus, there were no issues with legroom for three occupants, even on long journeys. At the front, Polestar 4 featured two screens: one fronting the driver and the other one placed atop the center stack. The Polestar 4 was the quickest vehicle produced by the automaker until then. Depending on the version, it was available either as a rear-wheel drive or an all-wheel drive vehicle.",Polestar,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Polestar 4"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""coupe-like"", ""sharp"", ""minimalist"", ""exciting""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""sharp-lined""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PORSCHE Cayenne S,"Porsche refreshed the third generation of its flagship SUV, the Cayenne, in 2013, five years after the model's introduction at the Frankfurt International Motor Show. The German automaker introduced the first generation of the Cayenne in 2002, and it instantly polarized the market. While the brand's hard-core fans were enraged, the company enjoyed huge sales. Soon, it became the best-selling Porsche vehicle. Fast forward more than two decades, and the third's generation facelift appeared on the market. But it wasn't just a slight update, especially for the base version known as the Cayenne S. One of the most significant upgrades seen on the 2023 model was at the front fascia that sported standard Matrix LED headlights, which were previously offered as an option. In addition, the automaker offered an HD Matrix LED version for those. From its profile, the standard wheels grew in size from 19"" to 20 inches. Finally, at the back, the automaker installed redesigned taillights. A distinctive feature of the vehicle compared to higher-powered Cayenne models was noticed under the bumper, where the carmaker installed rectangular chromed tips for the exhaust system. Inside, the most significant upgrade was on the dashboard, which sported a completely digital instrument panel complemented by a touchscreen for the infotainment system atop the center stack. Furthermore, the side passenger could access music and other info on a third screen with touch capabilities mounted in front of them. Like its predecessors, the 2023 Cayenne S featured a luxurious interior with bolstered front seats and a split-folding bench seat in the back. But the most crucial upgrade for the Cayenne S was under the hood. Porsche ditched the formerly used 2.9-liter twin-turbocharged V6 and installed a larger turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 that produced 34 more PS (33.5 hp). At the same time, torque was raised by 50 Nm (37 lb-ft) for a total of 600 Nm (443 lb-ft). Thus, the 0 to 62 mph (0-100 kph) time was reduced by 0.2 seconds.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Cayenne S"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""larger wheels"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""redesigned""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""Matrix LED"", ""standard"", ""HD Matrix LED""],    ""bumper"": [""rectangular chromed exhaust tips""],    ""wheel"": [""larger size""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""larger tips""]  }}```"
PORSCHE Cayenne,"Porsche introduced the third generation of its full-size luxury SUV Cayenne in 2017 and kept it virtually unchanged until 2023 when it added a facelifted version at the Shanghai Auto Show. Usually, German automakers use a four-year gap between the launch of a new model and its facelifted version. But Porsche is not a typical brand, so it could afford to do things differently. So, instead of refreshing the lineup in 2021, it postponed it for almost two years until the Spring of 2023. But the wait was well worth it thanks to the newly added features in the standard package, improved cabin equipment, and better performance. On the outside, the 2023 Cayenne featured a modified front fascia that sported two horizontal slats over the grille and the side scoops. But the most significant change was for the headlights, which featured a standard Matrix LED system previously offered only as an option. Another upgrade was for the wheels, which grew from 19"" to 20"" in diameter. Last but not least, the overall length has been increased. Inside, Porsche completely revamped the cabin, adding a new dashboard and up to three displays: one in front of the driver, a second one for the infotainment system atop the center stack, and the third one on the passenger's side. Moreover, there was no analog tachometer anymore, which might enrage some customers. Another major change was for the gear selector, which was moved from the center console onto the dashboard next to the steering wheel. For the drivetrain, Porsche used the same three-liter turbo V6 but tuned to provide more power and torque. But despite that increase, the fuel efficiency was slightly improved.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Cayenne"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""full-size luxury SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""modified front fascia"", ""larger wheels"", ""increased overall length"", ""revamped cabin"", ""upgraded headlights""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""horizontal slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""Matrix LED system""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""20\"" in diameter""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PORSCHE Cayenne Coupe,"Porsche introduced the Cayenne Coupe in 2019, and it was an instant hit among customers, although sales slowed down during the world pandemic in 2020. Fast forward four years, and the entire Cayenne lineup was refreshed, so the sloped-back version of Porsche's largest 4x4 vehicle was also improved. Thus, it stayed on top of its game in the SUV-coupe segment. But since the automaker also had to provide something more eco-friendly, it offered the SUV with a plug-in hybrid drivetrain that was improved when compared to its predecessors. In addition, the interior was vastly revamped. Right from the bat was easy to recognize the facelifted version of the Cayenne third generation due to the front fascia. Just like the rest of the range, the sloped-back version featured a new front bumper that sported two slats, instead of three on its predecessor, over the grille and the side scoops. In addition, the standard Matrix LED headlights provided not just a better look for the vehicle but also improved road illumination. Inside, customers found a refreshed dashboard design that sported three displays. The one fronting the driver was a configurable 12.6"" curved screen. The other two were touchscreen-type and reserved for the infotainment system: a 12.3"" one atop the center stack and a 10.9"" one on the passenger's side. Another significant change was for the gear selector, which was moved from the center console onto the dashboard next to the steering wheel. The plug-in hybrid Cayenne featured a larger battery pack that allowed it to travel up to 90 km (56 miles) on electricity only. Porsche also installed an onboard charger that allowed the vehicle to be topped up at an 11 kW port in around two and a half hours. Thanks to the 130 kW (174 hp) motor that helped the turbocharged gasoline V6 under the hood, the total output had been increased to 475 PS (469 hp). Like the rest of the Cayenne range, the Hybrid version sent all the oomph in all corners via an eight-speed automatic transmission.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Cayenne Coupe"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""largest 4x4 vehicle"",  ""overall-design"": [""sloped-back"", ""refreshed"", ""facelifted"", ""eco-friendly"", ""vastly revamped""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""new front bumper"", ""two slats"", ""Matrix LED""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""Matrix LED""],    ""bumper"": [""new front bumper""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""plug-in hybrid"", ""larger battery pack"", ""onboard charger"", ""130 kW motor""]  }}```"
PORSCHE 911 Carrera T,"Porsche brought back the T version of the 911 Carrera in 2023, and it fitted it with all the necessary stuff that made this variant of the famous sports car so appealing. The Carrera T stood between the basic 911 Carrera and the 911 Carrera S in terms of performance and price. In 1968 Porsche introduced the T version, which stood for ""Touring,"" and it was a homologation special. That means that it was stripped from all unnecessary amenities for a race car, but enough of them to be appealing for regular use on the road. From the outside, the 911 Carrera T revealed its character through the Dark Grey details applied on the door mirrors' top and bottom. Moreover, there were new door and rear logos. In addition, the windshield featured a grey-tinted upper section. Another specific feature was the five-spoke light-alloy wheels with 20 inches in size for the front axle and 21 inches for the rear. Finally, at the back, the trim strips on the rear grille were finished in Agate Grey, while the tailpipes were high-gloss black. Inside, the most intriguing detail was the manual gearbox. Porsche also offered an automatic gearbox at no extra cost. However, customers for the T-version were more attracted to this old-school transmission type. Moreover, the car offered room for only two occupants on the standard four-way Sports Seats Plus at the front. There was no bench in the back to save weight. In addition, Porsche put less sound-deadening materials and thinner carpets. Under the hood, the carmaker placed the same 3.0-liter turbocharged flat-six as in the back tuned for 385 PS (380 HP) as its Carrera sibling, and it was paired with a standard seven-speed manual or the optional eight-speed PDK (dual-clutch) automatic gearbox. Also, the standard PASM suspension and the Chrono package were offered as standard. In addition, customers could opt for a rear-wheel steering system.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""911 Carrera T"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""20 inches for the front axle and 21 inches for the rear"",  ""overall-design"": [""Dark Grey details"", ""five-spoke light-alloy wheels"", ""Agate Grey trim strips"", ""high-gloss black tailpipes"", ""manual gearbox"", ""two occupants seating"", ""less sound-deadening materials""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""grey-tinted upper section""],    ""grille"": [""trim strips finished in Agate Grey""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""five-spoke light-alloy wheels""],    ""doors"": [""Dark Grey details on door mirrors"", ""new door and rear logos""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""high-gloss black tailpipes""]  }}```"
PORSCHE 911 GT3,"For the German carmaker was another day at the office, but for the enthusiasts, it was another masterpiece for the roads. Porsche didn't forget its roots and kept the 911 range on the market even though the internal-combustion engines were on the brink of extinction. But the carmaker continued on using its flat-six powerplant. It pleased its customers with a road-legal but a track-ready version of the 992 generation of the 911. It was the most hard-core version of its family. With a design inspired by race cars, the GT3 RS featured a wild aerodynamic package that began with exhausts on the front hood and fenders. Its front bumper featured a broader grille at the bottom, allowing more cold air into the center-mounted radiator. On the sides, the crease on the front fenders and doors was inspired by the street version of the Porsche 911 GT1 Le Man car. At the back, the swan-type wing adorned the rear end. At the same time, the lower bumper sported a similar diffuser as the regular 911 GT3, with dual exhausts in the middle. Inside, the standard carbon-fiber bucket seats fitted with race harnesses were standard. Also, the car featured a different steering wheel that allows the driver to make various settings for the car. They could adjust the bound and rebound rates, the eLSD (electronically-control Limited-Slip Differential), and the DRS (drag-reduction system) that lowered the car's aerodynamic drag for higher speeds. The naturally-aspirated flat-six engine in the back provided 525 hp, which was sent to the rear wheels only via a seven-speed automatic (PDK – double-clutch) transmission.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Porsche 911 GT3 RS"",  ""year"": ""992"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""track-ready"", ""aerodynamic"", ""wild"", ""hard-core"", ""race-inspired""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broader"", ""bottom-mounted""],    ""hood"": [""exhausts""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""broader"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""creased""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""similar to regular 911 GT3""],    ""spoiler"": [""swan-type""],    ""exhaust"": [""dual""]  }}```"
PORSCHE Macan S,"Porsche introduced a last facelift for the Macan lineup in 2021 and brought more power under the hood, a refreshed design, and an improved interior. When Porsche introduced the Cayenne in its lineup, its fans were outraged. Soon, the big SUV became the biggest seller from its stable, and it was accompanied by the Panamera and, in 2014, by the smaller SUV Macan. After a few updates in 2015 and 2018, the Macan received a final refresh in 2021, bringing a new front fascia. The Porsche Dynamic Light System became standard for the entire Macan range. In addition, the new LED Porsche repositioned the daytime running lights on the upper side of the side-scoops. The design team also worked on the car's back, creating a rounded shape and installing a striking diffuser. The Macan's interior received a new center console with a shorter gear selector, surrounded by touch buttons instead of physical ones. Thus, the carmaker believes that it enhanced the driver's experience and created a cleaner, sharper look for the car. Porsche fitted a new center console inside the Macan GTS, enhanced with touch controls instead of physic buttons and a shorter gear selector. In addition, the carmaker now installed the analog clock on top of the dashboard as a standard feature. There was also a new range of colors available for the leather-wrapped interior. Under the hood, the Macan S received a 2.9-liter turbocharged gasoline engine paired to a seven-speed automatic gearbox. It sent the power in all corners and provided similar performances as the outgoing GTS model. However, unlike the 2021 GTS, the S didn't feature the same stiffened air suspension.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Macan"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""rounded"", ""striking"", ""cleaner"", ""sharper""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""refreshed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""repositioned"", ""daytime running""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""striking""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PORSCHE 911 Carrera GTS,"For some people, the Porsche GT3 was too much to drive it on the road, but the Porsche Carrera S was too soft. So, in 2014, the German car-makers unveiled the bridge between those two: the Carrera GTS Coupe. Porsche 911 was on the market since the late '60s. It was the car that was on wall posters, computer wallpapers, screensavers, and smartphone backgrounds. It was a car built by enthusiasts for enthusiasts. Its overall shape didn't change that much since the first model appeared on the market. It grew in all sizes and it offered more and more power. When more and more race-tracks were opened for public and weekend races started to happened, more often, drivers started to look for more power and better cars. But not necessarily race cars, but cars with a racing pedigree that could have been driven on the roads. Porsche was known as the “daily driver supercar”. It was true for most of its models. But then, some serious track-oriented cars appeared such as the GT3 or GT3 RS. But to drive one of those on public roads was harsh. The stiff suspension and almost completely stripped-out interiors didn't make them fit for a daily driver. The Carrera GTS was built for regular roads, but it had some aces in its sleeve to handle a race-track. Its appearance was different. The smoked bi-Xenon headlights lowered suspension, and its pop-up rear wing was part of a complete street and track package. The Porsche Turbo S wheels and the carbo-ceramic brakes offered as an option steered the car toward the race-track. On top of that, the car received more power and a standard Porsche PDK (dual-clutch gearbox) for both worlds: street and tracks).",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Porsche Carrera GTS Coupe"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": ""varied"",  ""overall-design"": [""iconic"", ""timeless"", ""powerful"", ""sporty"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""smoked"", ""bi-Xenon""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""Porsche Turbo S""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""pop-up""],    ""exhaust"": [""sporty""]  }}```"
PORSCHE 911 Targa 4 GTS,"Porsche introduced the GTS version for the 911 family in 2011 as a perfect balance between performance and daily driving experience, and, in 2021, it added that option for the 992 generation. The Targa version was already a unique presence on the sports car market. Porsche designed it on top of the 911 Cabriolet version but added a massive system with servomotors and a large glass panel that opened and closed at a touch of a button. The LED headlights received darkened areas for the GTS version, while other black elements adorned the front side scoops and the rear diffuser. Also, the thick B-pillar, specific for the Targa version, was piano-black regardless of the car’s color. Porsche didn’t have too much imagination for the interior and placed black trims all over the place. The instrument panel was similar to the rest of the 992 range but adorned it with the GTS lettering inside the analog tachometer. The rest of the dials were digital. Integrated above the center stack, the PCM (Porsche Communication Management) screen of the infotainment system matched the black color of the dashboard when turned off. The Targa 4GTS was the best of all worlds, providing all-wheel-drive traction, an open-top experience, and a fixed-roof feeling in the same car. Its automatic transmission and adaptive suspension completed the image of a daily-driver sports car.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""911 Targa 4GTS"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""balanced"", ""unique"", ""sporty"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""large"", ""curved""],    ""grille"": [""black""],    ""hood"": [""N/A""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""darkened""],    ""bumper"": [""black""],    ""wheel"": [""N/A""],    ""doors"": [""N/A""],    ""roof"": [""glass"", ""automatic""],    ""diffusor"": [""black"", ""rear""],    ""spoiler"": [""N/A""],    ""exhaust"": [""N/A""]  }}```"
PORSCHE Macan GTS,"Porsche gave a seventh-anniversary present to the Macan and gave it an improved, more powerful version for the GTS range along with some other visual and technical updates. While the Porsche purists were outraged by the introduction of the Porsche Cayenne, stating that the carmaker should stick only to sports cars, the customers were thrilled. Eventually, the Cayenne became the biggest money-maker for the German brand. But, soon, the voices of the nay-sayers were turned down again with the addition of the Panamera and, in 2014, by the Macan. The 2021 model was still based on the same platform as the Audi Q5, but apart from the MLB platform, the GTS was completely different. Its exterior design was improved over the 2016 model year. Its front fascia featured a broad black grille that covered the mid-section of the bumper from side to side. Its LED DRL's underlined the swept-back headlights, which received Porsche Dynamic Light System (PLDS) fitted as standard. Porsche fitted a new center console inside the Macan GTS, enhanced with touch controls instead of physic buttons and with a shorter gear selector. In addition, the carmaker now installed the analog clock on top of the dashboard as a standard feature. But the biggest changes were for the drivetrain. The engine received a boost of 60 hp over its predecessor, reaching 440 ponies from the same 2.9-liter turbocharged engine. In addition, Porsche stiffened the Macan's air suspension, and the ground clearance dropped by 10 mm (0.4"") when compared to the rest of its siblings.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Macan"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""improved"", ""sleek"", ""powerful"", ""sophisticated"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""swept-back""],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""black""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""mid-section""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PORSCHE Panamera 4S Diesel,"Having a car that could travel in all weather conditions and spend more time on the road between refills could define a good long-range traveler. The Panamera 4S Diesel was just like that. The Europeans were the keenest to receive an oil-burner Panamera and, being a Porsche, it automatically came with performances good enough for any long journeys. Moreover, having an all-wheel-drive system means that it could be a good choice for someone who wants to go skiing in Sweeden while living on the shores of the Mediterranean sea. 2016 started right with an already established name on the market and the look was way better. The rear end was looking sort of a 911, but better. The designers tried to build a short hood and moved a part of the engine under the windshield area. The headlights were very similar to those on the 911 and the car had great success. Inside, the touch-screen mania caught well and some buttons from the center console and from the dashboard disappeared. A 12.3"" touch-screen infotainment unit found its way onto the dashboard. It was nicely integrated but without an Android Auto connection. The Porsche marketing department said that its users are mostly iPhone users, so they matched it only with Apple CarPlay. The Android phone users had to download a special Porsche app that could work with the unit. The dashboard featured an analog tachometer in the middle, a tribute to the Porsche 356. On the sides, two 7"" TFT screens could show various information about the car, bord-computer, navigation, etc. The Panamera 4S Diesel was powered by a twin-turbo V8 unit. It offered 422 hp, which was one of the most powerful oil-burner cars on the market. It was paired to an 8-speed automatic transmission and sent its power to all four wheels.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Panamera 4S Diesel"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""modern"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""short"", ""integrated""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""short""],    ""headlights"": [""similar to 911""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PORSCHE Panamera GTS,"The Panamera GTS was the sportiest version of the Panamera range, placed right below the Turbo version. Its look and performance and the active suspension made the car sportier than the 4S version. In 2013, Porsche started to offer the long-wheelbase version, named Executive, on specific markets with specific engine versions. Since the 2020 model year, it started to offer that option on more markets, and with an option for Sport Tourismo (shooting brake) as well. For the 2020 model, the Panamera GTS featured a redesigned front fascia, with a different bumper and lower apron. The previously optional Sport Design front end was featured as standard on the facelifted version. In the back, the revamped light strip ran seamlessly over the trunk lid, with an adapted contour and new LED taillights were installed. The three-piece retractable wing was kept. The GTS version featured a new darkened Exclusive Design tail light clusters as standard with dynamic coming/leaving home function. The interior of the 2020 Panamera 4 featured the already known Porsche Communication Management infotainment system with a 12.3” touch-screen display mounted at the same level as the steering wheel, on top of the center stack. It featured the improved Voice Pilot online voice control and wireless Apple CarPlay. Porsche didn't say anything about the Android Auto connectivity. The 2020 Panamera GTS engine was upgraded and gained 20 hp over its predecessor. The rear-wheel-drive sport-sedan offered 480 hp from its 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine.

PORSCHE Panamera 4S,"Porsche dreamed about a 4-door saloon hard and long until it got real. The original prototype was in the late '80s and it was named 989. But it wasn't real until the first Panamera appeared, a car that made the same numbers of friends and enemies. The second generation of the Panamera showed up in 2016 and its design fixed all the problems of the first generation. The nice look of a four-door coupe, combined with the exterior details of the vehicle, made it up for those who waited and trusted the Porsche brand. It looked like a stretched 911 model, but with the engine in the front. The 4-LED headlights fitted as standard were one of the key design elements that made the car attractive. The Panamera 4S featured 19” light-alloy wheels and only two colors as standard: black and white as standard. The infotainment system can be paired with either a Bose or a Burmeister premium sound system for a better audio quality offered as an option. The system can be paired with a smartphone via a Porsche dedicated app. The Android Auto was not available. For the engines, the Panamera 4S was available wither with a V6-gasoline, twin-turbo, or with a turbodiesel unit.

PORSCHE Panamera 4 E-Hybrid Sport Turismo,"Part of an expansion of the second-generation Panamera lineup, the Porsche Panamera 4 E-Hybrid Sport Turismo is essentially a shooting brake plug-in hybrid. As the first Panamera with a 4+1 seating concept available as standard (two individual seats in the rear are optional), the Sport Turismo is almost as family friendly as a Cayenne, but with added performance and most of all, style. In 4 E-Hybrid guise, the model is powered by not one, but two powertrains: a twin-turbocharged, 2.9-liter V6 and an electric motor. Despite developing a similar output as the six-cylinder powering the Panamera 4 Sport Turismo, the six-cylinder in the plug-in hybrid model uses twin-turbocharging in a “hot vee” design, where the turbos sit inside the V of the engine. With 330 horsepower and 450 Nm of torque on tap, the internal combustion engine (ICE) is augmented by an electric motor that brings an additional 136 horsepower and 400 Nm of torque. When working together in hybrid mode, the 4 E-Hybrid Sport Turismo delivers a maximum system output of 462 horsepower and 700 Nm of torque. In the NEDC cycle the average fuel economy is 2.5l/100 km, but there is also an all-electric mode thanks to a small lithium-ion battery, which gives the model an EV range of up to 51 kilometers.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Porsche Panamera 4 E-Hybrid Sport Turismo"",  ""year"": ""second-generation"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""family-friendly"", ""performance-oriented"", ""stylish""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""twin-turbocharged"", ""hot vee design""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PORSCHE 911 Turbo,"With each generation of the Porsche Turbo, the car received more power and more technological enhancements. The 2020 911 Turbo was no exception, and it remained a great balance between high-performance and luxury items. The first generation of the Turbo was introduced in 1975 and it offered 260 hp. 35 years later it added 380 hp on top of that and, since the 993 generation, an all-wheel-drive system. The exterior might not be as aggressive as some other Porsche models, such as the GT3 or GT2, but the new front apron was a form-follow-function concept. The three big air-intakes looked like there was a trade between the engine department and the brakes department who will get more room for cooling. The car featured 20” front wheels and 21” rear wheels. Under the engine lid, the car-maker installed cooling fans and air-intercoolers. The side scoops, a characteristic for the 911 Turbo, were used to charge air. Also in the back, a big retractable wing was installed. Inside, the Turbo featured a completely new dashboard. The tachometer was the only analog gauge in the instrument cluster. It was complemented on its sides by two other TFT displays. In the dashboard, at the same level as the sport steering wheel with paddle-shifters, there was the screen for the PCM (Porsche Communication Management) infotainment unit. A light pack offered slimmer and lighter seats, instead of the 14-way power-adjustable ones for the front occupants. The engineering part of the car was the biggest improvement. It offered a newly developed, direct-injected 3.75-liter engine. It was fed by a pair of VTG turbochargers (variable turbocharged geometry) with a total result of 580 hp (40 hp more than its predecessor). It was paired to a standard 8-speed PDK (dual-clutch) automatic transmission with an option for a 7-speed manual.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""911 Turbo"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""20” front wheels, 21” rear wheels"",  ""overall-design"": [""high-performance"", ""luxury"", ""aggressive"", ""functional"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""new front apron""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""20” front wheels"", ""21” rear wheels""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""big retractable wing""],    ""exhaust"": [""pair of VTG turbochargers""]  }}```"
PORSCHE Panamera 4 Sport Turismo,"While the Panamera started to get more attention from the customers, Porsche listened to their desires for more trunk space and introduced the Sport Tourismo version. Unveiled at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show, the new body version was more of a shooting-brake than a station-wagon. It still offered the same drivetrain and the same luxurious interior, but with more room in the back and still be able to look good. It looked more like a lowered Macan than a station-wagon Panamera. Its raked rear looked like it was there to enhance the aerodynamic rather than increase the cargo area. Yet, that tailgate was designed for both. And since it didn't want to mimic the rear-end of a 911, it might be just the better solution. The extra set of rear windows, behind the C-pillars, actually enhanced the visibility over the regular Panamera. Inside, the Turbo Sport Tourismo looked just like the regular Panamera. It lost the multi-button center console arranged like on a Vertu mobile phone. It had the same haptic buttons on a display. Also, the infotainment unit was large and had a fast-responsive touch-screen. It supported only Apple CarPlay. The longer roof-line allowed a higher rear door and easier access to the three seats in the back. The trunk was larger by 25 liters (0.9 cu-ft) than the one on the regular Panamera. It was the first Porsche Panamera available with up to five seats. For the powertrain, the Panamera Sport Tourismo featured a twin-turbo V6 engine mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission and a rear-wheel-drive system. To keep the car planted on the road, a set of adaptive suspension was added to the cocktail.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Panamera Sport Tourismo"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""larger trunk"",  ""overall-design"": [""shooting-brake style"", ""luxurious interior"", ""raked rear"", ""enhanced aerodynamics"", ""longer roof-line""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""easier access""],    ""roof"": [""longer roof-line""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PORSCHE 911 Targa 4,"The best compromise between a convertible and a coupe was a Targa bodywork. It used to be the right answer for a stiff construction and the beauty of driving under the sky. While the first models featured a plastic rear window and a soft top, the 2020 Porsche Targa 4 model featured a wide panoramic rear windscreen without a C-pillar and a soft top that was retracted at the push of a button and disappeared in 19 seconds behind the cabin. The front side of the car was impressive with the new design for the bumper and apron. It was like the engine department and the brakes department struggled to get more air-scoops in the front of the car, and the result was an almost even distribution for all of them. The B-pillar was silver regardless of the car's color. In the back, the third brake-light mimicked the 11 number when it was lit. Inside, the Carrera 4 was fitted with all the comfort and luxurious items required by an exclusive sports-car as the Porsche 911. The sport seats and the finishes had a premium look. The instrument cluster featured the classic five-dials, but only the tachometer was analog. The other four were TFT displays. A 10.9” screen for the PCM (Porsche Communication Management) was installed in the middle of the dashboard. The flat-six under the engine lid was a 3.0-liter turbocharged engine that cranked up 385 hp. It was mated as standard with the new 8-speed automatic (PDK) transmission, but a 7-speed manual was available at no extra cost. The all-wheel-drive system was enhanced for fuel-efficiency.

PORSCHE Panamera,"In 2020, while the world was struggling with the COVID 19 pandemic, Porsche remained true to its promises and brought the facelifted version for the second generation of the Panamera. The base model from the Panamera was a rear-wheel-drive luxury sport-sedan. It was the entry-level, but it wasn't a basic car. The facelifted version brought even more features than before, but it was still a rear-wheel-drive, twin-turbo V6 vehicle. For the 2020 model, the Panamera featured a redesigned front fascia, with a different bumper and lower apron. The previously optional Sport Design front end was featured as standard on the facelifted version. In the back, the revamped light strip ran seamlessly over the trunk lid, with an adapted contour and new LED taillights were installed. The three-piece retractable wing was kept. The interior of the 2020 Panamera featured the already known Porsche Communication Management infotainment system with a 12.3” touch-screen display mounted at the same level as the steering wheel, on top of the center stack. It featured the improved Voice Pilot online voice control and wireless Apple CarPlay. Porsche didn't say anything about the Android Auto connectivity. Under the hood, the Porsche Panamera featured a twin-turbo V6 engine, good for 330 hp. It was carried-over from the non-facelifted version.

PORSCHE Panamera 4,"After four years from the introduction of the Panamera's second generation, Porsche introduced its facelifted version. Some updates were required by new regulations and some for improvement's sake. In 2013, Porsche started to offer the long-wheelbase version, named Executive, on specific markets with specific engine versions. Since the 2020 model year, it started to offer that option on more markets, and with an option for Sport Tourismo (shooting brake) as well.

PORSCHE Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid,"By combining a Porsche Panamera Turbo with the hybrid system already developed for the 4 E-Hybrid, the result was a 680 hp monster which was environmentally friendly. Porsche was one of the pioneers of hybrid mobility since the Lohner-Porsche model unveiled in 1900 at the Paris Exhibition. More than a century later, the German carmaker chose the same city to show its evolved hybrid vehicle. The second generation of the Panamera showed up in 2016 and its design fixed all the problems of the first generation. The nice look of a four-door coupe, combined with the exterior details of the vehicle, made it up for those who waited and trusted the Porsche brand. It looked like a stretched 911 model, but with the engine in the front. The 4-LED headlights fitted as standard were one of the key design elements that made the car attractive. As a distinctive detail, the 4 E-Hybrid featured the electric-green brake calipers and the green “hybrid” badges on the fenders and on the trunk lid. The interior was fitted with a wide 12.3” touch-screen as a central PCM (Porsche Communication Management) unit mounted at the same level as the steering wheel, on the center stack. It was for accessing various information and setting for the hybrid system as well. The hybrid system deserved most of the attention. It was the first all-wheel-drive Panamera hybrid. It was fitted with a more powerful electric motor and a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8 gasoline engine. The powerplant was fitted to an 8-speed PDK (dual-clutch) gearbox. Its predecessors were fitted with rear-wheel-drive only. The Panamera 4 E-hybrid always started in electric mode and turned on its gasoline unit later. That helped the car to achieve a 50 km (31 miles) of electric range.

PORSCHE Panamera GTS Sport Turismo,"Despite being built as a rear-wheel-drive only, the Panamera GTS Sport Tourismo was closer to the Turbo version rather than the S-version. Its look was sportier and it the performances were no joke. The Porsche Panamera Sport Tourismo was a good example of how a station-wagon can get better. For some, it looked even better than the regular Panamera. In terms of practicality, it featured a bigger trunk and more headroom for the rear passengers. For the 2020 model year, the facelifted version received few updates. The 2020 model Panamera Sport Tourismo GTS featured a different front fascia than the rest of the range, with new grilles in the GTS specific darkened apron. It was fitted with standard LED headlights. On the sides, the 20” light-alloy wheels featured a specific design. In the back, the rectangular exhausts under the apron improved the car's look. The roof-spoiler installed on top of the tailgate featured the third brake light. Inside, there was not uncommon to see sport-bucket seats in a Porsche. What was unusual was that the Sport Tourismo had that option for the rear seats as well, or it could have been fitted with a bench for three adults. On the dashboard, it featured the already known Porsche Communication Management infotainment system with a 12.3” touch-screen display mounted at the same level as the steering wheel, on top of the center stack.

PORSCHE 911 Turbo Cabriolet,"In 2016, the 991 generation of the Porsche 911 received a mid-life cycle refresh and it was introduced to the market. The Porsche Turbo Cabriolet was enhanced as well. Ever since 1974, the introduction of a Porsche Turbo was a hot moment for Porsche enthusiasts. With the convertible versions, the famous supercar became more appealing for those who were looking for a daily-driver supercar and with the special appealing of an open-top. Moreover, since the 911 Turbo proved to be a great all-weather car, due to its all-wheel-drive system. The facelifted version of the 991 was named 991.2. The car's front end was redesigned with side air blades and narrow LED lights, with double fillets to emphasize the car's width, as the additional fin in the main air intake. From the side, the new 20” light-alloy wheels were fitted as standard. The door handles without recess covers gave the car a sleeker look. The three-layer power-roof could have been opened or closed in 13 seconds at speeds up to 50 kph (31 mph). Inside, the new Porsche Communication Management (PCM) with navigation system was fitted as standard. The system featured a 7” touch-screen on the center stack. Unlike its predecessors, the new PCM featured Google Maps with real-time traffic information and Google StreetView.

The infotainment system can be paired with either a Bose or a Burmeister premium sound system for a better audio quality offered as an option. The system can be paired with a smartphone via a Porsche dedicated app. The Android Auto was not available. The standard, 14-way adjustable seats could have been upgraded to an 18-way pair of seats. The Panamera Turbo was the best balance between performance, luxury, and comfort. The new, 4.0-liter twin-turbo engine offered 30 hp more than its predecessor, despite having a smaller displacement.

PORSCHE 718 Cayman GT4,"Porsche introduced the 718 GT4 RS in 2022 as one of the best sports cars on the market, and that was not just a marketing line since the vehicle was packed with true racing technologies, including the engine. With its mid-engine layout, two seats, and not too much luggage space, the 718 Cayman GT4 RS was clearly in a different market segment than its more famous sibling, the 911. In addition, thanks to the engine carried over from the 911 GT3 Cup race car, it was supercar-fast. On the outside, the car showed its sporty character from every angle. At the front, the automaker placed an air dam fitted with an extended chin at the bottom to increase downforce and a massive grille above it that cooled the radiators behind it. Strangely, the air intakes that cooled the brakes were on the hood, which was made from carbon fiber. Porsche used the same ultralight and strong material to make the front fenders, which sported exhaust vents at their top to extract the air trapped in the wheel wells, thus reducing lift. From its sides, the curved greenhouse was neatly sloped down, and instead of small rear windows, it featured air intakes for the engine. Finally, the automaker placed a swan-neck wing and a small ducktail at the back. Inside, the carmaker added Alcantara on the dash, gear selector, steering wheel, and door cards. The sports seats featured holes for race harnesses for those who wanted to race the car. In front of the driver, the 718 Cayman GT4 RS featured an instrument cluster filled with a mix of analog and digital displays. Porsche installed a 500 PS (493 hp) flat-six turbocharged engine mated to a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) PDK gearbox.

PORSCHE 911 Carrera S,"The newest Porsche 911 brings more fun and pleasure to drive than the generation it replaces. It was always like that except for 996 generation. Now they are offering only turbocharged engines, regardless the version. The new 992 generation is wider by 45 mm (1.77 in) on the front and the all-wheel-drive model is also wider with 44 mm (1.73 in) on the rear than the generation it replaces. A new feature may be noticed at the front headlights, which are full LED. No more xenon or, even worse, regular halogen lightbulbs. The interior was reworked and features two LCDs inside the instrument cluster, flanking the classical rev-counter, which has been kept analog. Also, on the center console, there is a 10.9-inch display used for the PCM (Porsche Communication Management) and supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The system also supports an online navigation system, with real-time data for the traffic ahead. The engine is, as usual, a flat-six cylinder with twin-turbochargers. The total output is higher with 30 HP than the previous generation, reaching an impressive 450 HP. Imagine that the last air-cooled Porsche 911 (993) had 408 HP. The transmission used exclusively is an 8-speed dual-clutch gearbox (PDK), and ensures faster gear changes. The new 911 Carrera S lapped the famous Nurburgring Nordschleife in 7minutes 25 seconds.

PORSCHE 911 Carrera Cabriolet,"The Porsche Carrera Cabriolet was introduced along with the Carrera Coupe, in July 2019. It offered 15 hp more than its predecessor and an open-top to enjoy the drive. There was a long road between the first, naturally aspirated, Porsche 911, and the 2021 Carrera Coupe. While the first 911 was for pure sports driving experience, the eighth generation was a mix of performance, elegance, luxury, and exclusivity. The front side of the car featured the same round headlights design but evolved. It featured the four-dots LED daytime running lights signature. The bigger apron in the front featured bigger air-intakes since the Carrera featured a twin-turbo engine and it wasn't naturally aspirated anymore. The flush to the bodywork pop-out door handles looked smooth. Interestingly, the car was fitted with 19” light-alloy wheels at the front and 20” for the rear axle. Behind the rear seats, there was the storage area for the soft-top. A big panel will go back and the roof will disappear underneath. With the roof up, the sleek form of the classic 911 shape was kept. In the back, on the soft-top storage compartment's lid, the third stop-light showed the 11 number when it was lit. Inside, the Carrera Cabriolet was fitted with all the comfort and luxurious items required by an exclusive sports-car as the Porsche 911. The sport seats and the finishes had a premium look. The instrument cluster featured the classic five-dials, but only the tachometer was analog. The other four were TFT displays. A 10.9” screen for the PCM (Porsche Communication Management) was installed in the middle of the dashboard.

PORSCHE Macan Turbo,"The facelifted version of the Macan Turbo has arrived in showrooms in 2019. It is based on the same MLB platform used for the first generation Audi Q5 since 2007. But the new Macan received extensive other features, which make it look better and move faster than before. Under the hood there is a new 2.9-liter V6 bi-turbo engine with 440 hp. Its displacement is 20 percent smaller than the previous model, but gives a lot more punch. The sprint from 0 to 100 kph (62 mph) can be achieved in 4.3 seconds. It benefits from the latest evolution of the PDK gearbox (Dual-clutch system) and transfers the torque to all four wheels. As an option, Porsche offers a height-adjustable air suspension, which can stiffen during hard cornering, and also has a vectoring traction system (Porsche Torque Vectoring), which sends more torque to the wheel with the best traction. For stopping power, the Macan Turbo can be equipped with ceramic brakes. The 20” wheels are standard. Inside, there is a Bose surround sound system, but, as usual with the Porsche brand, only connectivity with Apple CarPlay is available. It still doesn't works for Android users.

PORSCHE 911 Carrera 4S Cabriolet,"The 992 generation of the famous Porsche 911 was unveiled in 2018 at the Los Angeles Auto Show. Only six weeks later, the open-top Carrera 4S was introduced to the market. There was a long history for the powerful, convertible, Porsche 911. The Carrera 4S featured a mix of parts from the Turbo model and the lower specs Carrera. The final touch to the mix was the Carrera 4S Cabriolet, that combined performance and the roadster sensation offered by the open-top vehicle. The new Carrera 4S 992 generation was wider by 45 mm (1.77”) on the front and with 44 mm (1.73”) on the rear than the generation it replaced. The standard headlights were with full LEDs. The front end resembled a traditional feature from earlier 911 generations: a forward-extended hood with a distinctive recess in front of the windscreen. The interior was reworked and featured two LCDs inside the instrument cluster, flanking the classical tachometer, which was analog. Also, on the center console, there was a 10.9-inch display used for the PCM (Porsche Communication Management) that supported Apple CarPlay but not Android Auto. The system also featured an online navigation system, with real-time data for the traffic ahead. To open or close the car, a new soft top and mechanism were installed.

PORSCHE 911 Carrera 4 GTS,"After 12 years since the introduction of the GTS version in the Porsche 911 family, the German carmaker launched a new edition for the 992 generation. In 2019 Porsche launched a new generation for its iconic 911 model, named 992. The plans were to make a GTS version in a year or so, but due to the pandemic situation that struck the world in 2020, those plans were postponed, and the GTS appeared on the market two and a half years later. Still, Porsche fans were patiently waiting for it since it represented one of the best price/performance versions in the 911 range. On the outside, the carmaker did a few touches here and there to emphasize the differences between the GTS and the non-GTS versions. The LED headlights received darkened areas, while other black elements adorned the front side scoops, the splitter, rocker panels, and the front of the rear fenders. Inside, the carmaker relied on the same instrument cluster with an analog tachometer in the middle flanked by digital screens as the rest of the 992 range. The PCM infotainment system provided connectivity with both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and its screen sat above the center stack. Also, black was the dominant interior color of the car. Porsche built the 992 GTS with rear or all-wheel-drive, and in all three body versions: coupe, convertible, and Targa. The re-tuned flat-six engine provided 30 more ponies than the 911 Carrera S and the previous 921 GTS version.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Porsche 911"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""sporty"", ""modern"", ""elegant"", ""aggressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""subtle"", ""curved""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""darkened""],    ""bumper"": [""black elements""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""re-tuned""]  }}```"
PORSCHE 911 Carrera 4S,"Introduced at the 2018 Los Angeles Motor Show, the Porsche 911 Carrera 4S showed an important evolution compared to the previous generation. It is the eighth generation of the German sports car manufacturer from Stuttgart. The 911 always had that great spirit of attraction and the eighth generation didn't lose its steam. The eighth generation of the Porsche 911 came with full LED headlights fitted as standard, and an optional, adaptive, Matrix-LED was available on extra-cost. Other safety features were included such as traffic sign recognition or the Lane Change Assist. For the night drive, a Night Vision Assist used an intelligent thermal imaging camera that detects persons and animals and shows them to the driver. It has a range of up to 300 meters (984 ft). For the infotainment system, Porsche was fitted as standard with a 10.9” touchscreen display. For the sound system, up to three options are available, from Bose or Burmeister. The top version had 855 Watts. The PCM (Porsche Communication Management) can connect to Apple and Android users via Porsche Connect App. It is still not able to connect to Android Auto app. The most important update is under the hood, where the twin-turbo engine offered 450 hp, which was mated to a standard 8-speed dual-clutch gearbox. The performance gain over the previous generation is important and had a 0-100 kph (0-62 mph) of 3.6 seconds, 0.4 faster than its predecessor.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Porsche 911 Carrera 4S"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""elegant"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloping""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""streamlined""],    ""headlights"": [""full LED"", ""adaptive Matrix-LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""twin-turbo""]  }}```"
PORSCHE Cayenne GTS,"The return to the V8 engine for the Porsche Cayenne GTS was a milestone for the German SUV: it was the first time when the GTS outpowered the first generation of the Cayenne Turbo. When the first generation of the Cayenne was introduced to the market, its top-model was the 450 hp Turbo version. Over time, a naturally aspirated V8 was offered for the GTS range, which was downsized to a twin-turbo V6 unit. From 2020, the GTS kept a pair of turbochargers but moved back to a V8 unit. It was, again, one of the best-balanced options for the Cayenne. The twin horizontal blades on the front grilles, the vertical slats that divided the three-wide air-intakes on the apron and the LED bars under the headlights were just one of the few strong points of the 2020 Cayenne GTS. In the back, the raked D-pillar with the roof-spoiler on top of the tailgate inspired force and performance. Four big round exhausts were installed under the rear apron. Inside, the Cayenne GTS featured the new 12.3” Full-HD touch-screen from the Porsche Communication Management infotainment system. For the instrument cluster, only the tachometer remained analog and it was flanked by two 7” displays, needed for other relevant driving data. The front sport-seats featured the GTS logo embroiled on their backseat. The Alcantara upholstery and the red stitches were part of the version's sporty appeal. For the drivetrain, the Cayenne GTS was fitted with a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8 engine. It offered 20 hp more than its predecessor, reaching 460 hp. It was paired to a standard 8-speed automatic gearbox. Due to the sport suspension, it sat 20 mm (0.8”) lower than the rest of the Cayenne S.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Cayenne GTS"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""powerful"", ""sporty"", ""balanced"", ""performance-oriented"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""twin horizontal blades"", ""vertical slats"", ""three-wide air-intakes""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED bars""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""raked D-pillar"", ""roof-spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""four big round exhausts""]  }}```"
PORSCHE Macan,"In July 2018, Porsche unveiled a new facelift for the Macan range in Shanghai. The production started the following month and the Europeans saw it at the Paris Motor Show in September. The sales went well for the smaller Porsche SUV and new customers started to find their ways to Porsche dealers. Since the brand started to build vehicles for more tastes, it didn't attract only supercars lovers and racing maniacs. Its main advantage was an awesome heritage in the motoring industry and a high-quality product range. The revised Macan featured standard LED headlights and a new design for the taillights, which were LED as well. The new apron with a wide design for the grille made the car look wider than it was, enhancing the sporty look. The interior was slightly enhanced with the introduction of an 11” touch-screen infotainment display on the center stack. It was fitted with the Porsche Communication Management, which was Apple CarPlay compatible. The biggest improvement was on the technological side, where a new traffic assist function helped the driver in traffic jams. Not only that it kept the same distance with the car in front, accelerating and braking, but it kept its lane as well. Under the hood, the 2018 Macan featured a revised 2.0-liter turbocharged engine from Audi. It was offered in two power outputs. Both of them were paired with a 7-speed PDK (dual-clutch) automatic transmission. The most important update was the gasoline particulate filter, which reduced emissions.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Macan"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""smaller SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""wide"", ""high-quality"", ""enhanced"", ""technological""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wide""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PORSCHE Panamera Turbo S,"While the Porsche Panamera Turbo was the best of both worlds in terms of luxury and performance, the Turbo S version tilted the scale toward the sports area. The Panamera Turbo got the fastest lap-time in the sport-sedan segment for the famous Nurburgring Nordschleife of 7m28.81. Its time was better than the one recorded by other supercars such as Koenigsegg CCX, Pagani Zonda F, or even the 2007 Porsche 911 GT2. And the Panamera S was even quicker and faster, but not tested. For the 2020 model, the Panamera Turbo S featured a different front fascia than the rest of the range, with new grilles in the apron and two pairs of light strips for the daytime running lights. It was fitted with standard LED headlights. On the sides, the 21” light-alloy wheels featured a specific design. In the back, the revamped light strip ran seamlessly over the trunk lid, with an adapted contour and new LED taillights were installed. The three-piece retractable wing was kept. The big, quad, exhaust in the rear offered a deeper sound than before. The interior of the 2020 Panamera Turbo S featured the already known Porsche Communication Management infotainment system with a 12.3” touch-screen display mounted at the same level as the steering wheel, on top of the center stack. It featured the improved Voice Pilot online voice control and wireless Apple CarPlay. Porsche didn't say anything about the Android Auto connectivity. The 2020 Panamera Turbo S featured the same twin-turbo V8 engine as the GTS or the Turbo version but tuned to offer 630 hp. It offered 80 hp more than the non-facelift Panamera Turbo. Its performances were on par with other supercars, obtaining a 3.1 second for the 0 to 100 kph (0 to 62 mph) run.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Panamera Turbo S"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxury"", ""performance"", ""sporty"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""new"", ""apron"", ""front""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""daytime running"", ""standard""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""21-inch"", ""light-alloy"", ""specific design""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""three-piece retractable""],    ""exhaust"": [""quad"", ""deeper sound"", ""rear""]  }}```"
PORSCHE Cayenne Turbo,"In 2017, the third generation of the Porsche Cayenne was unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show. Its top model was the Cayenne Turbo, with 550 hp under the hood. The third generation came to fix what its predecessor was criticized for: the exterior design. While the second generation featured some details that could remind of a Hyundai, the third generation was completely new from tip to toe. On the outside, there was four LED for the running lights incorporated into the headlights. The actual shape of the headlights was inspired by the 918 supercars. For the Turbo version, there was a different bumper with a lower splitter and a very wide grille that visually made the car look wider. Not like it wasn't wide enough. From the side, some subtle sculptured doors and fenders helped the car's aerodynamic. In the rear, a roof-spoiler incorporated the third stop-light. The rectangular exhaust pipes were peaking on both sides of the rear diffuser. Inside, there was a mixed feeling about the car, with some elements typical for a sports car and some others for an SUV. On the three-spoke steering wheel, there was a rotary knob for the driving settings from comfort mode to sports. The instrument cluster was a mix between analog and digital. The tachometer was analog, but on the sides, it featured TFT displays for navigation and vehicle settings. On the main infotainment screen, there was the navigation system and the audio. It featured only Apple CarPlay connectivity. Under the hood, the Cayenne Turbo featured a 4.0-liter V8 unit with two turbochargers.

PORSCHE 911 Carrera 4 Cabriolet,"The 2012 Porsche Carrera 4 Cabriolet was that daily-driver supercar that could take its top off in 13 seconds and run away with its 350 hp delivered to its all-wheel-drive system. And that only a part of the fun. Porsche always had open-top vehicles. Looking back, it had a glorious roadster over the years. Some of them were meant for racing and performance. But there was a switch toward the luxurious convertibles, with high-performance and able to be used as a daily driver car. The 2012 Carrera 4 Cabriolet kept the same unmistakably shape of the timeless Porsche 911 design convertible since 1982. On the front, the same rounded headlights shape, but with LED lights, were like a trademark for the vehicle. Over time, the windshield became more angled to improve the aerodynamic and, in the rear, the sloped back with the engine compartment. Inside the Carrera 4 Cabriolet, there were some luxury features. The leather-covered sport-bucket seats were covered in leather. The canvas top was hidden behind a large, rigid cover, behind the rear very small seats. The center console was higher to give the driver a sense of a single-seat racing roadster. For the sound system, the German car-manufacturer offered few options, including a premium sound system from Burmeister sound specialist. For the transmission, Porsche offered a 7-speed manual as standard or a 7-speed dual-clutch PDK system. The 7-speed manual had an interesting feature that prevents the driver to accidentally downshift from 7th to 4th, which could damage the engine.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Porsche Carrera 4 Cabriolet"",  ""year"": ""2012"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""timeless"", ""luxurious"", ""high-performance"", ""convertible"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""angled"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""rounded""],    ""headlights"": [""rounded"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""leather-covered""],    ""roof"": [""canvas"", ""rigid""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PORSCHE 911 Carrera GTS Cabriolet,"When combining a seriously fast car with an open-top, the result should be a roadster. Porsche decided to make a vehicle lineup with track performances but daily usability. And then, chopped its roof and made it a Cabriolet. The Porsche 911 Carrera GTS Convertible was launched in 2014. It was the open-top version for the Carrera 4 GTS. It featured the same exterior details such as the Porsche Turbo S wheels, carbo-ceramic brakes, and the rear pop-up wing. The lowered suspension increased the cornering speed ability. The Carrera GTS was made to be a bridge between the Carrera S and the Carrera GT3. Even if it didn't feature the all-wheel-steering system, it was still very fast and able to tackle a race-track with honorable results. The GTS offered 30 more hp than the S and that was applied on the Cabriolet as well. Inside, there was room for two passengers, even if there was a pair of seats in the back. Even the manufacturer recognized that nobody could be seated there and this is why it trimmed only the front seats in Alcantara. From the performance point of view, the Carrera 4 GTS Cabriolet was slower than the Carrera 4 GTS Coupe. But in terms of leisure and open-top driving, it did offer a different perspective. And it wasn't a slow car whatsoever.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Porsche 911 Carrera GTS Convertible"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""fast"", ""open-top"", ""track performance"", ""daily usability"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""open-top""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""chopped"", ""convertible""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""Porsche Turbo S""],    ""doors"": [""two passengers""],    ""roof"": [""open-top""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""rear pop-up wing""],    ""exhaust"": [""fast""]  }}```"
PORSCHE Panamera 4S Sport Turismo,"Unveiled at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show, the Porsche Panamera Sport Turismo was offered in five different versions, depending on the engine. The 4S was considered a well-balanced version in terms of price per value. The 2017 Panamera Sport Tourismo was more like a shooting-brake than a station-wagon. More like a lowered Macan than a station-wagon Panamera. Its raked rear looked like it was there to enhance the aerodynamic rather than increase the cargo area. Yet, that tailgate was designed for both. And since it didn't want to mimic the rear-end of a 911, it might be just the better solution. Inside, the Turbo Sport Tourismo looked just like the regular Panamera. It lost the multi-button center console arranged like on a Vertu mobile phone. It had the same haptic buttons on a display. Also, the infotainment unit was large and had a fast-responsive touch-screen. It supported only Apple CarPlay. The longer roof-line allowed a higher rear door and easier access to the three seats in the back. The trunk was larger by 25 liters (0.9 cu-ft) than the one on the regular Panamera. It was the first Porsche Panamera available with up to five seats. For the powertrain, the 4s Sport Tourismo featured a twin-turbo V6 engine mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission and an all-wheel-drive system.

PORSCHE Cayenne Turbo Coupe,"This is how the Cayenne should've looked since the beginning if the Porsche Board would have had guts! But now they fixed it and it looks great. Not too bulky not too flat, just impressive and bold. By chopping the roof by almost one inch (20mm) from a regular Cayenne Turbo, Porsche designers made the A-pillars shallower and the back seats have smaller headroom, but thanks to the lower rear seats position compared with the Cayenne Turbo by 30 mm, this will not be such a problem. On the outside, a 5 dollar look fixed-lip spoiler on the tailgate differentiates the Turbo version from the rest of the range. Usually, there were some big aesthetic differences between the Turbo and the others, but now these are very subtle. Big wheels, big brakes and yellow brake-calipers can be ordered on both the Cayenne S and Turbo versions. The guys with regular Cayenne Coupes will have to paint them by themselves. The engine, though, it is what we expected. A 4.0-liter V8 twin-turbo engine that offers 550 HP and 770 Nm (568 lb-ft) of torque. This is coupled with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The performances are neck-breaking for an SUV. First 62 mph (100 kph) can be reached in just 3.9 seconds and the top speed is 178 MPH (286 KPH).",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Cayenne"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""not too bulky"",  ""overall-design"": [""impressive"", ""bold"", ""subtle""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""shallow A-pillars""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""big""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""big""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""chopped"", ""lower rear seats position""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""fixed-lip""],    ""exhaust"": [""twin-turbo""]  }}```"
PORSCHE Cayenne Turbo S E-Hybrid,"Porsche wants to give the same thrill as before with its sporty cars, but in a cleaner way. This is why they launched in 2019 the new Cayenne Turbo S E-Hybrid. The performances are at the same pace, but the fuel consumption dropped. The big V8 4.0-liter gasoline engine is twin-turbo and develops 549 hp. With the help of the electric motor it reaches 680 hp and a maximum combined torque of 900 Nm (663.8 lb-ft). Transmission is via an 8-speed automatic gearbox with torque-converter. From the outside it is hard to tell the difference between a regular Cayenne and a Cayenne Turbo S E-Hybrid. The main difference is noticeable on the brake calipers, which are an electric-green color for the hybrid version and red or black for the rest of the range. Inside, the connectivity comes as standard. It allows navigation with real-time traffic information and can search for public charging station, since the vehicle is a plug-in hybrid. It includes also a wireless Apple CarPlay but Android Auto is still not available for Porsche brand. But Android users can download and install the Porsche Connect app from Google Play and have access to some features of the vehicle. There are far more commands which can be accessed via Apple CarPlay, including the heating or cooling when the vehicle is parked and locked.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Cayenne Turbo S E-Hybrid"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""clean"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""aggressive""],    ""hood"": [""bulging""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual""]  }}```"
PORSCHE Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid Coupe,"Porsche released the third generation of the Cayenne SUV at the beginning of 2023, but it waited more than six months before unleashing the sportiest version of it to that date, the Turbo E-Hybrid in the coupe-shaped bodywork and upgraded with the GT Package. When the German automaker unveiled the third generation of the Cayenne, people wondered where was the mighty Turbo version. However, the car manufacturer remained silent until late August 2023, when it unveiled it. Still, it wasn't the Turbo S customers expected, but a better version named Turbo E-Hybrid. As a result, the new product was not just more potent than the Turbo S version from the second generation but also proved to boast a lower fuel consumption and a smaller footprint than its predecessor. Porsche replaced the Turbo S with the Turbo H-Hybrid, and it did that for both body shapes: the SUV and the SUV Coupe versions. Sporting a front fascia very similar to its sibling, the Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid Coupe GT Package boasted a broad black grille flanked by tall air scoops where the automaker installed a pair of thin LED light strips for the daytime running lights system. Lower on the bumper, the automaker added a third trapezoidal air intake. From its profile, the big SUV revealed its coupe shape, with a sloped-down roof line that started above the rear seats. Furthermore, this GT Package version of the Cayenne Coupe sported black trims around wheel arches, both front and rear, that emphasized the look of the 22"" light alloy wheels. The Cayenne Coupe GT Package sat lower on the ground compared to its non-GT sibling by 10 mm (0.4"") to lower the car's center of gravity. Last but not least, the car's roof was made from carbon fiber, which also helped the car during high-speed cornering maneuvers. With a cabin fit mostly for four, yet with three seatbelts in the back, the Cayenne E-Hybrid Coupe GT Package featured sports seats for the front passengers. They faced a unique infotainment unit that stretched from the instrument cluster that fronted the driver to the side passenger. The Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid Coupe GT Package featured a pair of high-bolstered seats at the front, and Alcantara and Leather trims were also available. But the real marvel happened under the skin, where Porsche installed a drivetrain consisting of a twin-turbo V8 engine paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. In addition, an electric motor complemented the package and helped the vehicle achieve a combined power of 730 HP (739 PS). The torque went in all corners, and the SUV relied on an air suspension tuned for performance. Still, thanks to its two-chamber technology, this could also provide enough comfort for the vehicle's occupants. To stop the heavy SUV, Porsche used big brakes in all corners and offered an option for ceramic brakes (Porsche Ceramic Composite Brake – PCCB). This braking system and other improvements were standard for the Cayenne E-Hybrid Coupe with GT package.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Cayenne"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""big"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""sleek"", ""aggressive"", ""modern"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""black""],    ""hood"": [""muscular""],    ""headlights"": [""thin"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""trapezoidal""],    ""wheel"": [""22-inch"", ""light alloy""],    ""doors"": [""coupe-shaped""],    ""roof"": [""carbon fiber"", ""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""twin-turbo""]  }}```"
PORSCHE 718 Cayman GTS,"The 2019 Cayman GTS 4.0 was a mix between the GTS version and the hard-core GT4. It was a wolf in sheep clothes. It was well known by Porsche that its customers are taking their cars to the tracks to compete in friendly races. The GTS 4.0 was built to offer more performance and more grunt for those who didn't fear to go racing against more powerful cars. At the front, the Cayman GTS 4.0 featured the same apron as the GTS, with a black grille and body-colored bumper. If the car was ordered black, the whole front would have been black. On the sides, the air-intakes for the mid-mounted engine were black as well. In the back, the dual exhaust was installed, as usual for the range, in the middle of the apron. The retractable wing-mounted behind the engine lid was automatically deployed over 120 kph (74.6 mph) Inside, the sport seats were covered in Alcantara in the middle and featured the 718 badges embroiled on the headrests. For the GTS version, Porsche developed the Track Precision App, which was useful as automatically recorded, displayed, and analyzed the driving data on the smartphone. The carbon-fiber trims on the dashboard and on the door panels were accompanied by those on the center console. The flat-six engine was a 4.0-liter with direct-injection and turbocharged. It offered more power than the S-version. It was paired as standard to a 6-speed manual, and there was no option for a 7-speed automatic PDK (dual-clutch), like on the regular GTS. The ceramic brakes were on the options list, for those who were going on the tracks.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Cayman GTS 4.0"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""mid-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""aggressive"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black"", ""body-colored""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""black"", ""dual-exhaust""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""Alcantara-covered sport seats"", ""718 badges""],    ""roof"": [""retractable wing-mounted""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""retractable""],    ""exhaust"": [""dual""]  }}```"
PORSCHE Panamera 4S Diesel Sport Turismo,"Porsche surprised its fans in 2017 when it introduced the Panamera Sport Turismo at the Geneva Motor Show since the new vehicle was a shooting brake, which sported an unusual shape for this brand. The German sports car maker was mostly known for the 911 lineup that was produced for decades. But that was not enough to help the brand survive and evolve, so it had to expand its range. After the Boxster, Cayenne, and Panamera, the carmaker’s fans were in for a shock again in 2017 when Porsche unveiled a station wagon version of the Panamera. But it wasn’t styled like a regular grocery getter; it had a shooting brake shape and was powered by the same engine range as the liftback sedan Panamera, and that included a turbo diesel version that was very appreciated in Europe thanks to its fuel efficiency. Porsche didn’t start from scratch when it made the Panamera Sport Turismo. It started from the same platform used by its four-door sedan and redesigned parts of the bodywork and interior. As a result, the front fascia was similar to the one featured on the 2016 Panamera. It featured the same flush headlights that sported four LED blocks for the daytime running lights and LED headlamps. In addition, the lower bumper got a similar apron with a broad grille in the middle flanked by a pair of scoops, all crossed by two horizontal slats. The most significant difference was in the car’s profile. The automaker extended the roofline of a regular Panamera and redesigned the rear doors. Moreover, it added a third row of windows between the C-pillars and the tailgate. To create a shooting-brake image, the Sport Turismo featured blackened B- and C-posts, and the entire window line was surrounded by a chromed trim. Finally, at the back, the automaker made a raked-forward tailgate adorned by a fat roof spoiler at the top. The taillights looked like a red strip that crossed the car from side to side, wrapped around the rear quarter panels and running underneath the rear window. Underneath the bumper, the automaker installed four exhausts that flanked the diffuser. Inside, Porsche knew that it had to provide customers with a high level of elegance and comfort. At the front, it installed a pair of sports bucket seats with tall seatbacks and integrated headrests. The driver fronted a mixed instrument cluster where an analog tachometer took center stage and was flanked by two seven-inch screens designed to look like dials. But the biggest difference compared to the regular Panamera was in the back, where the automaker installed a split-folding (40/20/40) bench seat that could expand the trunk space. With the rear seats out of the way, the luggage compartment reached a whooping 1,390 liters (49 cu-ft) of space. Under the hood, the German sports car maker didn’t go for the 3.0-liter V6 turbo diesel, which it offered in the Cayenne, but it chose a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8. This powerplant developed 422 PS (416 hp) and a massive torque that was sent in all corners via an eight-speed automatic transmission. Besides performance, this version provided a range of over 1,000 km (621 miles).",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Panamera Sport Turismo"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""station wagon"",  ""overall-design"": [""elegant"", ""sporty"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""flush"", ""sloping""],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""horizontal slats""],    ""hood"": [""similar to 2016 Panamera""],    ""headlights"": [""flush"", ""four LED blocks"", ""LED"", ""sleek""],    ""bumper"": [""similar apron"", ""pair of scoops""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""redesigned rear doors""],    ""roof"": [""extended roofline"", ""blackened B- and C-posts"", ""chrome trim""],    ""diffusor"": [""flanked by four exhausts""],    ""spoiler"": [""fat roof spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": [""four exhausts""],    ""interior"": [""elegant"", ""comfortable"", ""split-folding bench seat"", ""integrated headrests""]  }}```"
PORSCHE Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid,"Porsche introduced the third generation of its biggest SUV, the Cayenne, at the beginning of 2023 but waited a little bit more to unleash the Turbo E-Hybrid version, which replaced the former Turbo S E-Hybrid. It also left a door open for a more potent version. As a reckoned sports car maker, Porsche also proved to be successful when it came to electric vehicles, such as the Taycan range. Moreover, it used the advantages of electric motors not only to lower fuel consumption but its cars' performances as well. As a result, the Turbo E-Hybrid became not just a high-performance SUV but a fuel-efficient one as well. To top it all off, the automaker prepared a unique design for the 2024 Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid that differentiated it from the rest of its siblings. The car's front featured a redesigned front bumper, which incorporated a broad grille flanked on the sides by massive air intakes. On the lower part, the automaker installed a second air intake with a trapezoidal shape that was placed in the middle of the bumper. In the lights department, Porsche chose a pair of twin horizontal LED strips housed on the upper section of the side scoops. In addition, the carmaker ditched all halogen bulbs from the headlamps and installed standard matrix-LED headlights. From its profile, the top-spec version didn't differ too much from the rest of the Cayenne range, but at the back, there was a significant difference due to the quad exhaust system that showed two pairs of rectangular pipes mounted on each side of the car, under the rear bumper. Inside the cabin, Porsche installed a minimalist-looking dashboard and steering wheel. Still, at a closer look, details such as the wide touchscreen that stretched between the instrument cluster and the side passenger. Fronting the driver was another display that showed not just the tachometer and speedometer but also various information coming from the ECU and the infotainment system. The Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid could accommodate up to five occupants. Beside the front bolstered seats, the rear flat-folding bench seat had room for three. But the real marvel happened under the skin, where Porsche installed a drivetrain consisting of a twin-turbo V8 engine paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission.

PORSCHE Macan T,"Porsche introduced the Macan T at the beginning of 2022 as a touring version for the compact-sized crossover, placing it between the standard Macan and the Macan S. Following the idea introduced on the 1968 Porsche 911, the T version is a package that combines performance-oriented amenities featured as standard and an attractive design. These elements were also introduced on the Macan T in 2022. There were some subtle changes on the outside, and they were obvious for an eye keen on details. First of all, the Agate Gray Metallic elements installed on the grille and on the sides and rear of the vehicle are unique to the Macan T-version. The sport exhausts and piano-black window trims also added more stance to the German compact-sized premium SUV. From the sides, the 20” light alloy wheels seemed to fill better the wheel-wells, especially since the car had a lower ground clearance than its siblings, the Macan and the Macan S. Inside, Porsche installed the Chrono Package as standard, which is outlined by the stopwatch placed on top of the dashboard. At the front, the eight-way electrically adjustable seats featured high bolstering to keep occupants safe during high-speed cornering. For the technical department, Porsche installed a 2.0-liter turbocharged powerplant mated to a standard seven-speed (dual-clutch) automatic transmission. The PASM is also part of the T package.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Macan T"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""premium"", ""attractive"", ""subtle"", ""stanced""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""Agate Gray Metallic""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""20” light alloy"", ""filling"", ""lower ground clearance""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""sport""]  }}```"
PORSCHE 718 Boxster GTS,"Porsche decided to give a boost to the 718 Boxster range in 2019 when it introduced the GTS 4.0 version, and the new open-top vehicle was a true competitor for its bigger and more notorious brother, the 911. When the German sports car maker launched the original Boxster back in the ‘90s, it did it to provide a more affordable but still performant sports car. That model had a 2.0-liter engine that couldn’t provide enough performance, and soon, Porsche increased the displacement to a 2.5-liter powerplant. It was close, but no cigar. Later evolutions of the model started to make customers think of the Boxster not as a cheaper 911 but as a different sportscar, and the GTS 4.0 from the 718 Boxster’s fourth generation was the kind of go-fast vehicle that customers waited for. The 2019 GTS 4.0 version looked very similar to its 2.0-liter turbocharged sibling, but there were some subtle differences between them. Just like the 2016 model, it featured a flat nose with a lower bumper that sported a broad air intake divided into three parts. The central one featured an A-shape and was flanked by side scoops that wore a single horizontal slat, unlike the lesser-powered 2.0-liter version that had three. From their profiles, these two versions were almost identical, with the main difference being that the GTS 4.0 sported a specific logo on the lower front part of the doors. The most significant difference was at the back, where the 2019 flat-six GTS had two round exhausts placed towards the car’s sides instead of a center-mounted, rectangular-shaped one. Furthermore, the smoked taillights were also a signature design for this punchier version. Inside, the automaker installed standard Sports Seats Plus wrapped in Alcantara and a unique steering wheel. In addition, Porsche upholstered the rest of the cabin with the same material: the door cards, the A-pillars, and the gearshift lever. The kickplates also sported the Boxster GTS badging. The instrument cluster featured a red-dial tachometer that took center stage and was flanked by the speedometer and an LCD for additional information from the car’s onboard computer. On the center stack, Porsche installed a 7-inch touchscreen for the infotainment system that supported Apple CarPlay only. The power-retractable roof was also standard and could quickly cover and uncover the car at speeds up to 30 mph (48 kph). When Porsche introduced the fourth generation of the Boxster, it offered it with a two-liter turbocharged unit. Later, it added other engines to the lineup, but the GTS 4.0 was the most evolved version of it. Its engine was carried over from the Porsche Cayman GT4 and was a flat-six powerplant that provided 400 PS (395), enough to rocket the car from a standstill to 62 mph (100 kph) in less than five seconds. Power went to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual or a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) PDK gearbox.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""718 Boxster GTS 4.0"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""divided""],    ""hood"": [""flat""],    ""headlights"": [""smoked""],    ""bumper"": [""lower"", ""broad"", ""sporty""],    ""wheel"": [""standard""],    ""doors"": [""profiled"", ""specific logo""],    ""roof"": [""power-retractable""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""round"", ""side-mounted""]  }}```"
PORSCHE 718 Spyder,"In 2023 Porsche unveiled the Spyder version of the 718 Cayman GT4 RS, but somehow it managed to save some weight compared to the fixed-roof version in the process. The German automaker used to have unusual open-top vehicles, such as the 911 Speedster or the 2009 Boxster Spyder. It built these sports cars to be driven under the open sky and only covered only when needed. They were not just like regular convertibles that people drove with the top up and AC on during hot summer days. So, Porsche continued the same idea when it developed the 718 Cayman Spyder RS. Porsche went the whole nine yards to create a real race car able to wear license plates. Thus, since the car no longer had a fixed roof, it had to find other solutions to create a zero-lift aerodynamic vehicle, and the engineers did it. At the front was a new spoiler that included a wider chin to increase downforce. Furthermore, the carbon fiber front fenders sported redesigned vents that extracted air from wheel wells, reducing the lift. A surprising decision was to make the windscreen's frame slimmer, at least at the top, since it was also a safety arch. On the car's sides, the automaker placed a pair of air intakes on the quarter panels. Finally, at the back, a wide duck-tail that resembled the one installed on the glorious Porsche 935 ""Moby Dick"" added more downforce to the vehicle. The interior looked very with the same race bucket seats as in the 718 Cayman GT4 RS, but available with either red or gray inserts. The roof was stored behind the cabin in a special compartment and was manual. No electronic was involved. Porsche did that to save weight. While the roof didn't provide too much protection against rain, it was more effective than an umbrella and a baseball cap. As expected, Porsche installed the same flat-six powerplant found in the 718 Cayman GT4 RS and the GT3 Cup race car. It was a 9,000 rpm, 4.0-liter engine that produced 500 PS (493 hp) sent to the rear wheels via a standard seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) PDK gearbox.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""718 Cayman Spyder RS"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""aerodynamic"", ""race-inspired"", ""open-top"", ""lightweight"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""slimmer"", ""safety-oriented""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""manual"", ""compact storage""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""wide"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""exhaust"": [""rear-mounted""]  }}```"
PORSCHE Taycan,"Porsche refreshed in 2021 its first full-electric vehicle, the Taycan, and added more range and better features to the four-door sedan. When the German sports cars maker announced the Taycan, its fans were in shock. But Porsche faced the cruel reality of climate change and the fines for CO2 emissions and had to do something. It didn’t start with the iconic 911 lineup but introduced a completely new model, the Taycan, in 2019. Come 2021, and the carmaker updated the Taycan and showed it on the small exterior changes. The entire lineup featured standard LED headlights. A pair of vertical air-intakes flanked the front bumpers as on the non-facelifted version, but they were wider. At the back, depending on the version, it sported a new bumper and diffuser. Inside, Porsche installed a partial-leather upholstery on the entire Taycan range. The carmaker pointed out that it was a man-made type and that it wouldn’t offer natural leather for the four-door sedan. A 10.9” display for the infotainment system found its place in the middle of the dashboard and offered another screen, as an option, in front of the passenger. Porsche offered the 2021 Taycan with a choice of two battery packs, which provided a range of 407 km (253 miles) and 463 km (288 miles), respectively.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Taycan"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""four-door sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""full-electric"", ""sports"", ""iconic"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""standard""],    ""bumper"": [""front"", ""wider"", ""new""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""new""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PORSCHE Panamera 4S E-Hybrid,"A new addition to the Panamera range was the 2020 4S E-Hybrid plug-in vehicle. It offered a bigger electric range than the previous Turbo S E-Hybrid. After the diesel engines started to be blamed for pretty much everything in the climate change debate, Porsche withdraws its oil-burner vehicles and replaced them with plug-in hybrids. A decision that gave some peace of mind for environmentalists but still offered enough pleasure for its customers. Porsche Panamera 4S E-Hybrid offered a special design to be distinguished from most of the rest of the range. Few new details of the vehicle enhanced the look of the “greener” Panamera. The 4-LED headlights fitted as standard were one of the key design elements that made the car attractive. As a distinctive detail, the 4S E-Hybrid featured the electric-green brake calipers and the green “hybrid” badges on the fenders and on the trunk lid. In the back, the revamped light strip ran seamlessly over the trunk lid, with an adapted contour and new LED taillights were installed. The interior of the 2020 Panamera 4S E-Hybrid featured the already known Porsche Communication Management infotainment system with a 12.3” touch-screen display mounted at the same level as the steering wheel, on top of the center stack. Along with the specific hybrid controls, it featured the improved Voice Pilot online voice control and wireless Apple CarPlay as well. Porsche didn't say anything about the Android Auto connectivity. The plug-in hybrid system was fitted with a 17.9 kWh Li-ion battery, good for an electric range of up to 54 km (33 miles). The system offered a twin-turbo V6 engine good for 440 hp and a 136 hp electric motor. The total output reached 560 hp, which was 120 hp less than the Turbo S E-Hybrid.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Panamera"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""distinctive"", ""attractive"", ""revamped"", ""enhanced"", ""improved""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""4-LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""revamped"", ""seamless""]  }}```"
PORSCHE Panamera Turbo Sport Turismo,"The introduction of the four-seat Porsche was a dream that came true with the first generation of the Panamera. In 2017, the second generation was launched in two body versions: sedan and Sport Tourismo. A Porsche couldn't bear the ""station-wagon"" name. The 2017 Panamera Sport Tourismo was more like a shooting-brake than a station-wagon. More like a lowered Macan than a station-wagon Panamera. Its raked rear looked like it was there to enhance the aerodynamic rather than increase the cargo area. Yet, that tailgate was designed for both.

PORSCHE 718 Cayman S,"The Cayman S took its “917” number from the famous Porsche 917, which won the Targa Florio race in 1959. Unlike its ancestor, the 2016 model was a sports-car for public roads. After the introduction of the Porsche Boxster, the customers asked for a closed version of that entry-level Porsche. Despite the pleasure of driving under the open sky, a closed bodywork ensured a stiffer construction and a higher cornering speed. On top of that, a coupe was lighter than a convertible. The coupe brother of the Boxster was named Cayman. The 2016 model featured a flat-four engine and rear-wheel drive. The exterior has some clues about the Porsche family, especially the front fascia with unmistakably headlights shape and flat trunk lid. No, there is no mistake, the trunk is in the front and the engine is behind the driver. On the sides, the large air-intakes in front of the rear wheels are used for engine cooling. Inside the cramped cabin, there is room for two passengers. The instrument panel features two big analog dials and one TFT display on the right side that shows various information regarding the car's parameters or the navigation system. On the center console, there is the infotainment PCM unit (Porsche Communication Management) that can be connected with smartphones via a designated Porsche App. Unlike its less-powered Cayman, the S version was fitted with a turbocharged 2.5-liter engine. Along with the direct fuel injection, the result was a 350 hp beast which could hold the maximum torque between 1.900 and 4.500 rpm. It was paired as standard with a 6-speed manual, but a 7-speed PDK (double-clutch automatic) was on the options list.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Cayman S"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""elegant"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sleek"", ""angled""],    ""grille"": [""distinctive""],    ""hood"": [""smooth"", ""contoured""],    ""headlights"": [""unmistakable"", ""sleek""],    ""bumper"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""wheel"": [""large"", ""stylish""],    ""doors"": [""compact"", ""streamlined""],    ""roof"": [""sloping"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""diffusor"": [""functional"", ""sporty""],    ""spoiler"": [""subtle"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""exhaust"": [""dual"", ""sporty""]  }}```"
PORSCHE Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid Sport Turismo,"The introduction of the four-seat Porsche was a dream that came true with the first generation of the Panamera. In 2017, the second generation was launched in two body versions: sedan and Sport Tourismo. A Porsche couldn't bear the ""station-wagon"" name. The 2017 Turbo S E-Hybrid Sport Turismo was more like a shooting-brake than a station-wagon. More like a lowered Macan than a station-wagon Panamera. Its raked rear looked like it was there to enhance the aerodynamic rather than increase the cargo area. Yet, that tailgate was designed for both. And since it didn't want to mimic the rear-end of a 911, it might be just the better solution. Inside, the Turbo S E-Hybrid Sport Tourismo looked just like the regular Panamera.

PORSCHE 718 Cayman,"Following the 911 trend, with a Touring model, the Cayman received a similar package for the T-version. It was fitted with a smaller engine, but able to deliver pleasure on long journeys. Some sports-cars are better on long journeys than others. They have to deliver a good balance between performance and fuel-efficiency. On top of that, the fun factor is a must for any Porsche. Following the tradition with T-models for the 911, the Cayman/Boxster range was offered with the same Touring line. The exterior of the Cayman T was slightly different than the regular Cayman. The body-colored vertical struts on the front apron and the black grilles were just a part of the package. Since the car was fitted as standard with the PASM (Porsche Active Suspension Management), the ground clearance was lowered by 20 mm (0.8”) than its siblings. The specific 20” light-alloy wheels were painted  in high-gloss titanium gray. Inside, the Cayman T featured door-pulls instead of handles. A discreet Cayman T logo adorned the dials and on the door entry sills. The instrument panel trims featured a glossy black finish. Included in the standard options was the Sport Chrono package as well. It offered the Normal, Sport, Sport Plus, and Individual settings via a rotary knob installed on the specific steering wheel. For the technical department, the Cayman T featured a 2.0-liter flat-four engine turbocharged that offered 300 hp. It was fitted as standard to a 6-speed gearbox while a 7-speed automatic (PDK – dual-clutch) was on the options list.

PORSCHE 911 R,"The Porsche 911 R was, probably the most impressive race-car built by Porsche, which could have been registered for road use. It was built as a tribute to the 911 R family that started in 1967. The recipe for any race-car was a lightweight construction a great engine and incredible fast-cornering abilities. All of these were combined in any Porsche GT, GTR, and R models. At the 2016 Geneva Motor Show, Porsche introduced the limited-edition R built in only 991 units. While it shared some parts with the GT3 RS version, it kept the tradition of a six-speed manual only. It was a car for purists. An apron with five openings, a special color paint in white with two red stripes, and no wing in the back. The nose resembled the GT3 but the rest of the bodywork was similar to the Carrera. It didn't have the extra-wide rear quarter panels from the Carrera 4S. They were just as wide as needed. The roof was made out of magnesium, the fenders and the hood were out of carbon fiber and the windows were from lightweight plastic. The stripped-down interior featured carbon-fiber bucket seats with some padding on them and only front seats. There was room only for the co-driver, and no other passengers. The interior door panels were made from carbon-fiber as well. An aluminum badge on the passenger's side showed the limited number of the vehicle. The audio and the air-conditioning were axed, to make the car lighter. There were almost no sound-deadening materials and all these efforts led to a 1370 kg (3020 lbs) overall weight. The engine was the naturally aspirated 4.0-liter flat-six carried over from the GT3 RS. It was mated exclusively to a 6-speed manual and a short gear-stick. But, unlike the GT3 RS, it didn't feature an interior roll-cage.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Porsche 911 R"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""lightweight"",  ""overall-design"": [""limited-edition"", ""race-car"", ""purist"", ""fast-cornering"", ""tribute""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""carbon-fiber"", ""stripped-down""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""apron"", ""five openings""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""carbon-fiber"", ""only front seats""],    ""roof"": [""magnesium""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""no wing""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PORSCHE 718 Boxster S,"The 718 Boxster S, along with its lesser brother Boxster, was unveiled 20 years after the introduction of the new roadster range from Porsche. While the first generation was received with mixed feelings, the second generation was praised. With the introduction of the 718 Boxster, the car-maker showed a special commitment to the smallest member of the Porsche family. At the front, the Boxster S featured a front fascia, with LED headlights. It featured a lower and wider grille in the apron. On the sides, the air-intakes for the mid-mounted engine were deeper and taller, to allow a better air-flow for the engine. The door-mirrors were supported by two struts. In the back, a trapezoidal exhaust was installed in the middle of the apron. A retractable wing was mounted behind the engine lid. Inside, the sport seats were covered in Alcantara in the middle and featured the 718 badges embroiled on the headrests. For the infotainment unit, the Boxster featured a PCM (Porsche Communication Management) which could have been paired to a smartphone via Apple CarPlay. There was a way to communicate with an Android device as well, but it didn't support Android Auto. The Boxster S featured a 2.5-liter flat-four engine. It was turbocharged and with direct fuel injection. On top of that, a gasoline particulate filter was added, to decrease the emissions. Due to its lightweight construction and the 350 hp engine, it could rocket from 0 to 100 kph (0-62 mph) in 4.6 seconds and could go further up to 285 kph (177 mph). The PASM (Porsche Active Suspension Management) system was available at extra cost, for those who wished to take their roadster to the race-track. It was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed automatic (PDK – dual-clutch).",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""718 Boxster S"",  ""year"": ""unveiled 20 years after the introduction of the new roadster range"",  ""size"": ""lower and wider"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""lower"", ""wider""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""mid-mounted air-intakes"", ""door-mirrors supported by two struts""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""retractable wing""],    ""exhaust"": [""trapezoidal""]  }}```"
PORSCHE Cayenne GTS Coupe,"This is how the Cayenne should've looked right from the start if the Porsche Board would have had guts! But now they fixed it and it looks great. Not too bulky not too flat, just impressive and bold. By chopping the roof by almost one inch (20mm) from a regular Cayenne, Porsche designers made the A-pillars shallower and the back seats have smaller headroom, but thanks to the lower rear seat position compared with the Cayenne by 30 mm, this will not be such a problem. The good news is that the Cayenne Coupe's trunk is big enough to accommodate almost 22 cubic feet (615 liters) and can grow up to 54.3 cubic feet (1540 liters) with the rear seats folded down. The aerodynamic package includes a combination of a fixed roof spoiler and an adaptive spoiler, both of which are increasing the model's aerodynamic efficiency at higher speeds. The adaptive spoiler can extend by 5.3 inches (135 mm). Inside, the Cayenne GTS featured the new 12.3” Full-HD touch-screen from the Porsche Communication Management infotainment system. For the instrument cluster, only the tachometer remained analog and it was flanked by two 7” displays, needed for other relevant driving data. The front sport-seats featured the GTS logo embroiled on their backseat. The Alcantara upholstery and the red stitches were part of the version's sporty appeal. For the drivetrain, the Cayenne GTS was fitted with a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8 engine. It offered 20 hp more than its predecessor, reaching 460 hp. It was paired to a standard 8-speed automatic gearbox. Due to the sport suspension, it sat 20 mm (0.8”) lower than the rest of the Cayenne S.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Cayenne"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""Not too bulky"",  ""overall-design"": [""Impressive"", ""Bold""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""Shallower A-pillars""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""Chopped roof"", ""Lower rear seat position""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""Fixed roof spoiler"", ""Adaptive spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PORSCHE Panamera Turbo S Sport Turismo,"While in the '80s the station-wagon cars were at their peaks, over time the market switched to MPVs and, later on, to SUVs. But station-wagons didn't die, they just got better. The Porsche Panamera Sport Tourismo was a good example of how a station-wagon can get better. For some, it looked even better than the regular Panamera. In terms of practicality, it featured a bigger trunk and more headroom for the rear passengers. For the 2020 model year, the facelifted version received few updates. The 2020 model Panamera Sport Tourismo Turbo S featured a different front fascia than the rest of the range, with new grilles in the apron and two pairs of light strips for the daytime running lights. It was fitted with standard LED headlights. On the sides, the 21” light-alloy wheels featured a specific design. In the back, the rectangular exhausts under the apron improved the car's look. The roof-spoiler installed on top of the tailgate featured the third brake light. Inside, there was not uncommon to see sport-bucket seats in a Porsche. What was unusual was that the Sport Tourismo had that option for the rear seats as well, or it could have been fitted with a bench for three adults. On the dashboard, it featured the already known Porsche Communication Management infotainment system with a 12.3” touch-screen display mounted at the same level as the steering wheel, on top of the center stack. The 2020 Panamera Turbo S Sport Tourismo featured the same twin-turbo V8 engine as the GTS or the Turbo version but tuned to offer 630 hp. Its performances were on par with other supercars, obtaining a 3.1 second for the 0 to 100 kph (0 to 62 mph) run, the same as the regular Panamera Turbo S.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Porsche Panamera Sport Tourismo"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""sporty"", ""practical"", ""modern"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""different"", ""new"", ""apron"", ""light strips""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""standard""],    ""bumper"": [""rectangular"", ""improved""],    ""wheel"": [""21-inch"", ""light-alloy"", ""specific design""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""spoiler"", ""third brake light""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof-mounted""],    ""exhaust"": [""rectangular""]  }}```"
PORSCHE Taycan GTS,"Introduced at the 2021 LA Auto Show, the Taycan GTS version stood between the base and Turbo versions. Porsche offered the GTS version for many of its vehicles, and the three magic letters stood for Gran Turismo Sport, meaning that those versions were built for long travels and offered both a comfortable ride and plenty of performance. Since the Taycan was an electric vehicle, its range was also crucial. Apart from the under four-second 0-100 kph (0-62 mph) acceleration time, it also provided enough juice in its batteries for over 500 km (310 miles). On the outside, the GTS featured black accents that made it unmistakable from the rest of the Tyacan range. In addition, its apron, door mirrors, and window trims featured black accents. Black side sills also adorned the lower side of the vehicle, with subtle, chromed GTS badges. At the back, the sloped rear end featured an integrated adjustable wing and the Taycan GTS nameplate underneath the third brake lights. Inside, Porsche added GTS badges on the Alcantara clad steering wheel and on the front seats' headrests. Its dashboard featured a vast dual-screen system, one for the instrument panel and the other for the infotainment. On the center stack, in an angled position, the carmaker placed another touch panel for the climate control unit. A standard adaptive air suspension ensured not only a comfortable ride but also enhanced road holding.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Taycan GTS"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""electric"", ""sleek"", ""sporty"", ""black-accented"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""Alcantara-clad"", ""GTS-badged""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""integrated"", ""adjustable""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PORSCHE Speedster,"In 2018 Porsche marked its 70th anniversary with a special model displayed at the Geneva Motor Show: the Porsche Speedster concept. One year later it launched the production model, with very few modifications compared to the prototype. Only the rear-view mirrors are different, due to regulations and safety. But the whole car is dangerous. It can steal your heart and ruin your life with its 4.0-liter naturally aspirated engine, which screams up to a stratospheric 9000 RPM. The flat-six gasoline engine is borrowed straight from the 911 GT3 version, a road version of a race car and has 510 HP and 346 lb-ft (469 Nm). The entire car is built for pure sports-car enthusiasts. You don't have pockets in the doors and no door handles inside, only some nets to hold your license and some fabric pull to open the doors. The transmission is a 6-speed manual only, shaving 9 lbs (4 kg) compared to the 7 speed manual on the Carrera and 40 lbs (18.1 kg.) compared to the PDK version. The entire car was put on a diet to save weight. The roof is made of fabric and it is manually removable, in an old school style. The AC unit is optional. After all the efforts, the Speedster weighs only 3230 lbs (1465 kg). As a result, the performance numbers are in the supercar territory: 0-60mph (97 kph) in 3.8 seconds and a top speed of 192 mph (309 kph).",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Porsche Speedster"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""dangerous"", ""sporty"", ""lightweight"", ""old-school"", ""superior""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sleek""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""compact""],    ""headlights"": [""sleek""],    ""bumper"": [""aggressive""],    ""wheel"": [""lightweight""],    ""doors"": [""pocketless"", ""handle-less""],    ""roof"": [""fabric"", ""removable""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""screaming""]  }}```"
PORSCHE 718 Boxster,"Porsche had a long history with the T-versions for its vehicles. It was used for “Touring” cars. The cars wearing that letter were stripped-out from luxury items in favor of more performance. Porsche raced and won many races, including the Tourist Trophy from Man Island and, of course, the famous Targa Florio. From then on, the T-models were chosen to be offered for those who asked for more performance and cornering speed. On the outside, the 718 Boxster T had featured 20” light-alloy wheels painted in high-gloss titanium gray. Since it was fitted with the PASM (Porsche Active Suspension Management), the ground clearance was lowered by 20 mm (0.8”) than the regular 718 Boxster. The door-mirrors were painted in gray as well. In the back, the centrally-mounted exhausts with twin tailpipes were black chrome-plated. Inside, the 718 Boxster T featured door-pulls instead of handles. The infotainment unit was removed and a big storage box took its place. It was useful for gloves. The two-way adjustments seats with black Sport-Tex center sections featured 718 logos embroiled on the headrests. The twin-turbo flat-four engine offered 300 hp. It was paired with a 6-speed manual, but a 7-speed PDK (dual-clutch) automatic was offered as an option. The rear locking differential and the PTV (Porsche Torque Vectoring) were standard as well and helped the car achieve a better cornering speed.

PORSCHE Taycan Cross Turismo,"Porsche made a bold move when it introduced the full-electric Taycan model in its range, and then, in 2021, it raised the stakes with the Cross Turismo version. Porsche had its customers and didn't see any reason to rush its electrification process. Even though its automotive engineering experience was among the highest on the market, it didn't rush. It started with hybrid versions for the Cayenne and Panamera, and then it shook the supercar world with the 918. When it came to the production model Taycan, it showed its muscles. It proved that it could build a supercar with four doors and no exhausts. Then, in 2021, it unveiled the Taycan Cross Turismo as a long-range electric vehicle. The Taycan Cross Turismo showed a similar front fascia as the four-door sibling, but the black molds on the front apron revealed its crossover intentions. On the sides, the black moldings continued on the wheel-arches and the door's sills. The extended roof and hatchback style ending resembled the Panamera Turismo style with a curved, raked-forward tailgate. Inside, it showed the same dashboard design with a dual-screen system: one for the instrument cluster and the other for the infotainment system. Porsche's designers added another touch-screen on the center stack's sloped side for the climate control functions. Its bucket seats with high bolstering showed its connection with the brand's motorsport heritage. In the back, Porsche installed a split-folding bench profiled for two but with three headrests. It could expand the trunk area up to 1200 liters (42.3 cu-ft). Unlike its Taycan sibling, the Cross Turismo version featured an adjustable suspension that allowed the driver to increase the ground clearance by 30 mm (1.2"") and introduced a gravel mode all-wheel-drive system.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Taycan Cross Turismo"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""long-range electric vehicle"",  ""overall-design"": [""bold"", ""muscular"", ""crossover"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""curved""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""sleek""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""black moldings"", ""arched""],    ""doors"": [""sloped"", ""high-bolstered""],    ""roof"": [""extended"", ""hatchback-style""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""no exhausts""]  }}```"
PORSCHE Cayenne S E-Hybrid,"In its quest to lower the CO2 emissions, Porsche introduced a Plug-in Hybrid version for the Cayenne range, a very fuel-efficient sports-SUV. Between 2002 and 2010, the Cayenne was sold in more than half-of-million units. The German car-maker pushed harder to launch new versions for the Cayenne. The SUV had something for any taste: either an economical 3.0-diesel version, a performance Turbo S and a balanced Cayenne S. But there was something more to improve: the efficiency. And that was a job for the Plug-in Hybrid version. The exterior of the 2014 Cayenne Hybrid was slightly different than the rest of the range. From the 4-LED daytime running lights and the green brake calipers to the special light-alloy wheels. The rear roof-spoiler was standard as well. Unusual though, even if the German SUV was a plug-in hybrid, it featured four round exhausts. Inside, the connection with the 911 range was more obvious due to the five-dials instrument cluster and the centrally-mounted tachometer. The new, tall and slim, air-vents were inspired by the Panamera sedan, but on the center console, the buttons from the PTM system were an updated version of those found in the first generation Cayenne. Inside the tachometer, the hybrid badge was written in the background. The engine was a 3.0-liter supercharged V6 which offered 333 hp. It was helped by a 95 hp electric motor. The 10.8 kWh battery pack offered some EV range and an electric top speed of 125 kph (78 mph). With a total output of 416 hp, the Cayenne Hybrid was able to match the Cayenne S performances to in the 0 to 100 kph (0-62 mph) sprint, but it was a bit slower on the top speed.",PORSCHE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Cayenne Hybrid"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": ""SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""fuel-efficient"", ""sporty"", ""elegant"", ""efficient"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""slightly different""],    ""headlights"": [""4-LED daytime running"", ""green brake calipers""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""special light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""rear"", ""standard"", ""spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""rear""],    ""exhaust"": [""four round""],    ""interior"": [""tall and slim air-vents"", ""five-dials instrument cluster"", ""centrally-mounted tachometer"", ""updated buttons"", ""hybrid badge""]  }}```"
PORSCHE Taycan GTS Sport Turismo,"Porsche updated the Taycan range at the 2021 LA Auto Show with the introduction of the GTS version, which stood between the regular Taycan Cross Turismo and the Taycan Cross Turismo Turbo. Over the years, Porsche offered a GTS version for most of its vehicles and the three magic letters stood for Gran Turismo Sport. These kinds of cars were built for long distances traveled in comfort, but with performance drivetrains. For the Taycan, that performance meant not only an under four-second 0-100 kph (0-62 mph) time but also an over 500 km (310 miles) of range for long travels. At the front, it was the same unmistakable front fascia as its four-door GTS sibling. The apron featured black accents, door-mirrors casings, and window trims. A panoramic roof was an option with a liquid crystal film that changed from clear to matt at the touch of a button. A roof spoiler adorned the raked-forward tailgate at the back, thus enhancing the car's aerodynamic coefficient. However, unlike the regular Cross Turismo, the GTS version didn't sport off-road accents such as the black wheel-arches flares claddings. The interior offered more headroom for the rear passengers, thanks to the extended roofline. The entire dashboard was a dual-screen system, one for the instrument panel and the infotainment. Apart from those, Porsche's designers added another touch-screen on the center stack's sloped side for the climate control functions.  In the back, Porsche installed a split-folding bench profiled for two but with three headrests. It could expand the trunk area up to 1200 liters (42.3 cu-ft).

PROTON Persona,"While the older Proton models were licensed Mitsubishi products, the 2016 Persona took a different path, and the Malaysian carmaker built a new generation on a new platform. Proton worked hard to get a vehicle designed by their engineering team. The designers might not have been as inspired as the rest of the team, but they did a good job. Worth mentioned that Proton owned the British Lotus car company, and they worked together on the powertrain and suspension. With a look that resembled some Kia models, but in a smaller package than the previous Persona generation, the 2016 model followed a new-edge design language. Its angular headlights, big grille from the lower side of the bumper, and side-scoops where the fog-lights were hosted enhanced the look of the car. The sculptured door panels, with ascending lines followed on the rear quarter panels, made the vehicle look more dynamic from the sides. But it is hard not to notice the tall, almost flat, side area. In the back, the black lower side of the bumper improved the not-so-handsome rear end. Inside, the Persona was a surprise, offering decent legroom and headroom. It was bigger inside even its predecessor, which was a larger vehicle. The dashboard looked better in the two-tone color scheme, but the dials for the standard climate controls resembled those found in a Mitsubishi Colt. For the audio system, Proton fitted a CD-stereo as standard for most trim levels. An infotainment unit with sat-nav, 4G connectivity, Android Auto, and Apple CarPlay was on the options list. Under the hood, Proton installed a 1.6-liter engine with variable valve timing. It was paired to a 5-speed manual or an optional CVT gearbox.",PROTON,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Persona"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""smaller package"",  ""overall-design"": [""angular headlights"", ""sculptured door panels"", ""ascending lines"", ""new-edge design language"", ""two-tone color scheme""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""big"", ""lower side""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angular""],    ""bumper"": [""black lower side""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PROTON Saga,"The Malaysian carmaker Proton introduced the third generation of the Saga in 2016, and it was a four-door sedan for the small segment. Proton started with know-how from Mitsubishi and built a few lineups together with the Japanese carmaker. In 1985, it introduced the first generation of the Saga, based on the Mitsubishi Lancer Fiore (Colt Sedan), and continued to work on it. The third generation of the Saga was not the big step forward expected. The design team was either replaced or under-payed to create the new lineup where the headlights seemed to be too big for the front fascia, and the trunk looked like it was added after the rest of the car was ready to roll on the assembly lines. In the rear, the design team took a similar approach as on the front side and installed big taillights that crossed from the quarter panels to the trunk-lid. Even though the third generation was introduced in 2016, the base models featured 13"" steel wheels. Only the full-option CVT Premium version received standard 15"" alloys. Inside, there was an air of cheap materials with hard plastic on the dashboard and a squared-looking instrument cluster that looked older than on older Proton vehicles. The interior design was clean, with a decent amount of space for four passengers and limited room for a third passenger on the rear bench. The one-piece fold rear seatback allowed an increase in the trunk area, but there was no split-folding option. Under the hood, Proton installed only the 1.3-liter engine and paired it as standard to a 5-speed manual gearbox. The carmaker offered a CVT transmission on the Saga's options list.",PROTON,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Saga"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""clean"", ""basic"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""basic""],    ""hood"": [""basic""],    ""headlights"": [""big""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""13-inch steel"", ""15-inch alloys""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PROTON Inspira,"Thanks to its agreement with Mitsubishi, Proton introduced the Inspira lineup in 2010 based on the same platform as the tenth generation of the Lancer, and it showed it. While it was more of a badge-engineered product, the Inspira still had specific details that made it not only look different but also unique settings that made it behave differently on the road. Moreover, the Malaysian carmaker worked on materials used inside the cabin to make it more appealing to its customers. With just a three-box bodywork available, the Inspira offered a similar image as the Lancer, but for less money. At the front, the headlights were carried over from its Japanese cousin, but the overall look was more aggressive. A satin-chromed single slat that supported the Proton badge took center stage in the grille. The base model was available with 16” light-alloy wheels, while the top trim level featured a set of 17” alloys. At the back, Proton installed a smaller lip-spoiler instead of the wing available for the Lancer. Inside, the car offered the same dashboard design as the Lancer, with a clean look and squared vents plus stereo atop the center stack. For the climate control unit, the Inspira featured three turning knobs, like the Lancer. The biggest difference was that it used different, higher-quality materials. But it kept the bucket seats at the front, with medium side bolstering. The flat rear bench was good for two adults, but the transmission tunnel was obstructing the third passenger. Customers could choose between two engines carried over from Mitsubishi: either a 1.8- or a 2.0-liter inline-four. These sent the power to the front wheels only via either a five-speed manual or a CVT for the former or a CVT-only for the latter.",PROTON,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Inspira"",  ""year"": ""2010"",  ""size"": ""three-box bodywork"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""unique"", ""appealing"", ""similar image"", ""clean look""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""satin-chromed"", ""single slat""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""front"", ""carried over"", ""aggressive""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""16” light-alloy"", ""17” alloys""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""smaller lip-spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PROTON Perdana,"The first generation of the Proton Perdana was launched in 1994 and was based on the Mitsubishi Galant Eterna. The second generation of the nameplate was launched in 2016 at Putrajaya, Malaysia. While it is based on the 8th generation of Honda Accord, its design was significantly changed and we must admit it looks really well. The window lines were redefined, fog lights were added, tail lights completely redesigned and LED-illuminated. Inside the car we can notice that the cabin is pretty much unchanged, however, the keypad was replaced by a new touchscreen. The available engines are 2.0L with 154hp and 2.4L with 178hp, both Honda iVTEC powerplants paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. For the 2.4L engine, Proton offers full leather seats, paddle shifters and navigation. The new system works on Android and is one of Proton's best implementations. It runs on Android 4.4 KitKat and is relatively lag-free. The 2.4L version has a subwoofer mounted between two rear speakers and improves the audio quality, which is already impressive. Safety wise, the vehicle is quipped with dual front and side airbags, ABS, EBD, however, the ESC  and VSA is for the 2.4L only. The cruise control is available on both variants. With all the changes, Proton did a great job in making the Perdana look like a sporty sedan.",PROTON,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Proton Perdana"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""well-designed"", ""redefined window lines"", ""redesigned tail lights"", ""LED-illuminated""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""fog lights""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PROTON Preve,"Proton tried to prove to the world that it was ready to fight on the open markets with a compact-segment sedan named Preve, which means “to prove.” Proton created its own platform, hired Italdesign Giugiaro to design the bodywork, and installed a range of engines developed together with the British carmaker Lotus. That combination should have brought more customers to the Malaysian company. A five-star crash-test rating awarded by the ANCAP was also a good starting point. Yet, the car had to face stiffer competition than the carmaker hoped for. Giugiaro designed the Malaysian sedan with ascending lines and slightly sculptured side panels. The tall back and sloped rear windscreen created an image of a mix between a hatchback and a sedan. At the front, the three-lamp headlights were adorned at the bottom by a range of crystal-like daytime running lights. Inside, Proton cut a deal with Bosch and received a multimedia system built by the German supplier. It offered an all-in-one package deal, fitted as standard for most export markets, especially for the Australian one. Due to the short wheelbase, the room in the back was not that big. Depending on the market, Proton offered the Preve with a range of three engines, and all sported the same 1.6-liter displacement. The base version offered a four-valves per cylinder technology, and the middle one provided a variable valve timing while the top-of-the-range version was turbocharged. The carmaker paired the base version with a five-speed manual, while the other options were available exclusively with a CVT transmission and no manual option.",PROTON,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Preve"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""ascending lines"", ""sculptured side panels"", ""tall back"", ""sloped rear windscreen"", ""mix between hatchback and sedan""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""three-lamp"", ""crystal-like daytime running lights""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""short wheelbase""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PROTON Ertiga,"The Malaysian carmaker Proton launched the first MPV from its lineup in 2016 as a rebadged version of the Suzuki Ertiga. Proton saw a rapid evolution of the small MPV market and decided to get a slice of that with the new vehicle from its lineup. It was the fourth new model in its range in just six months. It lasted on the market until 2018 when the Malaysian carmaker introduced the second generation of the Ertiga. The Ertiga showed clear signs of connections with the Swift due to the shape of its headlights. The designers imagined a big, tree-slats, chromed grille above the bumper. From its sides, the slightly curved door panels and the flared wheel arches disrupted the vehicle's otherwise bland look. In the back, the Ertiga featured a pair of taillights, which looked inspired by the Corolla hatchback. Inside, the B-Segment MPV from Proton featured three rows of seats. Since the middle seat from the middle row was fitted with an abdominal belt, it was not considered a proper 7-seat MPV. But the Malaysian carmaker installed that anyway since it knew that it would be used for three passengers. The front seat passengers benefited from legroom of up to 880 mm (34.6""). The middle and the last row offered up to 960 mm (37.7"") and 770 mm (30.3""), respectively. That might look good on paper, but it might not be enough if all the occupants were adults. The last row headroom was just 900 mm (35.4""). Under the hood, Proton installed only one engine version, carried over from Suzuki. It was paired as standard to a 5-speed manual transmission, while a 4-speed automatic was on the options list.",PROTON,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Proton Ertiga"",  ""year"": ""2016-2018"",  ""size"": ""B-Segment MPV"",  ""overall-design"": [""evolutionary"", ""bland"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""big"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""Swift-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""flared""],    ""doors"": [""slightly curved""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
PROTON Suprima S,"The Malaysian automaker Proton started to make its way on the car market and created the Suprima S, a hatchback aimed at young customers with a sporty design. Creating a vehicle from scratch was not a big problem for the automaker. The real problem came when it was with the car's design. They just didn't know how to make it appealing, and that's why they called Italdesign Giugiaro to give them a lending hand. The Suprima S was considered by many as a game-changer for the Malaysian brand, mainly due to its look. Its front fascia looked like it was a knight's visor, with that V-shape formed by the grille and the angular headlights. Moreover, the lower bumper split into three parts sported a center grille flanked by the side scoops that hosted the fog lamps. From its profile, the Suprima S featured an ascending beltline that emphasized the car's sportiness. At the back, Proton installed the taillights only on the quarter panels, flanking the raked-forward tailgate that offered a decent width for easier loading and unloading. Inside, Proton worked hard to deliver a much better vehicle than it used to. For that, it offered various comfort features such as power windows, buttons on the steering wheels, and a decent infotainment system. In addition, for vehicles fitted with the CVT, it even provided paddle shifters behind the steering wheel. Depending on the options, the Suprima S came with keyless-entry and start-stop button. The front bucket seats were fine for normal driving, and so was the rear split-folding bench. Under the hood, the Suprima S came fitted with only one powertrain option, a 1.6-liter turbocharged gasoline unit that was paired as standard with a CVT gearbox that provided seven-speed fixed ratios for manually changing gears.",PROTON,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Suprima S"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""angular"", ""modern"", ""dynamic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""V-shaped"", ""angular""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angular""],    ""bumper"": [""split"", ""sporty""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
QOROS 3,"Designed and engineered on the same platform as the Quoros 3 Hatch, the 3 City SUV was launched at the 2014 Guangzhou International Auto Show. In 2013, the SUV was shown as a concept-car named Qoros 3 Cross Hybrid. The production model though started with a 1.6-liter turbocharged gasoline engine. It was based on the 3 Series platform and it was the first Chinese car that obtained a 5-Star EuroNCAP score for safety. The first showrooms were opened at Bratislava, in Slovakia. From the outside, the 3 City SUV was like a compact crossover with a hatchback shape. The design team was led by Gert Hildebrand, former head of external design for Volkswagen, SEAT and General Manager of MINI design, leading the MINI Clubman, Countryman and Coupe models. In 2011, Hildebrand joined the new Chinese Israeli joint venture Chery Quantum Automotive Corporation, now called Qoros, as Head of Design. Inside, the Volkswagen influences were noticeable on the instrument cluster and the dashboard. Even the rotary knob for the lights had a similar design and was placed in the same position as in a Volkswagen. The infotainment unit featured an 8” touch-screen display and it was based on the Microsoft Windows Azure platform. It had an 800 x 480 screen resolution. For the drivetrain, the Qoros 3 SUV featured a 1.6-liter turbocharged gasoline engine mated to a standard 6-speed manual transmission. A 6-speed dual-clutch transmission was available as an option.",QOROS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Qoros 3 City SUV"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": ""compact crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""hatchback shape"", ""Volkswagen influences"", ""compact""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
QOROS 5,"Qoros launched the model 5 in October 2015, ahead of the Guangzhou Auto Show, and the carmaker stated that it will focus on the Chinese market before trying to reach other countries. The Chinese-Israeli joint-venture introduced the Qoros 5 aimed at the compact crossover segment, playing in the same league as the Kia Sportage and other similar vehicles. Still, the young automaker was reluctant to expand to other countries since it wasn't very sure about its export capabilities. So, later on, Qoros opened its sales departments in Russia and Europe. With lines that resembled other vehicles, such as the Range Rover Evoque at the front, and the Kia Sportage at the back, the 5 was not exactly an all-original design. In addition, the grille looked similar to some European vehicles, such as Peugeot, but instead of the Lion badge in the middle, it sported a Q-sign on the upper side. But, all in all, the proportions were right, and the flared wheel arches gave the vehicle an off-road stance, even though it was more of a curb-carver than a trail-ready car. Inside, the design was more original, with an upper area that included the center air vents and elegant satin-metallic trim. On the center stack, the carmaker installed the infotainment system. The 5 offered room for five adults, with front bucket seats and a bench for three in the back. Yet, the floor's shape didn't leave much room for the middle-seated passenger. Under the hood, Qoros added a turbocharged mill that produced a healthy 160 horsepower paired with a six-speed automatic.",QOROS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Qoros 5"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""compact"", ""off-road stance"", ""elegant"", ""original"", ""proportional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""European"", ""Q-sign""],    ""hood"": [""flared""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""flared""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""turbocharged""]  }}```"
RAM Trucks 1500,"RAM Trucks didn't rush to launch its first fully electric pickup, but it came packed with technology and features never seen on other vehicles in its class. Stellantis knew that pickup lovers were not very fond of electric cars, so it tried to convince them with one that could outperform any other truck in its class. Moreover, it offered them not just a utility vehicle but one that could provide on and off-road performance, comfort, a touch of luxury, and huge versatility. RAM vehicles looked mean, and the automaker wanted to keep that, and it did. At the front, it placed an illuminated badge that took center stage on the grille. It was flanked by arrow-shaped LED lights and headlights. The 1500 REV front fenders were flared to allow 275/50R22 wheels. Finally, at the back, the car featured as an option a powered tailgate (up and down) adorned by an illuminated red RAM badge. Inside, depending on the trim level and options, the 1500 REV featured a 12.3"" digital instrument cluster, a 14.5-inch touchscreen for the Uconnect 5 infotainment unit, and a 10.25-inch display on the passenger side. In addition, customers could choose a head-up display. But Stellantis also knew that customers used pickups also as recreational vehicles, besides their utilitarian destination, and provided them with V2L capabilities. In the frunk, the vehicle featured a 3.6 kW outlet, while at the back, it was fitted with a 7.2 kW plug to power tools, refrigerators, homes, or charge other BEVs. The new STLA platform featured a frame specifically designed for body-on-frame vehicles and provided a two-motor system. These, combined, provided up to 654 hp (481 kW) for both axles. RAM offered an option for two battery packs: a standard 168 kWh and a 229 kWh large battery pack. The former ensured a range of 350 miles (563 km), while the latter reached an astonishing 500 miles (805 km) for the 800 volts architecture pickup.",RAM Trucks,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""RAM 1500 REV"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""full-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""mean"", ""luxurious"", ""versatile"", ""powerful"", ""electric""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""illuminated"", ""center-stage""],    ""hood"": [""flared""],    ""headlights"": [""arrow-shaped"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""275/50R22""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""powered"", ""illuminated""]  }}```"
RAM Trucks 2500,"RAM refreshed the 2500 lineup for the 2016 model year and brought several improvements in all the areas. In the regular cab shape, the well-known pickup provided what was necessary for a hard-working truck. While most private customers looked for the bigger versions of the vehicle, the companies that needed a simple, no-nonsense workhorse ticked the Regular Cab version. They did that not only because it was the most affordable but also came with a longer bed. The car's exterior varied depending on the trim level. While the base models sported black bumpers and were offered only in white, the other versions were provided with various colors and chromed bumpers. Moreover, the base model featured steel wheels. Still, the carmaker provided an option for a few alloy wheels for the upper trim levels. RAM knew that most work trucks were used for daily dirty jobs, and that's why it provided the vehicle with either fabric or vinyl upholstery. The latter was offered on the Tradesman version along with a set of cranked windows. Moreover, the plastic on the dashboard was sturdy and designed to be wiped clean with a piece of cloth. But if the customers asked for more, the carmaker provided higher quality trims and an 8.4"" Uconnect infotainment unit with reversing camera. Under the hood, the Regular Cab received a wide engine choice starting with a 5.6-liter V-8 and going up to a 6.4-liter Hemi. The diesel versions sported towing hooks at the front, and Cummins provided the 6.7-liter inline-six engines.

RAM Trucks 3500,"In 2009, Dodge Ram was converted into Ram Trucks as a separate brand for light utility vehicles, and the third generation of the 3500 series became Ram Trucks 3500. In 2014, Chrysler's light commercial vehicle division, born from the Dodge brand, introduced a facelifted version for the 3500 HD series. It was available in a few cab-styles, including a chassis-cab or as a regular-cab version with a bed in the back and ready to receive a gooseneck. It was the hard-worker of the family, used to carry heavy loads and pull trailers with construction vehicles. Its exterior look was improved with the introduction of a new pair of headlights and, depending on the trim level, black plastic bumpers. For the better-equipped versions, Ram Trucks offered body-colored bumpers or even chromed metallic ones. The carmaker kept the cross-hair grille design from the rest of the Dodge brand. In the rear, the wide quarter panels were required to fit the dual-wheels system. Inside, Ram Trucks offered a simple cloth upholstery for the base version. It was fit for regular workers. For those who used the 3500 Regular-cab as a pulling vehicle for a luxurious trailer, the carmaker offered better features such as a 7"" infotainment screen on the center stack. But the powertrain was the most important part of the vehicle. Ram Trucks offered the 3500 Regular cab with a choice of three engines. The gasoline Hemi engines were carried over from the rest of the Ram truck range, while the 6.7-liter Cummins turbodiesel engine was an industrial grade.

RENAULT Espace,"The Espace reached its sixth generation in the Spring of 2023, and Renault placed its bets on a daring evolution by transforming the beloved European MPV into a crossover-style people carrier. Sharing its CMF-CD platform with the Austral crossover, the new Espace went to the next level and adopted an SUV stance, leaving behind the minivan shape that made it so special on the European market. But the French automaker took all the right steps to create a vehicle that could successfully replace the successful MPV. While the previous generations of the Espace sported an MPV-like bodywork, the sixth generation was different. It featured a distinct engine compartment and a steeper windshield. The car's front fascia showed the specific, C-shaped, LED daytime running lights that surrounded the outer sides of the headlights. A massive grille with eighteen vertical slats and the broad Renault badge in the middle created a potent image for the vehicle. On the lower side of the bumper, the automaker added a secondary grille flanked by a pair of scoops. The profile revealed a set of enlarged rear fenders that made the SUV look muscular. Inside, Renault offered the option for five or seven seats, the latter being in a 2-3-2 configuration. The automaker installed a pair of screens on the dashboard. The one fronting the driver was a landscape-mounted, 12.3"" TFT display, while the one atop the center stack was a 12"" touchscreen mounted vertically. In addition, the automaker offered an option for a 9.3"" head-up display. Among other attractive features of the CMF-CD modular platform was the all-wheel steering system, named 4CONTROL, which helped the car get a tighter turning radius. In addition, it improved handling at higher speeds.",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Espace"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""crossover-style people carrier"",  ""overall-design"": [""daring evolution"", ""SUV stance"", ""distinct engine compartment"", ""muscular profile"", ""attractive features""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""steeper""],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""eighteen vertical slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""C-shaped LED daytime running lights""],    ""bumper"": [""secondary grille"", ""pair of scoops""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""option for five or seven seats""],    ""roof"": [""option for 2-3-2 configuration""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""all-wheel steering system""]  }}```"
RENAULT Arkana,"Renault introduced the Arkana lineup on the market in 2019, offering an affordable SUV coupe for those who couldn't or wouldn't pay the high sticker price of a BMW X4 or a Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupe. Sales went through the roof, and despite the 2020 pandemic situation, it exceeded 240,000 units by 2023 when the French automaker launched the upgraded version of the vehicle. Since the automaker promoted the vehicle as a sporty alternative to a hatchback, it added some muscular looks to the vehicle. At the front, the 2024 Arkana featured a new bumper fitted with a large, trapezoidal grille flanked on the sides by a pair of scoops that channeled air onto the front discs. The radar for the adaptive cruise control and the advanced safety systems was placed in the middle, and Renault added a lip spoiler underneath it. On the upper grille, the automaker installed the redesigned company's logo, connected with the headlights via a shiny black line. From its profile, the sporty-looking SUV coupe featured fake exhaust vents on the front fenders, and the side sills were emphasized by dark tones. Furthermore, the automaker adorned the wheel arches with black plastic moldings, which created the impression of larger wheels. On the rear fascia, Renault added a new bumper decorated with fake exhausts mounted under the underbody plastic shield that mimicked aluminum. Inside, Renault added new materials made from recycled elements. On the dashboard and seats, it introduced the Eco-tep and imitation suede, while the door cards boasted red, white, and blue stitching, resembling France's national flag. Between the bolstered front seats, the center console housed the e-gear lever that was completely electrical, without any cables between it and the gearbox. On the dashboard, the carmaker kept the same digital instrument cluster, and the touchscreen display for the infotainment system was placed atop the center stack. In the back, the automaker installed a split-folding bench for three that could expand the trunk area. Even though the headroom was nothing to write home about it, it was suitable for children and average-sized adults. The automaker built the Arkana on the CMF-B platform and installed gasoline and hybrid powertrains. But despite the crossover look, all versions sent their power to the front wheels only. Furthermore, unlike other SUV-coupe vehicles on the market, the Arkana featured semi-independent rear suspension since it was a more affordable technical solution. For the 2024 Arkana, Renault offered a choice of engines ranging between 140 PS (138 HP) and 160 PS (158 HP). The carmaker also installed a hybrid version that provided a total output of 145 PS (143 HP) from a 94 PS (93 HP) internal combustion engine, helped by a 36 kW (48 HP) electric motor.",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Arkana"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""SUV coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""muscular"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""stylish""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""large"", ""trapezoidal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""connected"", ""shiny black""],    ""bumper"": [""new"", ""decorated"", ""lip spoiler""],    ""wheel"": [""emphasized"", ""black plastic moldings""],    ""doors"": [""recycled materials"", ""imitation suede"", ""colorful stitching""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""lip""],    ""exhaust"": [""fake vents"", ""fake exhausts""]  }}```"
RENAULT Clio 5 Doors,"Renault unveiled the facelifted version of the fifth generation of the Clio in the Spring of 2023, and it was a revolution for this lineup in terms of design and engineering. After more than 16 million units sold, the Clio was Renault's best-selling model. It deserves to be kept updated with new technologies. Unfortunately for the French automaker, when it introduced the fifth generation at the Geneva Motor Show in 2019, it wasn't ready to implement hybrid drivetrains, and, at that time, the LED lighting was not what customers targeting supermini models were looking for. But in just four years, many things changed, including buyers' expectations. The most significant change was on the car's front fascia, which featured a broad upper grille complemented on the apron by a similarly sized second grille. On the sides, on the lower bumper, Renault installed a pair of slatted scoops, which were mostly for look. For the headlights, the automaker adopted LED technology for all trim levels, thus enhancing the car's look. Moreover, a new trim level was added to the lineup: the Spirit Alpine that replaced the former RS. Along with that, it brought 17"" light-alloy wheels. Inside, there was a redesigned instrument cluster that was filled with a 7"" or a 10"" TFT display instead of analog dials and gauges, depending on the trim level. In addition, atop the center stack, Renault offered an option for either a 7"" or a 9.3"" touchscreen for the infotainment system that provides wireless screen mirroring with smartphones. Like the non-facelifted version, the 2023 Clio had internal combustion engines fueled by gasoline, diesel, or LPG. In addition, a hybrid drivetrain became available.",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Clio"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""supermini"",  ""overall-design"": [""revolutionary"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""upper"", ""second"", ""complemented""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""enhancing""],    ""bumper"": [""lower"", ""slatted""],    ""wheel"": [""17-inch"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""hybrid""]  }}```"
RENAULT Megane Sedan,"Designed as a four-door coupe, but with a reasonable price, the Renault Megane sedan received a facelift in 2020 to prepare it for the 2021 pollution norms. The French carmaker introduced the Megane sedan in 2016, and it sold it in more than 200.000 units since then. It was part of the Megane lineup, which also comprised the 3-door, the 5-door, and the station wagon. Starting with January 2021, all new cars registered in the EU had to comply with the Euro 6d regulations. Since they had to work on the engines and four years already passed since the car was introduced to the market, Renault decided to work on a facelifted version. For the 2020 model, the LED technology was integrated into the car's headlights along with the light-strip for the DRL. The front bumper was reshaped as well, and it featured a more aggressive style with fake side-scoops in the apron and a lower grille with four slats. Another change was the addition of two chromed, fake exhausts under the rear bumper. Inside, the driver was welcomed by a completely new 10.2"" digital instrument panel, which integrated the navigation system along with the other dials needed for regular driving. Next to it, Renault installed a 9.3"" multimedia on the center stack system named Easy Link. Renault offered the Megane Sedan with a 1.0-liter turbocharged gasoline engine as a base model for the drivetrain, which offered 115 hp. The top of the line 1.3-liter four-pot provided 140 hp. For the diesel fans, the French carmaker installed a 1.5-liter dCi powerplant that offered 115 hp. All three engines were paired as standard to a 6-speed manual, while the last two could have been mated to a 7-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox.",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Renault Megane Sedan"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""four-door"",  ""overall-design"": [""reasonable price"", ""facelifted"", ""LED technology"", ""digital instrument panel"", ""aggressive style""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""lower grille"", ""four slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""light-strip"", ""reshaped""],    ""bumper"": [""reshaped"", ""more aggressive style"", ""fake side-scoops"", ""lower grille"", ""four slats"", ""chromed"", ""fake exhausts""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""four-door""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""chromed"", ""fake exhausts""]  }}```"
RENAULT Megane Estate,"The french manufacturer broke the silence in the beginning of 2020 with the introduction of the new, face-lifted generation of its top-seller in the compact range, the Megane. The biggest improvements are on the tech-department, which are added to a slightly modified bodywork. On the outside, the new Megane was improved with a new pair of headlights, which received LED technology for better visibility. The plug-in estate version has a 434 liter trunk-space (15.3 cu-ft), 84-liters (3 cu-ft) less than the non-hybrid versions. Renault was at the forefront of electric mobility in Europe. The French carmaker hase a line-up of electric vehicles ranging from the two-seater Twizy up to the light commercial vehicles. Now it made a bold move into the plug-in hybrid (PHEV) technology, two years after buying Mitsubishi Motors, who already had this technology in production. The Renault Megane E-TECH plug-in hybrid can run 65 km (40 miles) purely electric in the mixed cycle or 50 km (31 miles) in urban environment (according to the WLTP cycle). The face-lifted Megane will lose the GT-Line trim, which has been replaced with the new RS-Line badge.

RENAULT Kangoo,"Nicely blending everyday practicality with reduced ownership costs, the Renault Kangoo was one of the best-selling and in Europe. With the first model launched in 1997, the 2020 Kangoo was the third generation, however, it was based on the Kangoo version launched in 2008. Available as a standard-length van or a long-wheelbase van, the latter was equipped with an optional second row of seats. A special model was also offered, a more rugged Kangoo that was good for a bit of mud with a mechanical slip differential, underbody protection and a higher ground clearance. The regular Kangoo was available in two trim levels, the Business and the Business +. For 2020, the Kango was available with a choice of three different engines and even an all-electric motor that developed 60 hp. The van drove well, with a light and responsive steering, however, the ride was rougher than the ones offered by other models on the market. The cabin offered a decent amount of room, the controls were smartly and intuitively placed, however, it was rather a dull cabin, at least without the 7-inch touchscreen that was available with the R-Link multumedia system. While the base model offered a DAB radio, electric windows and a height-adjustable steering wheel, the Business + trim level added air-conditioning, rear-parking sensors, electric folding mirrors, 15-inch alloys and body colored bumpers.",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Renault Kangoo"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""standard-length van, long-wheelbase van"",  ""overall-design"": [""practical"", ""rugged"", ""smart"", ""intuitive"", ""responsive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""body-colored""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
RENAULT Megane 5 Doors,"The benefits of E-Tech Plug-in, inspired by Renault Formula 1 expertise, combines the obvious advantages of an electric drive (such as low noise, immediate responsiveness and reduced fuel consumption) with energy recover technology and an ICE engine. With its 9.8 kWh battery, the sleeker Renault Megane has a range of 50 kilometers in mixed cycle and up to 65 kilometers over an urban cycle, without using the combustion engine, thus proving its versatility in the long weekend journeys or for holidays. he E-Tech Plug-in technology was developed by Renault Engineering and it pairs the said battery with a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder petrol engine (160 hp) and two electric motors offering a unique driving experience. In this hardware configuration, the Megane E-Tech can be driven on 100 % electric power at speeds up to 135 km/h. Even though the car has similar design and dynamic with its predecessors, the New Renault Megane has become slicker than ever before. Like the entire range, it comes with an integrated 9.3-inch screen and the Renault Easy Link multimedia system, as well as the new 10.2-inch TFT digital speedometer.

RENAULT Captur,"This is the best selling model in the c-SUV segment in Europe. It pioneered this segment and now it owns it. Actually, it is so well sold that it will be manufactured in China, where Renault has a very important market. When it was launched back in 2013, it didn't have too many engines and variants. It was based on the B platform from the fourth generation of the Clio. The 2020 model is based on the fifth generation of the Clio platform, the same used for Nissan Juke. On the outside, there are new headlights, in the same style with the compact class Megane and the Clio. A bigger interior was possible due to the CMF-B platform, which is modular and can be extended. For the engines, Renault announced that a plug-in version will be made. Thus, this will be the first car in its segment with a plug-in hybrid version. The other engine choices are either gasoline or diesel. Their power will range between 100 and 155 hp. No all-wheel-drive version was announced. Inside, there is a new interior with more focus on infotainment and passenger comfort. In front of the driver, in the instrument cluster, there is a TFT screen that can show turn-to-turn navigation and various other information for the driver.

RENAULT Koleos,"Just two years after launching the second generation of the Koleos, Renault gave it a facelift to boost sales, but the result was below expectations. The Koleos was a mid-size crossover with a French attitude based on the same platform as the Nissan X-Trail (or the Rogue in the U.S.) and the Samsung QM6. Unfortunately for Renault, customers didn't recognize the French automaker as a trustworthy 4x4 manufacturer, so it didn't succeed with it. It struggled to get a six-figure annual sales but it couldn't. Moreover, in Europe, it managed to get a five-figure number just for three years. The refreshed version was quite a looker. Its front fascia sported big LED headlights from the mid-trim level and daytime running lights that were extended from the headlamps to the bumper. In addition, several chromed details on the grille and the fog lamps' scoops adorned the vehicle. Moving on the profile, the automaker added more shiny ornaments to the doors' surroundings, door handles, and front fenders. Still, the carmaker's design team made it bold but not too flashy. Inside, customers found bolstered front seats separated by a tall center console. Moving on to the dashboard, the automaker integrated the infotainment system into the center stack but kept some of the physical buttons. Renault installed a mixed panel inside the instrument cluster with a center-mounted digital tachometer flanked by the fuel level and the water temperature gauges. At the back, the split-folding bench-seat was wide enough to accommodate three adults, and the center tunnel was not too tall. Renault offered the Koleos with either a front or an all-wheel drive system and installed gasoline or turbo-diesel engines underneath its mid-sized SUV's hood, depending on the market.",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Koleos"",  ""year"": ""refreshed version"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""French attitude"", ""bold but not too flashy""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""chromed details""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""big LED headlights"", ""daytime running lights""],    ""bumper"": [""extended daytime running lights""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""shiny ornaments""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
RENAULT ZOE,"The French manufacturer put itself in pole-position for the ecology race, adding a new generation for its sub-compact electric vehicle, the Renault Zoe. On the outside, the Zoe has received a redesigned hood, new bumper and, most importantly, LED headlights as standard. Even though Renault didn't invest too much money in the exterior design for the new Zoe, things inside are different. In front of the driver, there is a 10” TFT display that replaces the classic analog dials. Due to the new screen, the driver receives constant indications to improve his or her driving skills for ecology. On the center console, there is the EASY LINK Renault infotainment system, which supports Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. There are new interior material improvements, which are softer and nicer to touch. On the Iconic trim level, the seats are made out of 100% recycled materials. Other improvements are noticed in the space between the driver and the passenger. On the prolonged center console, there is the gear selector, used for different driving modes, including the B-mode, which allows one-pedal driving due to a boosted energy recovery system. Last, but not least, the Zoe has received an electronic park brake, which replaces the classical lever.

On the outside, the new headlights are remarkable. The full range of the Talisman comes with full LED lights. Optionally, it can be equipped with LED MATRIX technology and dynamic LED turning signals. The new system allows good visibility on the road, lightning up to 220 m away, versus 175 m on the previous LED system. Also, there are new 17”, 18” and 19” alloy-wheels available. Inside the cabin, the Talisman Estate offers a trunk of 573 liters (20.73 cu. ft), with the rear seats up and can be extended up to 1700 liters (60 cu. ft) with the rear seats folded.

RENAULT Kadjar,"The awaited mid-life cycle refresh for the compact SUV Renault Kadjar arrived in 2019. Underneath the fluid lines of the bodywork was the same platform CMF shared with the Nissan Qashqai, but somehow different. Their technical alliance allowed some swaps for engines and transmissions. It offered an alternative for the Japanese cousin, with a different approach. Outside, the big chromed Renault Logo stood proud on the grille and the headlights. The C-signature for the DRL. The headlights and taillights gained LEDs instead of halogen lamps, but not for all the trims. Some of them were still kept in the halogen era to offer cheaper versions. Inside, the instrument cluster is full TFT, with elements taken from the Megane. A trained eye could notice some other buttons and switches from the compact Renault. A good gain is the R-Link 2 infotainment system that can cope with the Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Since more than 70% of the European SUV market was for the 2WD transmission system, only a few versions of the Kadjar were offered with a 4WD system. There was a wide range of engines and transmissions, with a 6-speed manual offered as standard. CVT and 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmissions were available as an option.

RENAULT Scenic,"Renault reinvented one of the most successful models in its history, the Scenic, and added an electric drivetrain to make it more appealing to those customers looking for a sustainable vehicle. When the French automaker introduced the Scenic lineup in 1996 as a member of the Megane family, customers were happy about it. It was a minivan built on top of a compact-sized car that could provide more interior room than any station wagon on the market. Starting with the model's second generation, the Scenic became a distinct model in Renault's lineup and lost the Megane moniker. As the times changed and people became more and more attracted to electric vehicles, Renault decided to transform this model into an EV. Moreover, it completely overhauled the entire concept, and the former MPV morphed into a crossover. In 2023, Renault introduced the fifth generation of the Scenic, and customers were pleased since it wasn't a minivan anymore. The new crossover-shaped vehicle showed a distinct front fascia with LED headlights, and instead of a grille, was a hexagonal pattern that mimicked the carmaker's logo. Still, the vehicle needed some cooling area for the batteries and the electric motors. As a result, Renault placed a grille in the air dam on the lower part of the bumper. In addition, the Scenic E-Tech featured a pair of fake side scoops. They had no use other than making the car look good. To emphasize the transition to this segment, Renault created tall and sculptured door panels that integrated the side sills at the bottom. Finally, at the back, the hatchback shape resembled the now defunct Megane wagon, and the rear fascia got the taillights extended from the quarter panels to the tailgate. Furthermore, the lower bumper was unpainted, with a design inspired by off-road vehicles. The interior was a big step forward in terms of quality and technology. Since Renault promised to make the car sustainable, it used its imagination and created a new upholstery made from recycled materials. At the front, the automaker installed a pair of high-mounted seats divided by a tall center console with an armrest and a storage compartment. Fronting the driver was a 12.3"" instrument panel complemented by a portrait-mode touchscreen placed atop the center stack. The R-Link infotainment system ran on Android Automotive OS12. In the back, the automaker installed a bench seat fit for three adults. Another significant upgrade in terms of technology was the panoramic roof. While it couldn't be opened, the driver could control it and make it more or less opaque at the touch of a button. But the most significant change happened under the Scenic's skin. Renault built the Scenic E-Tech on the CMF-EV platform and installed a choice of two battery packs for it. In addition, there were two powertrains available. The base version offered a 125 kW (168 HP) motor, while the second was more powerful and delivered 160 kW (215 HP) to the front wheels. The former version also featured a smaller battery pack than the latter.",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Scenic"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""electric"", ""crossover"", ""sculptured"", ""sustainable"", ""panoramic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""tall""],    ""grille"": [""hexagonal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""lower"", ""unpainted"", ""off-road-inspired""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured"", ""tall""],    ""roof"": [""panoramic""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
RENAULT Grand Scenic,"Renault took a gamble when it launched the first Renault Espace back in the '80s, but gain more when it expanded its MPV range, like the Renault Scenic and Grand Scenic. In 2016, Renault launched a new generation for the Scenic and, also, a longer version for the Scenic range and named it Grand Scenic. It was an MPV that offered up to seven seats plus some trunk space. But if it was fitted with only 5 seats, the trunk volume was 718 liters (25.3 cu-ft). The extra 24 cm (9.4"") wheelbase was needed to offer a roomier interior and more comfort for the rear passengers, even though most of the time those are placed safely in child seats. The Grand Scenic could have been equipped with a large panoramic glass roof with no cross-member for better light. Renault had a bold move in the segment, offering 20"" light-alloy wheels fitted as standard. In the middle of the dashboard, going down on the center console, Renault offered an 8.7"" tablet for the R-Link infotainment system. The exterior had a dynamic look, with a V-shaped grille and angled headlights. It resembled the Captur range more than the Megane. But it sat on the new CMF-CD platform, used by the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance for various vehicles, including the Nissan Rogue and the Nissan Qashqai. The Renault Grand Scenic was offered with 6 diesel engines and two gasoline units. It was available with a 6-speed manual or 7-speed automatic (dual-clutch).",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Renault Grand Scenic"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""MPV"",  ""overall-design"": [""dynamic"", ""roomy"", ""bold"", ""panoramic"", ""light-alloy""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""V-shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angled""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""20-inch""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""panoramic"", ""no cross-member""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
RENAULT Megane Cabriolet,"Renault unveiled the facelifted, open-top version of the Megane range in 2013 and started to sell it in 2014, promising an enjoyable experience by adding a new front fascia and more technology inside. With the new Euro6 emission standards coming, the French carmaker had to make its move in the compact segment and introduced the refreshed Megane range. But it wasn't only the hatchback or the station wagon that went through this process. Even though the convertible market was not such significant, the carmaker kept its promise and brought the rejuvenated version of this model as well. The new front fascia dropped the boomerang-style headlights from the Megane range, which lasted from 2010. Moreover, the front fascia sported a slimmer grille and a larger badge that took center stage. To help cool the engine, the carmaker added a wider grill in the lower bumper, flanked by the foglights' clusters. On the sides, there were little changes from the windshield to the back, but it installed tinted taillights. Also, the rear bumper was changed, adding a splitter in the lower center section. Inside, like its predecessor, the Megane Coupe-Cabriolet offered room for four on a pair of bucket seats at the front and a bench in the rear. But unfortunately, there was hardly any legroom left for those seated in the back due to the retractable hard-top compartment. On the other hand, the driver was spoiled with an optional navigation system that could have been ordered and installed in the middle of the dashboard. Under the hood, Renault chose to install a turbocharged 1.2-liter powerplant. The downsizing trend forced the French carmaker to do that, but it also offered a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated unit. Moreover, there was also a choice of turbo-diesel engines.",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Megane Coupe-Cabriolet"",  ""year"": ""2013"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""facelifted"", ""open-top"", ""refreshed"", ""rejuvenated"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""slimmer""],    ""grille"": [""larger"", ""centered""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""boomerang-style"", ""dropped""],    ""bumper"": [""wider"", ""lower"", ""changed""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""retractable""],    ""roof"": [""hard-top""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""turbocharged"", ""naturally aspirated""]  }}```"
RENAULT Austral,"Renault introduced a new compact-segment SUV on the European market in 2022, thus replacing the Kadjar, which lasted only for one generation. When a carmaker gets a successful model, it keeps its nameplate. The Suburban is one of the most obvious examples in the industry. On the other hand, Renault tried the SUV segment with the Koleos, built together with Samsung, then it tried its luck with the Kadjar and, starting with 2022, with the Austral. The vehicle was the first to be made on the CMF-CD3 platform developed together with Nissan. Its external dimension of just 4.51 m long (177.5 in) placed it in the European compact-sized segment. At the front, the car sported Renault's signature design with C-shaped headlights and a massive, diamond-patterned grille that sported the large carmaker badge. In addition, the waved lines on the bodywork and the blackened C-pillar and tinted third side window created the sensation of a shooting brake on stilts. The new micro-LED taillights also sported the same C-shape as the headlights at the back. Inside, the Austral boasted with its digital dashboard. The center stack has a 12.3"" instrument cluster and a portrait-type 12"" multimedia screen. Moreover, a 9.3"" head-up display added more comfort for the driver. For the rear passengers, the Austral offered an impressive room for up to three persons, with more knee room than most of its competitors. The trunk provided 500 liters (17.6 cu-ft) of space. Thanks to the sliding bench that could have been expanded to 575 liters (20.3 cu-ft). By folding the rear seats' seatback, the trunk could reach 1,525 liters (53.8 cu-ft). Under the hood, Renault installed a wide engine range, either hybrid or mild hybrid. Depending on the trim level and the engine choice, the Austral was available with either a six-speed manual or a CVT.",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Austral"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""C-shaped headlights"", ""diamond-patterned grille"", ""waved bodywork lines"", ""micro-LED taillights"", ""digital dashboard""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""diamond-patterned""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""C-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""blackened C-pillar"", ""tinted third side window""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
RENAULT Megane E-Tech,"Renault made another step towards electric mobility by introducing the Megane e-Tech in 2021, after more than a decade since the launch of its first mass-produced electric vehicle, the Zoe. Switching to electric mobility was not a big issue for the French manufacturer since it had the Japanese brands Nissan and Mitsubishi as partners, both very experienced in the EV segment. The Megane e-Tech was a major step for Renault since it was its first car built on the new CMF-EV platform. Thanks to the shorter engine compartment and fewer transmission parts, the Megane e-Tech received a 2.7 m (106.3”) wheelbase. It had the wheels pushed out in the car’s corners. The crossover stance was amplified by the tall door panels and short greenhouse. Its rear quarter panels featured a raised area on their upper side, forming a pair of shoulders for the car. Shod with a set of 20” light-alloy wheels, the Megane e-Tech looked ready for the next generation of vehicles. Inside, the French designers created a squared, broad panel curved towards the driver seat. It offered a digital instrument panel in front of the steering wheel and a tall, portrait mode display atop the center stack. A few physical buttons still emerged at the bottom of that touch-screen. Thanks to the lack of a transmission tunnel, the carmaker managed to create a flat floor. Also, under the passengers’ feet, the CMF-EV platform featured a thin, 110 mm (4.33”) battery pack. The Megane was available with a choice of two battery packs of 40 kWh and 60 kWh.",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Megane e-Tech"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""2.7 m (106.3”) wheelbase"",  ""overall-design"": [""crossover stance"", ""squared, broad panel"", ""ready for next generation""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""short"", ""curved""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""20” light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [""tall door panels""],    ""roof"": [""short greenhouse""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
RENAULT Grand Kangoo,"Renault refreshed the Kangoo lineup in 2023 and added the long wheelbase version for it, named Grand Kangoo. In addition, the French automaker offered electric versions of this successful utility vehicle, which was also available as a people carrier. The Kangoo was one of the most successful light commercial vehicles on the European market. Renault launched this model in 1997 and, along the model's three generations, it constantly improved it and gave it more aptitudes and capabilities. While it didn't look like a regular MPV, it proved to be better than most minivans in that size segment in terms of interior room, comfort, and fuel efficiency. When Renault launched the third generation of the Kangoo in 2020, it didn't make it with a long wheelbase option. But that was changed during the 2023 model update. With the new update, the car got a refreshed front fascia, which sported the carmaker's design language. The headlights sported LED daytime running lights incorporated into the headlamps and forming a C-shape. Between them, the automaker installed a broad grille that was mostly masked for the entire range and sported the big and chromed carmaker's badge in the middle. From its profile, the Kangoo revealed its steep panoramic windscreen, suitable for such a tall greenhouse. Passengers could get onboard via the front-hinged front doors or the sliding doors for the rear occupants. Behind it, Renault added a wide window. Finally, at the back, the carmaker didn't bother with aerodynamic enhancements and created a vertical drop for the tailgate. But the most significant advantage of the Grand Kangoo was its interior space. This version offered enough room for up to seven passengers seated in three rows (2-3-2). For easier ingress and egress of the rearmost seated occupant, Renault created wider sliding doors on the sides and a lower entry step. In addition, the trunk was big enough for most situations. If customers wanted to use the vehicle as a utility one, they could fold or completely remove the second and the third row of seats. Under the hood, Renault installed a range of gasoline, diesel, and electric motors. The spark-ignited version was a 1.33-liter turbocharged powerplant that offered 130 PS (128 HP), while the oil burner offered just 95 ponies (94 HP) sent to the front wheels. The former version was paired with either a six-speed manual or a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch), while the latter was mated exclusively with a six-speed manual. Besides the ICE versions, the 2023 Grand Kangoo offered an option for electron-powered drivetrains fueled by a 45 kWh battery pack. Renault offered the electric version with an extended warranty of eight years or 160,000 km (roughly 100,000 miles). The battery pack could've been charged at 80kWh chargers, and the automaker promised that the car could gain about 80 km (50 miles) in about ten minutes of charging.",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Kangoo"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""long wheelbase"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""tall greenhouse"", ""spacious interior"", ""versatile"", ""efficient""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""steep panoramic""],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [""refreshed""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""C-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""front-hinged"", ""sliding for rear occupants""],    ""doors"": [""wider sliding"", ""lower entry step""],    ""roof"": [""panoramic""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
RENAULT Kardian,"In late 2023, Renault unveiled a new model for the South American market: the Kardian. It was a B-segment crossover built on a new platform that offered a stylish look for its segment, augmented by newly developed engines. The French automaker had a strong presence in the South American continent and pushed its R&D department to create a vehicle able to lead the B-segment. As a result, in 2023, Renault introduced the Kardian as an alternative to similar vehicles, combining a short overall length with higher ground clearance and a spacious cabin fit for five adults and some luggage with powerful enough engines and advanced safety systems. This product also served as a test bench for the new platform, which eventually was used on other Renault models. Renault created the Kardian with its latest design language elements, such as the backlit logo that took center stage on the reversed trapezoidal grille adorned by a 3D diamond pattern. This was flanked by the headlights, which sat lower, below the LED daytime running lights. Moving lower onto the bumper, the design team created a broad second grille underlined by a plastic shield sporting an aluminum-look finish. From its profile, the car’s higher ground clearance was emphasized by the black plastic moldings around the wheel arches and the side sills. As an option, the Kardian was available with a contrasting roof, creating an image of an upscale vehicle. In addition, the automaker added LED blinkers to the door mirrors as an additional element of style and safety. Finally, at the back, the hatchback Kardian featured wider shoulders on the quarter panels. A roof spoiler adorned the slightly tilted forward tailgate at its upper side. For better visibility, Renault installed C-shaped LED taillights that flanked the tailgate and intruded into the rear panel. The bumper was divided into two horizontal areas, where the upper one was in body color while the lower was black. Inside, the carmaker tried to emphasize the upscale look of the vehicle by adding a display inside the instrument cluster and an eight-inch touchscreen on the dashboard in a free-floating position. The center stack housed the controls for the HVAC system carried over from other European models, such as the Dacia Duster. Furthermore, the center console housed the gear selector for the automatic transmission, where fitted, and the switch for the parking brake. Fronting the driver was a three-spoke steering wheel fitted with physical buttons that accessed the commands for the infotainment unit and the car’s onboard computer. The front seats were slightly bolstered and were covered in fabric upholstery, while the rear bench seat was wide enough to accommodate three passengers, although just for short trips. But the most surprising part of the vehicle was the abundance of safety systems that Renault offered on the Kardian. It offered the car with a blind spot monitor, adaptive cruise control, and automated emergency braking. These features were not mandatory in Brazil, where Renault launched the vehicle, but played an important role in the carmaker’s philosophy about safety. Under the hood, Renault installed an inline-three turbocharged gasoline engine that produced 125 PS (123 hp) and 220 Nm (162 lb-ft.) of torque paired to an EDC (dual-clutch) automatic transmission that drove the front wheels.",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Kardian"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""B-segment crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""Stylish"", ""Spacious"", ""Upscale"", ""Advanced"", ""Safe""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""Reversed trapezoidal"", ""3D diamond pattern""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED daytime running"", ""Lower position""],    ""bumper"": [""Broad second grille"", ""Plastic shield with aluminum-look finish"", ""Two horizontal areas""],    ""wheel"": [""Black plastic moldings around wheel arches and side sills""],    ""doors"": [""LED blinkers on door mirrors""],    ""roof"": [""Contrasting roof option""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""Roof spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
RENAULT Kiger,"Renault was on the verge of promoting new vehicles in its lineup, and its testing ground was the highly competitive Indian market, where it chose to launch the Kiger at the beginning of 2021. Despite a bad 2020, with a world affected by the pandemic situation, Renault relentlessly launched new models either under its brand or under the Dacia, Nissan, Infiniti, or Samsung ones. The Kiger was introduced on the Indian market as a sub-compact crossover using the CMFA+ platform. Renault's designers made a completely new design language for the French brand, and they tried it on the market. The Kiger featured two distinct areas separated by a black, horizontal slat in the front bumper at front. Above it, Renault installed a wide grille with narrow headlights and LED daytime running lights. Its raked A-pillars made the crossover looks sportier. The carmaker made a floating-roof design over the C-pillars, with a dark area, following the same design style from the Nissan Micra. Inside, the Kiger featured a 7"" TFT display in the instrument cluster and an 8"" touch-screen on top of the center stack for the infotainment system. Some buttons and controls were similar to those installed on the Dacia or other Renault vehicles. Its interior dimensions showed that the car offered an adequate room for four average-sized passengers. In the back, the split-folding bench allowed a trunk volume increase from 405 liters (14.3 cu-ft) to 879 liters (31 cu-ft). Under the hood, Renault installed a choice of two engines with the same 1.0-liter displacement. The naturally aspirated version provided 72 hp, while the turbocharged one added 28 more ponies.",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Kiger"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""sub-compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""modern"", ""distinct"", ""wide grille"", ""narrow headlights""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [""wide"", ""horizontal slat""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""narrow"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""front""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""floating"", ""dark area""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
RENAULT City K-ZE,"The Renault City K-ZE was the 6th fully electric vehicle in the Renault range and also the cheapest available on the market. The crossover design offered great quality for its price and was basically a Renault Kwid with an electric power train. The exterior was specific to the new Renault’s language and the K-Ze offered a premium look. The interior had nice finishes, and even if lots of hard black plastics were used, they were well put together. Luxury was not a word to defined the K-Ze’s cabin, however, the storage spaces offered were decent and the seats were comfortable. Surprisingly, a big infotainment with a good image quality was offered. Designed for city use only, the K-Ze offered only 44 hp and 120 nM. A single speed transmission was offered. The K-Ze weighed only 921 kg and was able to reach 60 kph in less than 7 seconds. The top speed was rated at 105 kph. The narrow wheels mounted on the K-Ze were designed to save electricity. The chassis was pretty solid for such a cheap car and the steering was adequate even on corners. The K-Ze had an estimated range of 271 km, however, Renault advised on a maximum of 350 km depending on the road and driving conditions.",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Renault City K-ZE"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""crossover"", ""premium"", ""city-friendly""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""compact"", ""sleek""],    ""headlights"": [""modern""],    ""bumper"": [""simple""],    ""wheel"": [""narrow"", ""electricity-saving""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
RENAULT Rafale,"The 2024 Renault Rafale represents a unique SUV produced by the French brand. It inherits its name and some features from Renault's aviation past, especially the Caudron-Renault Rafale plane from 1934. The compact SUV has a 200 hp (202 Ps) E-Tech full hybrid gasoline powertrain paired with a clutchless multimode automatic dog box. Two electric motors complement a 1.3-liter, three-cylinder turbocharged internal combustion engine. The multimode automatic dog box combines the four ratios of the ICE with the two ratios of the electric motors to offer 15 different combinations of output from them. These variations are automatically selected by the dog box transmission to enable different driving modes like all-electric, all-combustion, dynamic hybrid (the engine and motors work alongside one another), e-drive (the motor spins the wheels, and the engine charges the battery), and regeneration. The Rafale has the most up-to-date version of the 4CONTROL Advanced four-wheel drive system to boost its handling and provide a more facile driving experience. At low to moderate speeds, the back wheels of the car turn (for a maximum of one degree) the same way as the front wheels to improve the SUV's stability. At very low speeds, the rear wheels turn up to five degrees in the opposite direction of the front wheels for increased agility and a reduced turning radius for the Renault. Although built on the modular CMF-CD platform, the fastback body combined with the increased ground clearance portrays the vehicle with a unique sporty appearance. To further improve the car's aerodynamic performance and complement the Rafale's athletic silhouette, the back windshield is tilted approximately 17 degrees. The exterior's main attraction, the redesigned front grille, provides an optical illusion when viewed from different angles, as its 3D elements seem to offer multiple grille appearances. Built with the help of artificial intelligence, the Deep Glossy Black diamond pattern enhances the look of Renault's logo to establish the modern aspect of the vehicle. Besides the two new colors, White Pearl Satin and a new Alpine Blue tone, the SUV represents an innovative approach of Renault's design department also because of its distinctive headlights that are inspired by the Clio model. A Solarbay sunroof represents one of the most impressive interior features of the Rafale. The voice-activated smart glass roof offers four roof settings: all light, all dark, light in the front and dark behind, and the reverse. The interior is also marked by the Alpine-inspired front seats with an illuminated logo and reinforced sides that offer a better driving experience. Also, the OpenR digital cockpit enhances connectivity with all the vehicle's functions. With a modern look, generous space, and innovative features, the 2024 Renault Rafale represents a vision of the brand's future direction in the automotive industry.",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Renault Rafale"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""compact SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""modern"", ""innovative"", ""athletic"", ""distinctive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""tilted"", ""aerodynamic""],    ""grille"": [""redesigned"", ""optical illusion"", ""3D elements""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""distinctive"", ""inspired by Clio""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""four-wheel drive system""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""Solarbay sunroof"", ""voice-activated smart glass""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
RENAULT Pulse,"Especially designed for the Indian market, the Renault Pulse was launched in 2011 and started selling in early 2012. The city car was entirely designed by the Alliance Design Centre based in Mumbai. It had the look of a combination between the Nissan Micra and the Renault Twingo. Intended for the young, urban clientele, the Pulse shared the platform with the Nissan Micra and was equipped with a 1.5-liter dCi Diesel engine that produced around 63 hp. The Pulse was also available with a 1.2-liter gasoline powerplant. The Renault Pulse benefited from a 4-year worry-free guarantee and the Renault “Complete Care” service. The French manufacturer expected the Pulse to sell well, as in Indian, four out of five cars sold were city cars. The ride quality of the small car was impressive, with a comfortable suspension being able to absorb bumps on the road. Due to the soft suspension, some body roll was noticeable in turns. A rounded and oval theme of the interior was borrowed from the Micra, with round cluster of buttons on the central console and round vents. While the Pulse was a small car, the cabin was roomy, with generous legroom and headroom. The trunk size was good and the rear seats folded down.",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Renault Pulse"",  ""year"": ""2011"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""city car"", ""youthful"", ""urban"", ""rounded"", ""roomy""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""rounded""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""compact""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""compact""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""roomy""],    ""roof"": [""compact""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
RENAULT Alaskan,"The first pick-up ever released by Renault, the Alaskan was a massive, robust and well-finished vehicle. The Renault Alaskan had a muscular design that highly appealed to those looking for adventures. Most of the components were borrowed from the bigger brother Nissan Navara, with the exception of the hood, the wings, the front and rear, as well as the wheels. Moreover, the Alaskan was produced at the Nissan’s plant in Barcelona. At least, the Alaskan was equipped with a French engine taken from the Master van, the 2.3-liter unit developing 160 or 190 hp. The interior was simple, classic and well put together, however, it looked and felt dated for 2016. The plastics were not very refined, however, the controls were intuitively placed and within reach. With an increased rigidity of the chassis, the Alaskan had a towing capacity of 3.5 tonnes. While a stiffer chassis should compromise comfort, the five-link rear suspension kept the ride as comfortable as it could get, as the Alaskan was, after all, a 4x4 professional utility rather than a luxurious vehicle. With a generous ground clearance of over 22 centimetres, the Alaskan handled rocky or muddy roads without problems. As expected, the handling was not very precise, a very common thing among pick-ups. U-Turn on narrow streets were tedious and driving the Alaskan in the urban traffic was not an option. The Alaskan was designed for people living in the country side.",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Renault Alaskan"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""massive"",  ""overall-design"": [""muscular"", ""robust"", ""adventurous"", ""well-finished""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""robust""],    ""hood"": [""unique""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""borrowed""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
RENAULT Sandero,"When Renault introduced the Dacia Sandero on the market, it aimed it at customers looking for an affordable, small-sized hatchback, but the result was much better than that. Dacia was part of the Renault brand, and it was responsible for designing and producing the small hatchback on the same platform as the Logan. It was launched in 2007, and its low price was highly appreciated during the world economic crisis, and Renault sold it in high volumes all over the world. In Brazil, Renault's design studio adapted the car to the Brazilian market and included a sportier-looking version named GT Line. The carmaker installed a new front bumper. It featured a lower mesh-grille in the middle that descent to the apron. A set of round fog lights flanked it on the sides. Renault Brazil installed a set of decals on the front fenders and a unique set of eight-spoke light-alloy wheels on its sides. In the rear, a roof-spoiler visually enhanced the car's look. As a final touch, the door-mirrors sported a piano-black finish, regardless of the car's color. Inside, Renault installed a different audio system than the rest of the Sandero range and GT-line embroidering on the front seats' headrests. A white-dial tachometer replaced the standard, black-dial one from the rest of the Sandero range on the instrument panel. The carmaker added red stitching and trims on the center stack and the door panels to complete the sporty interior. Under the hood, Renault installed a 1.6-liter gasoline engine that provided 106 hp. It wasn't much, but since the car weighed just 1,055 kg (2,326 lbs), it provided decent performance for its class.",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Dacia Sandero"",  ""year"": ""2007"",  ""size"": ""small-sized hatchback"",  ""overall-design"": [""affordable"", ""sporty"", ""compact""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""mesh"", ""lower"", ""sporty""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""round""],    ""bumper"": [""front"", ""lower""],    ""wheel"": [""eight-spoke"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [""piano-black finish""],    ""roof"": [""spoiler"", ""enhanced""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof-spoiler"", ""visually enhanced""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
RENAULT Logan,"In 2014, Renault introduced the second generation of the Dacia Logan as a badge-engineered version of the Romanian car, albeit with several modifications to the powertrain. While Dacia launched the second generation of the Logan in 2012, its Renault-badged sibling had to wait for another two years before its unveiling. Thus, in 2014, Renault Logan showed up in front of customers from Russia or South America. Not paying the exterior design team with lunch money paid off, and the second generation of the Logan got a better look than its wedged-shaped predecessor. Thus, the headlights were slightly swept-back, and the two-slat grille was adorned with chromed elements. In addition, both the front and rear fenders showed a muscular stance due to their flared stance. In addition, the flush door handles and the door mirrors' caps were body-colored for a much more modern look. Some of the most significant upgrades were for the car's interior, which provided room for five adult passengers, and a 60/40 split-folding rear bench. Yet, the front seats were still flat and covered with cheap fabric. Renault chose a new design for the dashboard with organic shapes and silver trims. Like its Romanian sibling, the French brand offered an option for a touchscreen infotainment system on the center stack. Even though it wasn't mounted in the most accessible position, it was still an improvement compared with Logan's previous generation. Renault didn't need to install Euro 6-compatible engines under Logan's hood for Russia or South America. Yet, it used its inline-three, one-liter engine as a base version, with an option for a more powerful 1.6-liter, albeit the 8-valve version instead the punchy 16-valve one.",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Renault Logan"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""modern"", ""muscular"", ""flared"", ""roomy""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""swept-back""],    ""grille"": [""two-slat"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""flush"", ""body-colored""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
RENAULT SCENIC XMOD,"The XMOD was the crossover version of the well-known European Renault Scenic MPV. It was introduced in 2013 as an alternative for the light-SUV category. Back in the late '90s, Renault offered a 4x4 version for the Renault Scenic. It was named Scenic RX4 and it was built together with the off-road specialist Magna-Steyr. After the alliance with Nissan, the RX4 version was cut out of the production line. In 2013, the Scenic XMOD was introduced on the market to fill the gap for the buyers who were searching for a light-offroad vehicle, but with plenty of storage room inside. When compared to the standard Scenic, the XMOD version featured black bumpers and side protections. In the front, the LED daytime running lights were installed in the bumper, where the fog-lights usually are. The honeycomb-style for the grille and a silver plastic shield on under the bumper visually enhanced the Scenic's look. The 16” light-alloy wheels were fitted as standard and the high tire sidewall ensured a better grip when driven on unpaved roads. Inside, the XMOD was as spacious as any other Scenic. The digital dashboard featured a display for the main information regarding speed and trip-computer and a navigation system. On the center console in front of the gear stick, there was a rotary knob for off-road use. In the back, the XMOD featured three individual seats that could have been tilted, folded, or completely removed. Unlike the RX4, the XMOD was front-wheel-drive only but fitted with a special ESP program that acted like a self-locking differential, braking the wheel with less grip. For the engine, the Renault counted for the 1.6-liter turbocharged diesel engine.",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Renault Scenic XMOD"",  ""year"": ""2013"",  ""size"": ""light-SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""spacious"", ""off-road"", ""functional"", ""modern"", ""practical""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""honeycomb-style"", ""silver plastic shield""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED daytime running""],    ""bumper"": [""black"", ""enhanced with silver plastic shield""],    ""wheel"": [""16” light-alloy"", ""high tire sidewall""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
RENAULT Kwid,"The French car-maker tried to offer a very low priced car for the Indian market. But the car had to offer the Renault minimum standards. The Kwid was the answer. Renault had a big interest in the Indian market. With over a billion population, India was a highly competitive market for low-priced cars. After the partnership with the local car-maker Mahindra ended, the French car-maker approached the market with a supermini car priced at Indian (very low) prices. It was a car assembled for already developed parts for other cars. The Kwid featured an SUV-inspired front fascia, with a big grille design and Dacia Sandero inspired headlights. The black moldings over the front and rear wheel-arches amplified the cross-over stance. India was known for its bad roads, so the Kwid came equipped with higher ground clearance and a shrunk-SUV style. The side doors featured curved surfaces and, depending on the trim level, plastic side protection against shopping carts. Inside, there was a simple, one-piece, dashboard. On the base model, there was just a speedometer on the instrument cluster and no stereo on the center stack. A Medianav Renault system was included on the options list. For the drivetrain, the Kwid featured a 0.8-liter, or a 1.0-liter engine, mated to a standard 5-speed manual. In Europe, it was expected to be built by Dacia, the most affordable brand in the Renault Alliance.",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Kwid"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""supermini"",  ""overall-design"": [""low-priced"", ""SUV-inspired"", ""cross-over stance"", ""shrunk-SUV style"", ""simple dashboard""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""big"", ""SUV-inspired""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""Dacia Sandero inspired""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""black moldings"", ""amplified cross-over stance""],    ""doors"": [""curved surfaces"", ""plastic side protection""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
RENAULT Triber,"Renault designed a vehicle especially for the Indian and Indonesian market: the Triber. It was launched in 2019 in New Delhi. The car was presented as an MPV, but it had lots of inspiration from the cross-over vehicles such as Kwid or Captur. It featured a total length of 3.99 m (13 ft) due to special tax reasons in India. But the big surprise is that it featured 7 seats inside. With some headlights from the Captur, a platform taken from the Kwid, a high ground clearance of 182 mm (7.2”) and five doors, the Triber looks like it was made by a skilled Lego-master. The design can't be taken as a huge success, but it was OK, especially for the Indian market where practicality is more important. And for the practicality, the powertrain was adapted and tuned accordingly. It had a three-cylinder engine of 1 liter. The low, 72 hp was enough for the 947 kg (2087 lbs) of the vehicle. It even features an optional 5-speed automated EASY-R transmission, which is a 5-speed manual with a computer-controlled single-clutch system. Inside, there was room for seven and even the third row had air-vents for the air-conditioner, not only the driver. The driver had other special features at his hand, such as the infotainment unit that supports both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Triber"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""3.99 m (13 ft) length"",  ""overall-design"": [""MPV"", ""crossover-inspired"", ""practical"", ""skilled"", ""OK""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""from Captur""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""five""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
RENAULT Latitude,"When the Premium market expanded in 2010 after the 2008 world financial crisis, Renault unveiled a car for the up-market called the Latitude. It was based on the Renault-Nissan D platform, which was used also for the Renault Espace minivan, the Samsung SM5 or the Nissan Maxima. It was quite unusual to see a luxury vehicle from the French carmaker, even though it used to have a premium-car contender during the 80s as well, the Safrane. The 4.9m (16 ft) car was a front-wheel-drive only vehicle and had numerous luxury options fitted as standard. Depending on the engines, it had either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. It featured an optional all-wheel-steering system, which helped it turn faster on tight corners. The available engines range between 140 and 240 hp, with three choices of gasoline units and two turbodiesels. Performance were good only for the top V6 engines, either gasoline or turbodiesel. Both of them had 240 hp, but the 3.5-liter gasoline had only 330 Nm (243.4 lb-ft) of torque, while the 3.0-liter turbodiesel had 450 Nm (332 lb-ft) of pulling power. Even so, the 0-100 kph (62 mph) sprint took 6.4  seconds for the gasoline and 7.6 seconds for the latter. Inside, there is room for five adults and a lot of space in the rear thanks to the big, 2.76 m (108.7 in) wheelbase. It offered the best rear-seats room in its class. The trunk was also big, with its 608 liters (21.4 cu-ft) of space. Remember, this is a sedan, not a hatchback or a station wagon. The five-star EuroNCAP rating was also a plus for the vehicle. If they only would have decided to put a rear independent suspension on it...",RENAULT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Latitude"",  ""year"": ""2010"",  ""size"": ""4.9m (16 ft)"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxury"", ""premium"", ""front-wheel-drive"", ""spacious"", ""elegant""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""long"", ""sleek""],    ""headlights"": [""modern""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""large""],    ""doors"": [""roomy""],    ""roof"": [""stylish""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
RIMAC Nevera,"Rimac Nevera was the fastest accelerating hypercar globally when it was introduced in 2020, and the production was limited to 150 units. When Mate Rimac started his company in a garage in Croatia in 2009, he didn't know that he would become the manufacturer of the fastest production car in the world. Rimac created the Nevera following the same design language as other hypercars like it was supposed to have an internal combustion engine. But the Croatian carmaker had to do it like that so its customers would recognize the shape of a high-performance vehicle. Its narrow front end and vents on the lower bumper left the impression that it needed those to cool the engine. Instead, it was built to enhance aerodynamics and cool the battery pack. The raked, curved windshield and the sloped roofline followed the same aerodynamic principles of any other supercar on the market at that time. A particular addition was the ""cravat"" (necktie) design trim placed in front of the rear wheels that sported the colors of the country where the vehicle was sold. The cabin was handcrafted using the highest quality materials available. Everything was developed in-house, and that led to an exclusive interior. The seats were divided by a wide and tall center console that hosted part of the battery pack. Even the infotainment system placed at the bottom of the center stack was also built by the Croatian company. Its monitor was accompanied by a secondary touch-screen installed in front of the side passenger. At the same time, the driver used a TFT display inside the instrument cluster. Power went in all corners thanks to a four-motor layout and produced a total of 1,914 PS (1,888 hp), paired to a two-speed automatic gearbox, which enabled the hypercar to exceed the performances of a Bugatti Veyron.",RIMAC,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Rimac Nevera"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""narrow front end, sloped roofline"",  ""overall-design"": [""fast"", ""aerodynamic"", ""exclusive"", ""handcrafted"", ""high-performance""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked"", ""curved""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""vents"", ""lower""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
RIVIAN R1S,"The young American electric carmaker Rivian announced the seven-passenger SUV simultaneously as the R1T pickup. While it wasn't the first electric SUV on the market, the R1S featured innovative solutions that made it an excellent off-road vehicle and a family car as well. It shared most of its components with its pickup brother, but some differences made it stand apart from the rest of the 4x4 vehicles. The R1S featured a two-box bodywork like most of the SUVs on the market. It stood on a shortened version of its pickup brother, but it was the same vehicle up to the B-pillar. The carmaker designed a shorter rear overhang and a closed trunk with windows on all sides in the back. Inside, Rivian tried to offer the vehicle in three versions and then added more package options. But the safety was not optional, and the car was fit for the level 2 autonomous driving mode. Like its mid-sized pickup, the SUV featured an electro-chromatic panoramic glass-roof that could be tinted or lightened according to the driver's mood. Rivian installed a wide touch-screen for various car functions and the infotainment system in the middle of the dashboard. Instead of a regular instrument cluster, the driver relied on another display. For the powertrain, the R1T featured four electric motors for the entire range. The base version featured fewer battery cells than the full version, but that still gave it a range of over 200 miles (320 km). The middle version was the quickest one, rocketing from 0 to 60 in three seconds. Rivian stated that the range was 400 miles (640 km) for the top of the range version. Its pneumatic suspension allowed a 14"" (35 cm) ground clearance and a wading depth of 3 ft (1 m).",RIVIAN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Rivian R1S"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""mid-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""innovative"", ""off-road"", ""family-friendly"", ""two-box bodywork"", ""shortened rear overhang""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""panoramic"", ""electro-chromatic""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""pneumatic suspension""],    ""doors"": [""wide touch-screen""],    ""roof"": [""panoramic"", ""tintable"", ""closed trunk""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
RIVIAN R1T,"When Rivian said that its truck won't be like anything else on the Planet, we said that ""we heard that before."" Unless this time, the manufacturer was right. While Tesla was struggling with its Cybertruck and smashed its side windows, a new carmaker worked hard to make a pickup even better in Michigan. It wasn't armored, but it was more usable than any other truck on the market. The R1T kept the shape of a pickup, but that was the only connection with the light utility vehicles it existed. Rivian placed the main storage compartment under the hood (frunk), which could have been opened electrically with the keyfob in the pocket. On the sides, behind the doors, there was another storage compartment long enough to sleep in it, but not too wide. In the back, the power-tailgate was able to electrically open 180 degrees so the user could reach easier to the spare-wheel storage space. At the front, the light-bar that crossed the vehicle from left to right was also the charging status bar, and the headlights were, of course, fitted with LEDs. Inside, thanks to its completely flat floor, there was room for five adult passengers with enough legroom and headroom for everyone. Rivian installed a wide touch-screen for various car functions and the infotainment system in the middle of the dashboard. Instead of a regular instrument cluster, the driver relied on another display. For the powertrain, the R1T featured four electric motors for the entire range.

ROLLS-ROYCE Ghost,"The Rolls-Royce brand always had a specific prestige in the motoring industry and it was always used as a landmark for luxury and opulence. In 2020, the British company introduced the new Ghost. With over a century in the automotive industry, Rolls-Royce was the Koh-I-Noor of the British automotive industry. It was purchased by BMW in the late '90s and it evolved rapidly from a single model to a wider range. While its flagship was the Phantom, the Ghost was more of an entry-level. A level where other car-makers had to struggle to offer what the Ghost featured as standard. Rolls-Royce was not concerned about aerodynamic when it was about its cars. The big, massive, front end, with a straight-up and slightly V-shaped radiator grille, was a brand's heritage and it was easy to recognize. It didn't even need a badge for it, but it still had the Spirit of Ecstasy silver statuette on top of the radiator. The LED headlights still kept the same squared shape from the 2009 EX200 concept-car. The minimalist exterior look, with a low profiled greenhouse, made the car looks imposing on the road. The passenger cabin was a luxurious place with seating for five. The large and thick front seats offered the comfort of a six-figure price car that could go effortlessly for long distances. The new technologies used for the dashboard and infotainment system were well integrated into the classic interior look. Maybe the HVAC controls on the center stack resembled too much those existing in the BMW 7-Series, but other than that it was Rolls-Royce as usual. The powertrain was developed around the 6.75-liter twin-turbo engine. It sent its power to its all-wheel-drive and all-wheel-steering system. The Ghost used a modified platform version used for the Rolls-Royce Cullinan as well.",ROLLS-ROYCE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ghost"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""massive, imposing"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""opulent"", ""minimalist"", ""classic"", ""imposing""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""low-profiled""],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""straight-up"", ""V-shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""squared""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""luxurious""],    ""roof"": [""low-profiled""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""twin-turbo""]  }}```"
ROLLS-ROYCE Phantom,"The eighth generation of the majestic Rolls-Royce Phantom was unveiled in the Summer of 2017 and was built on top of a bespoke platform that was later shared with the Cullinan and the Ghost. Ever since BMW had acquired the British luxury brand, its involvement was limited to the words of Sir Henry Royce, who spared no effort in building the best car in the world. He unveiled the first generation of the Phantom in 1925. Almost a century later, his legacy lived on, clearly embedded into the eighth generation of this nameplate. With an exterior design that resembled the previous generation, the 2017 Phantom featured a flat front fascia with the ""Parthenon"" grille up front and squarish-looking laser headlights incorporating the daytime running lights. On the lower side, the bumper was neatly incorporated into the car's shape. It didn't look like an added bodywork element, as it happens with most other vehicles. From its profile, the cab-rearward design was emphasized by the long engine compartment. Also worth mentioning are the rear-hinged rear doors, also known as suicide doors. Rolls-Royce was the only luxury automaker that produced them. At the back, the sloped rear windscreen and the short deck ended the majestic limousine with an elegant design touch. Rolls-Royce created an ultra-luxurious cabin to spoil its customers. Hand-made seats, Connely leather, and real wood trims were just part of the amenities that attracted Phantom's customers. In addition, for the rear-seated passengers, the automaker added a drinks cabinet with whiskey glasses, a decanter, champagne flutes, and a cooled box. The car's platform was made from high-strength aluminum and featured pneumatic, adaptive suspension. Under Rolls-Royce's flagship hood was a BMW-developed twin-turbocharged 6.75-liter V12.",ROLLS-ROYCE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Rolls-Royce Phantom"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""majestic limousine"",  ""overall-design"": [""elegant"", ""luxurious"", ""sophisticated"", ""bespoke"", ""timeless""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""Parthenon""],    ""hood"": [""flat""],    ""headlights"": [""laser"", ""squarish""],    ""bumper"": [""neatly incorporated""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""rear-hinged"", ""suicide""],    ""roof"": [""cab-rearward""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
ROLLS-ROYCE Dawn,"The 2016 Rolls-Royce Dawn was released as part of the Ghost/Wraith family, adding up as a convertible option while retaining the elegance and total comfort for up to four passengers. Design wise, the Dawn doesn't stray from Rolls-Royce's neo-retro shapes, but does manage to look suppler than the rest of its stablemates. The new Dawn was the 3rd convertible released by Rolls Royce in 50 years and was based on the 1952 Silverdawn model. The front comes with a slightly larger grille and bumper compared to the Wraith, while the side looks very clean with a harmonious textile roof that lacks concave surfaces or visible struts. The interior retains the same luxury and quality as with the other model and comes with high-quality real wood trims and leather upholstery, matte or chromed metallic inserts, specially-designed clock, Bespoke Audio system and top-notch sound-deadening materials to keep outside noise from entering when the top is up. Auto journalists were saying that the Dawn is one of the quietest convertibles. The Dawn featured a 6.6-liter V12 engine and the most powerful produced 563 hp and 575 pound-feet of torque. The car reached 60 mph in 4.9 seconds, which was rather impressive for such a massive car. The Dawn was electronically limited to 155 mph.",ROLLS-ROYCE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Rolls-Royce Dawn"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""massive"",  ""overall-design"": [""elegant"", ""supple"", ""harmonious"", ""luxurious"", ""quiet""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""larger""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""larger""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""textile"", ""concave-free""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
ROLLS-ROYCE Cullinan,"We’re pretty sure that most of us didn’t really think about utility or versatility when bringing Rolls Royce up. Or at least that was before the Cullinan, Roll’s first real hatchback. How about a Rolls that was good for going shopping, towing boats and even going for some off-road? The Cullinan was the most luxurious, the most refined and the most expensive SUV on the market. Compared to the Phantom, the Cullinan had a shorter and higher body. Based on Rolls Royce’s ‘Architecture of Luxury’ already featured with the Phantom, the Cullinan had a frame made from aluminum castings, allowing more variability. While the Cullinan shared the same 6.75 V12 twin-turbo engine, the unit was reworked to offer more low-end torque. The power was sent to all 4 wheels through an 8-speed automatic transmission. As expected, the cabin quality was impressive with leather and wood accents, as well as real metal vent controls. For the first time, Rolls offered an optional folding bench seat to replace the fixed rear chairs. Besides that, customers could also get a fixed glass partition between the backseats and the trunk, to lower the noise levels. It was impressive how the Culinan managed to handle forest tracks and rocky paths, offering great comfort and refinement.",ROLLS-ROYCE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Cullinan"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""shorter, higher body"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""refined"", ""expensive"", ""versatile"", ""impressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
ROLLS-ROYCE Spectre,"More than one century ago, Charles Rolls considered that the ultimate luxury car should have an electric motor since it lacked the smell and the vibrations of an internal combustion engine. Fast forward to 2022, and after two World Wars, economic downturns, and technological breakthroughs, the famous British brand finally unveiled its first production-ready electric vehicle. Yet, it was not a limousine but a personal luxury coupe. The most elegant luxury coupe in the world. Right from the start, the Spectre surprised the audience at the 2022 Paris Motor Show with its size. It was larger than many other four-door luxury sedans. Its dominant front fascia featured the broadest grille ever installed on a Rolls-Royce. It was flanked by LED headlights. Like any other Rolls-Royce, the car featured the famous statue of Spirit of Extacy that adorned the hood. The automakers' engineers spent no less than 800 hours adjusting the statue's shape so it could create less drag. On the sides, the majestic coupe revealed a fastback silhouette and massive rear-hinged doors. Another first for the industry was the 23"" light alloy wheels with a unique design. Finally, at the back, the flush-to-bodywork taillights fitted with LED created the illusion of a wider vehicle. Not that it was needed. Inside, Rolls-Royce used only environmentally-friendly materials. There were no dials nor gauges on the instrument cluster, only a wide display. Also, for the infotainment unit, the car manufacturer used a touchscreen. As for the rest of the interior decoration, Rolls-Royce inserted thousands of LEDs in the door cards, the rear panels, and the ceiling. The sound system was custom-made and branded with the carmaker logo. The all-electric powertrain sent the power to all corners of the massive vehicle. But, despite its impressive weight, the Spectre could hit the 60 mph (97 kph) mark from a standstill in less than five seconds.",ROLLS-ROYCE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Spectre"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""larger than four-door luxury sedans"",  ""overall-design"": [""elegant"", ""majestic"", ""dominant"", ""flush-to-bodywork"", ""environmentally-friendly""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broadest""],    ""hood"": [""adorned"", ""adjusted""],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""23\"""", ""light alloy"", ""unique design""],    ""doors"": [""rear-hinged"", ""massive""],    ""roof"": [""fastback silhouette""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
ROLLS-ROYCE La Rose Noire,"When a customer wanted a bespoke Rolls Royce, they went over the edge and, with the help of the British car manufacturer, created a true piece of art on wheels that was priced accordingly. When the ultra-luxurious two-seater was revealed, it was the most expensive new car in the world, with a price of over 30 million USD. Rolls-Royce was not at its first bespoke model, and the La Rose Noire represented a significant statement on a niche market segment focused mostly on high quality than on large quantities. It was a unique vehicle built for a customer that wanted to represent the beauty of the rose noire Baccara (black rose Baccara). But what it achieved had exceeded anyone's imagination and went over the regular rules of a custom vehicle. For the first time in Rolls-Royce's history, the massive Parthenon grille up front was modified to fit the vehicle's overall design. It wasn't flat and straight as on any other member of its family. Instead, it featured a tilted-rearward upper segment. In addition, the vertical slats were no longer silver but finished in a new technique named Hydroshade, developed by Rolls-Royce, especially for this unit. On the lower side of the bumper, the automaker created an additional cooling area adorned with a 3D pattern and underlined by a carbon fiber lip spoiler. Furthermore, the LED headlights were narrow and recessed into the front fascia, creating not just a dynamic image but also a demanding look over the road. From its profile, the automaker made several unique details for the La Rose Noire. First, there were no RR badges and turn signals on the front fenders. The blinkers were moved upwards onto the extensions made for the door handles, and the marque's logo found its place behind the cabin on the upper side. The retractable hard top vehicle featured tall door and side panels and narrow glass areas inspired by the 1920s hot rods. Rolls-Royce bespoke coach builder also created a unique rear end for the vehicle. The rear fascia resembled the back of a yacht, with horizontal lines and vertical LED taillights. Above them, the carmaker painted 96 triangles on the trunk's lid that were inspired by the same rare black Baccara rose. Moving inside the vehicle, the customer discovered a bespoke cabin, where the carmaker incorporated a wristwatch on the dashboard that could have been removed and worn. In front of the driver, the car featured an instrument cluster filled with analog dials. The car manufacturer placed the brand's logo in the middle of the speedometer in metallic accents. Unusual for a Rolls-Royce, the La Rose Noire featured just two seats placed lower on the cabin's floor and separated by a tall center console. Behind them, the designers installed a hand-crafted panel filled with black, gray, and red triangular shapes. The car's roof featured an electrochromic glass panel that could have been darkened or lightened at the touch of a button. Under the hood, the automaker installed a twin-turbo 6.6-liter V12 similar to the one fitted on the Rolls-Royce Wraith, but with 30 HP more and 840 Nm (620 lb-ft) of torque.",ROLLS-ROYCE,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Rolls Royce La Rose Noire"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""bespoke"", ""luxurious"", ""unique"", ""dynamic"", ""demanding""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""tilted-rearward"", ""Hydroshade-finished""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""narrow"", ""recessed""],    ""bumper"": [""additional cooling area"", ""3D pattern"", ""carbon fiber lip spoiler""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""tall"", ""narrow glass areas""],    ""roof"": [""electrochromic glass panel""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""yacht-inspired rear fascia""],    ""exhaust"": [""twin-turbo 6.6-liter V12""]  }}```"
SAAB 9-3 Aero,"Descendants of the mighty Vikings, the Swedish people, didn't want to let SAAB die and tried to revive it after the GM era and produced a limited run for the 9-3 Aero in 2013-2014. After GM sold the Swedish brand in 2009 due to the world financial crisis, the carmaker traded hands a few times before being bought by the National Electric Vehicle Sweden AB in 2012. The new owner had the rights for the brand name but not for the Griffin logo, which belonged to Scania AB. It could produce the 9-3 Aero as well, and that's what it did. But since the car didn't meet the European legislation required for a new car, it had to build just 1,000 units for the old continent. NEVC planned to export the rest of the vehicles in China, where the rules were laxer. The 9-3 Aero featured a slightly changed front fascia, with the SAAB lettering instead of its traditional round badge with the griffin. On the lower part of the bumper, a trapezoidal grille with a mesh design covered most of the apron flanked by two side scoops for the fog lights, with a satin-gray surrounding. A set of silver trims adorned the upper grille. A set of turbine-blade style, 18"" light-alloy wheels confirmed the car's sporty character from its sides. At the back, a dual exhaust peaked out under the bumper. Inside, SAAB engineers designed and installed new, bolstered bucket seats. More silver trims enhanced the black and tan dashboard look and surrounded the instrument cluster, which was extended over the center stack. These were the main differences compared to the 9-3 Aero from the GM era. Under the hood, NEVC bought the engines from GM, which used the same powerplant in the Insignia. But, unlike the European sedan, the 9-3 Aero provided just 220 horses, 30 less than the Opel's mid-size vehicle.",SAAB,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""9-3 Aero"",  ""year"": ""2013-2014"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""limited run"", ""sporty character"", ""bolstered bucket seats"", ""silver trims"", ""dual exhaust""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""trapezoidal"", ""mesh design"", ""satin-gray surrounding""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""apron flanked"", ""lower part"", ""trapezoidal grille"", ""side scoops"", ""fog lights""],    ""wheel"": [""turbine-blade style"", ""18\"" light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual""]  }}```"
SANTANA PS 10 Pickup,"The Spanish carmaker Santana built a licensed Land Rover in the late '50s, and they kept producing updated versions until Iveco purchased them. In 1958, Land Rover sent complete knock-down kits (CKD) in Spain to be assembled as Land Rover by the Metalurgica de Sant Ana S.A. After the Land Rover Series II stopped, the Spanish factory continued to assemble the Series III, but with some minor improvements. Later on, Santana built its vehicles from scratch but based on the Land Rover parts. It was an agreement between the two companies, and the Spanish carmaker ended up with a license for the Series III. That said, the Santana PS 10 was, in fact, a well built Land Rover Series III, which was the predecessor for the Defender. Its straight lines, body panels, and doors were similar to the Land Rover Series III. Still, it featured dual round headlights instead of single ones and vertical taillights instead of small, round ones found on the Defender or Series III. The pickup-truck version kept the same short-wheelbase from the Series III, with a slightly extended cabin so the driver and its passenger could adjust their seats. Some versions were fitted with three seats at the front, although the middle passenger should figure out how to avoid the transmission and gear-levers. Unlike the Defender, which was already an all-wheel-drive vehicle, the Santana remained a 4x4 vehicle with low range gear and leaf springs. That made it less comfortable, but a very tough, rugged vehicle.",SANTANA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Santana PS 10"",  ""year"": ""late '50s"",  ""size"": ""short-wheelbase"",  ""overall-design"": [""straight lines"", ""rugged"", ""tough""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""straight"", ""similar to Land Rover Series III""],    ""headlights"": [""dual round""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""4x4"", ""low range gear""],    ""doors"": [""similar to Land Rover Series III""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SANTANA PS 10 Shortline,"With a license to build a Land Rover in its portfolio, the Spanish carmaker Santana kept that model alive until Iveco bought them and transformed the car into an Iveco Massif. The Metalirgica de San Ana S.A. Bought a license for the Land Rover Series II in 1958 and built it from Complete Knock-down kits (CKD). After the British brand ended the series, Santana made the panels and continued building the car in all shapes and sizes, with a long or short wheelbase, a pickup, or a closed body version. The PS10 Shortline was the short wheelbase version with two doors and five seats. That said, the Santana PS 10 was, in fact, a well-built Land Rover Series III, which was the predecessor for the Defender. Its straight lines, body panels, and doors were similar to the Land Rover Series III. Still, it featured dual round headlights instead of single ones. The rear passengers could have slide-open the side windows to get more fresh air. Santana installed vertical taillights instead of small, round ones found on the Defender or Series III. Inside, the PS 10 Shortline offered a pair of seats at the front and a folding bench in the rear. For the dashboard, the carmaker installed an instrument cluster that sported a big dial for the speedometer flanked on the sides, in individual clusters, by the tachometer on the left and a pair of gauges on a common dial on the right. Between the front seats, the carmaker offered an armrest as an option.

SEAT Arona,"After three years and more than 350,000 units sold, SEAT introduced a facelifted version for its subcompact crossover in 2021. With all the hype created by the crossover and SUV market, SEAT introduced a new range of vehicles that matched the customers' preferences. The Arona was the smallest one, followed by the Ateca and Tarraco. They shared three variations of the same MQB platform, with the Arona built on the A0 version. SEAT decided to switch to LED technology for Arona's headlights, as a standard feature for the entire range, with Eco LED for the base level and an option for full LED, which was included as standard from the FR upwards trim levels. For the back of the car, SEAT slightly modified the taillights and changed the underbody diffuser. Inside, the Spanish carmaker introduced a new dashboard design, with an 8.25"" touch-screen for the infotainment system included as standard for the base model and a 9.2"" from the SE Technology upwards. Exclusively for the FR and Xperience Lux, SEAT installed a wide, 10.25"" Digital Cockpit. Like its predecessor, the 2021 model featured two bucket seats at the front and a split-folding bench in the rear. The trunk offered 400 liters (14.1 cu-ft) of space with the seats up and 1,280 liters (45.2 cu-ft) with the backseats folded. Under the hood, the Arona received a choice of four engines ranged between 90 hp and 150 hp. A 1.0-liter TGI, with gasoline and CNG, was available on selected markets.",SEAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Arona"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""subcompact crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""facelifted"", ""compact"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""modified"", ""underbody""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SEAT Ibiza 5 Doors,"SEAT introduced the fifth generation of the Ibiza small-segment car in 2017 at the Geneva Motor Show and, four years later, it unveiled the facelifted version. While the world pandemic was still on, the Spanish carmaker had to adapt and showed the 2021 Ibiza online. Even though it was very difficult to distinguish the facelifted version from the 2017 model, the carmaker brought more improvements to the small vehicle, which shared its MQBA0 platform with the SEAT Arona crossover and other Volkswagen products. At the front, the 2021 Ibiza switched to LED technology as standard - Eco-LEDs and the option for Full LEDs. That addition made the car show an enhanced, sportier look. In the back, the only visible change was the handwriting-style Ibiza badge from the tailgate. In addition to that, the carmaker offered a choice of two new, 17"" light-alloy wheels and another one with 18"" diameter. Inside, there was a radical change for the dashboard, which featured a new 8.25"" infotainment screen fitted as standard with an option for a 9.25"". For the instrument cluster, the Ibiza sported analog dials with an option for a 10.25"" TFT display. With all these included, the 2021 Ibiza's interior became fully digital. To add more style to the cabin, SEAT included new vents and LED lights around them, on the driver's and front passenger's sides. SEAT dropped all the turbo-diesel engines from its range and kept only four gasoline and one bi-fuel unit. The latter was a CNG/Gasoline turbocharged unit.",SEAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ibiza"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""enhanced"", ""sportier"", ""radical"", ""digital"", ""stylish""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""Eco-LEDs"", ""Full LEDs""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""17\"" light-alloy"", ""18\"" diameter""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SEAT Leon,"SEAT unveiled the fourth generation of its successful Leon lineup in 2020 at the Martorell factory at the beginning of 2020, and it was available in two shapes: a hatchback and a station wagon. Unlike the third generation of the Leon, this one was no longer available in a three-door configuration. The world was already aware of the upcoming pandemic situation, and automakers tried to release their latest models as soon as they could. In Spain, things were somehow relaxed since only in mid-March the lockdown started, and at the end of January, SEAT launched the Leon Mk IV. The car was based on the same MQB Evo platform shared with the Volkswagen Golf, Skoda Octavia, and Audi A3. But unlike its siblings, the Leon had the most aggressive exterior design. In addition, it was also the starting point for the sporty brand Cupra, which previously was just a trim level for the SEAT brand. At the front, the 2020 Leon featured an angular design with a shield-like grille adorned by a chicken-wire pattern design and surrounded by a gray-satin rim. Its LED headlights incorporated triangular-shaped daytime running lights, and the headlamps featured a narrower inner area than on their outer side. The lower bumper sported a lower grille flanked by fake air scoops that sported the optional LED fog lamps. From its profile, the Leon showed sculptured doors and a sloped-down roofline with a tiny triangular third window behind the rear doors. At the back, the tilted forward tailgate featured a roof spoiler where the third brake light found its place. Underneath the rear bumper, SEAT placed fake exhausts. Still, the most attractive side of the rear fascia was the red light bar that crossed the vehicle from side to side, connecting the taillights. The interior design sported a minimalist design but with a display for the instrument cluster instead of analog dials. Atop the center stack, SEAT used the same touchscreen as the Golf, and just like its sibling, it didn’t feature a turning knob for the volume. Most buttons were touch-sensitive, and that made them difficult to operate during nighttime driving situations. The standard front seats in the base model were quite supportive, but the automaker also offered a set of high-bolstered ones for the upper trim levels, such as the FR. In the back, there was room for three adults on the split-folding seat bench, but with limited legroom for the middle-seated passenger. Under the hood, the automaker installed a choice of gasoline or diesel engines, which sent their power to the front wheels only via five or six-speed manuals or six or seven-speed automatics (dual clutch). Surprisingly, even if the Golf and the A3 were available with an all-wheel-drive system, the SEAT was not. Instead, those who wanted to get the car with traction on all four corners could get the Cupra-branded version.",SEAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Leon"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""sporty"", ""minimalist""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""shield-like"", ""chicken-wire pattern""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""triangular-shaped"", ""narrower inner area""],    ""bumper"": [""lower grille"", ""fake air scoops"", ""optional LED fog lamps""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [""sloped-down"", ""triangular third window""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": [""fake exhausts"", ""red light bar""]  }}```"
SEAT Ateca,"The Spanish brand SEAT introduced the compact SUV Ateca in 2015 at the Geneva Motor Show as a sibling for the Volkswagen Tiguan, but with a sportier look. Five years later, it received a facelift. The mid-life refresh for the Ateca brought new safety features and cleaner, Euro 6d, engines in the lineup. To emphasize those, the Spanish brand prepared a modified exterior look as well. Some elements were mandatory due to the 2021 European regulations. The SEAT Ateca was based on the MQB platform, like most of the Volkswagen Group vehicles. On the front, the designers installed a new, wider, hexagonal grille with a 3D design. For the headlights, they prepared a daytime running light pattern with LED that followed the headlamps contour. The slim taillights made the car look taller than it was. The interior went through a significant revamp and, depending on the trim level. It was fitted as standard with a 10.25” digital instrument cluster. An additional 8.25” or 9.2” touch-screen display for the infotainment unit, depending on the trim level or options, completed the digital instrumentation of the interior. The SEAT Ateca integrated some of the most advanced driver assistance systems available, including Predictive Adaptive Cruise Control, Side and Exit Assist, and Front Assist with Pre-Crash braking. These technologies made the compact SUV safer. Under the hood, the Ateca was fitted with a choice of diesel and gasoline turbocharged engines. While the base model featured a front-wheel-drive configuration with just 110 hp, the top of the range 190 hp 2.0-liter unit was fitted as standard with an all-wheel-drive system. Depending on the engine choice, a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed automatic (DSG – dual-clutch) were fitted as standard.",SEAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""SEAT Ateca"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""compact SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""tall"", ""revamped""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wider"", ""hexagonal"", ""3D""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""slim"", ""LED"", ""contoured""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SEAT Leon ST Estate,"In 2020, right before the world pandemic situation, SEAT was forced to find a solution to launch its well-known lineup Leon, and it found it: it unveiled the car at its Martorell factory in Spain. Along with the fourth generation of the compact hatchback, it also revealed the second generation of the station wagon version of it, named Sportstourer. SEAT unveiled both the hatchback and the station wagon at its factory at Martorell in late January 2020, before lockdown. After that, the industry stopped, and the cars had to wait better days to be received by their customers. Fortunately, those days came later that year, and the Sportstourer, together with its hatchback sibling, finally enjoyed the smooth tarmac of Spain and other European countries. Both versions were built on the same MQB Evo platform shared with the Volkswagen Golf and Skoda Octavia, but unlike its siblings, it featured a more emotional design, typical for the Spanish brand. At the front, the 2020 Leon Sportstourer featured an angular design with a shield-like grille adorned by a chicken-wire pattern design and surrounded by a gray-satin rim. Its LED headlights incorporated triangular-shaped daytime running lights, and the headlamps featured a narrower inner area than on their outer side. The lower bumper sported a lower grille flanked by fake air scoops that sported the optional LED fog lamps. Unlike its hatchback sibling, the Sportstourer featured a roof line extended behind the rear seats over the longer rear overhang than the regular Leon. Still, to keep the “sports” spirit, the vehicle featured a raked forward tailgate adorned by a roof spoiler. Inside, the automaker offered standard bucket seats at the front separated by a tall center console that housed the gear stick (or the gear selector for the automatic transmission versions) and a storage compartment under the center armrest. On the center stack, the automaker offered an 8.25” touchscreen for the standard unit system, while a 10” one was available as an option. The system was carried over from the Golf and didn’t have a turning knob for the volume or regular controls for the HVAC system. Everything was with touch buttons and sliders. Fronting the driver was a 10.25” digital display that replaced the dials inside the instrument cluster, and there, the driver could choose what to see. In the back, the split-folding bench seat could accommodate two passengers comfortably due to the tall center tunnel that crossed the car from front to back. Behind them, the Sportstourer offered a generous 617 liter (21.8 cu-ft) luggage compartment. Under the hood, the automaker installed a choice of gasoline or diesel engines, which sent their power to the front wheels only via five or six-speed manuals or six or seven-speed automatics (dual clutch).",SEAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Leon Sportstourer"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""emotional"", ""angular"", ""sporty"", ""extended roof line"", ""raked forward tailgate""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""shield-like"", ""chicken-wire pattern"", ""gray-satin rim""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""triangular-shaped daytime running lights"", ""narrower inner area""],    ""bumper"": [""lower grille"", ""fake air scoops"", ""optional LED fog lamps""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""roof spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SEAT Mii,"The Spanish brand Seat introduced the second iteration of the Mii nameplate in 2019 exclusively as an electric model but with just minor aesthetic changes. The trio of Volkswagen up!, Skoda Citigo, and Seat Mii was built to attract young customers who needed a vehicle for cities, and it did that in 2012. But over time, customers started looking for EVs more than those that used internal combustion engines. So, the German automaker decided to revive all three models and re-launch them in 2019 but this time only with electron-powered motors. As a result, the Mii continued its journey without too many changes to its look. It took a keen eye for detail to notice the upgrades made on the smallest SEAT on the market. These were noticed on the front bumper, which got redesigned and sported new, larger fog lamps. They flanked a broader lower grille, even though the car didn't need that much cooling area since it was electric. The automaker added a sticker on the sides that said ""Mii electric."" Still, the standard package was rich, with standard 16"" light-alloy wheels. As a no-cost option, the Spanish brand offered a contrasting roof color. The Mii kept the same spacious cabin as the 2012 model, with slim bucket seats at the front and a bench seat suitable for two adult passengers in the back. On the dashboard, the carmaker didn't have the option to install a fancy infotainment system. Still, it offered a phone cradle where customers could fix their smartphone and use it for navigation, music, or phone calls via Bluetooth connectivity. But the most significant upgrade was under the car's skin, where SEAT installed a 36.8 kWh battery instead of the 18.6 kWh one that was previously used.",SEAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mii"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""electric"", ""spacious"", ""modern"", ""compact""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broader"", ""lower""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""larger""],    ""bumper"": [""redesigned"", ""sporty""],    ""wheel"": [""16-inch"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""contrasting""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SEAT Leon SC,"Starting with 2017, the SEAT Leon lineup was increased with the addition of new family members as part of the car's third generation mid-cycle facelift. Alongside the regular 5-door hatchback, SEAT saw fit to begin offering various other body versions, like the ST station wagon, ST X-Perience crossover and SC 3-door hatchback. By far the sportiest-looking version, the Leon SC (Sports Coupe) is a classic take on the hot-hatch look thanks to its vastly different exterior design compared to the 5-door version. The mid-cycle refresh doesn't comprise too many exterior changes, with SEAT designers and engineers choosing to simply perfect the existing package without spoiling the original lines of the pre-facelift model. Most of the exterior changes revolve around the front of the model, which now features a revamped, slightly wider engine grille and redesigned headlight clusters. Front and rear bumpers are all-new and now come with LED technology that also includes the turn signals and fog lights. On the inside, the new center console is made from improved materials, while an electric parking brake is now part of standard equipment. The diesel engine lineup starts with a 1.6-liter diesel with 90 horsepower and goes all the way to the 2.0 TDI with 184 horsepower. On the gasoline side, the powertrain lineup starts from a 1.2-liter with 110 horsepower  all the way to a 1.8-liter TSI engine with 180 horsepower.",SEAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""SEAT Leon"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""classic"", ""refreshed"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wider"", ""revamped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""redesigned"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""new"", ""front and rear""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""5-door"", ""3-door""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SEAT Altea,"Introduced at the 2006 Paris Motor Show, the Altea Freetrack went through a facelift just three years later. Volkswagen tried to see if it can create a mix between an SUV and a minivan, but it didn't want to do that under its badge. So, it turned toward one of its brands, the Spanish SEAT, which built the car. It was based on the same platform as the MPV Altea XL, which featured a long wheel drive. But then, it had some other tricks in its sleeves. Maybe the exterior design was not the strongest point of the Alteea Freetrack, but it sure impressed with its black plastic bumpers wrapped-around the bodywork. Moreover, SEAT decided to extend the plastic moldings over the wheel arches both front and rear. Suddenly, the black elements didn't look cheap anymore. They looked to be there with a purpose. The tall MPV with its rounded lines over the bodywork and the silver plastic underbody protection looked like the car could conquer real off-road tracks. Starting with the facelifted version, the Alteea Freetrack featured cornering fog lights. Inside, due to the higher seating position, all the passengers had plenty of room. While the interior materials were not a top priority for the SEAT, there were more hard plastic surfaces than most of the VW Group cars. But that was not an issue as long as the car offered attractive standard amenities such as the air-conditioning, buttons on the steering wheel, and a good sound system, which could have been enhanced with a DVD-player for the rear seat passengers. Under the hood, SEAT offered the Altea Freetrack a choice of five engines, and most of them were fitted with all-wheel-drive systems. An automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox was on the options list.",SEAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Altea Freetrack"",  ""year"": ""2006"",  ""size"": ""tall MPV"",  ""overall-design"": [""rounded lines"", ""black plastic bumpers"", ""silver plastic underbody protection""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""cornering fog lights""],    ""bumper"": [""black plastic"", ""wrapped-around"", ""purposeful""],    ""wheel"": [""extended plastic moldings over wheel arches""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SEAT Leon Cupra R,"In 2017, SEAT unveiled the most powerful version of a road-car ever produced by the Spanish company: the Leon Cupra R. It was based on the regular Cupra, but it was closer to the Golf R. After Volkswagen bought the SEAT brand, it started to slowly increase its image on the market. Even though all of them featured powerplants and transmissions and parts from other Volkswagen Group brands, it had its development strategy that involved racing. Its sportier versions were appreciated by its customers. That made them try a new approach, with the Leon Cupra R. From the outside, the main difference between the Leon Cupra and the R version was the color. There was a choice of three special colors to chose from Midnight Black, Pyrenees Grey (neither with extra cost), and the exclusive Matte Grey. In the back, under the bumper, the Leon Cupra R featured four exhausts for the four-cylinder engine. Inside, there were few differences, starting with a better look for the sport-bucket seats. They featured an integrated headrest. But the rear bench was just as regular as in any other SEAT Leon, with a nicer upholstery. The instrument cluster featured some copper-like details, just to remind the driver that that is a Cupra (copper) car. The 2.0-liter engine offered 310 hp for the manual version and 10 hp less if the car was equipped with the 7-speed DSG (dual-clutch) gearbox.",SEAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Leon Cupra R"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""powerful"", ""sporty"", ""exclusive"", ""copper-like"", ""aggressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""four exhausts"", ""aggressive""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""four-cylinder engine""]  }}```"
SEAT Alhambra,"Volkswagen's Group minivans built its first generation of minivans together with Ford, but for the second generation unveiled in 2010 relied only on its own resources. SEAT Alhambra was one of the MPVs built by the German carmaker under the Spanish brand. While it kept the original idea, it showed a clear evolution in all of its aspects. From its design language to its underpinnings, it was a completely new vehicle, built on top of a Volkswagen platform. Unlike its Volkswagen Sharan sibling, the Alhambra showed a sportier look. Its angular headlights were wide and gave an angry face to the minivan, and the sixteen vertical slats on the black grille offered an imposing presence on the road. The front fascia sported a wrapped-around bumper with a broad grille and two side-scoops for the headlights. From its side, the sloped windshield continued the steep hood. Unlike its predecessor, the second generation of the Alhambra featured sliding rear doors. At the back, the angular taillights were extended from the rear quarter panels to the wide tailgate. Inside, the Alhambra offered room for seven with an option for integrated child seats in the middle row. At the front, the carmaker installed a wide dashboard with a tall center stack for the audio system and the bottom-mounted climate control unit. SEAT designers made an instrument panel with silver rings around the tachometer and speedometer, including the fuel and coolant-temperature gauges on their lower side. Under the hood, SEAT carried over only the 2.0-liter turbo-diesel unit from the Alhambra's facelifted first generation, but the 1.4-liter TSI (turbocharged gasoline) and the 2.0-liter TSI were new. The Spanish carmaker provided up to 220 hp for its MPV, which proved that the angry look was not for nothing.",SEAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""SEAT Alhambra"",  ""year"": ""2010"",  ""size"": ""MPV"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""angular"", ""imposing"", ""evolutionary"", ""roomy""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""wide"", ""black"", ""imposing""],    ""hood"": [""steep""],    ""headlights"": [""angular"", ""wide""],    ""bumper"": [""wrapped-around"", ""broad""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sliding""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SEAT Leon Cupra,"Before it was changed into a different brand, the Cupra was a version of some of the Spanish Seat brand. It defined the most performance models such as Leon. The compact-class vehicle built on the same MQB platform as the Golf shares a lot of components with its German cousin. But the Cupra has different styling and interior. It comes in two body styles: as a three-door or as a five-door vehicle. It is fitted as standard with full LED headlights, a different bumper, and 19"" light-alloy wheels. A roof spoiler and dual oval exhausts are completing the hot-hatch look. From the technical point of view, it is a VW Golf GTI, but with a different look. Some like the Leon Cupra more than the GTI and some like the Golf more. It worth knowing that the Leon Cupra comes as standard with a limited-slip differential and adaptive suspension, features that are available on the Golf only as an extra option.

SEAT Ibiza,"Reaching the 5th generation, the completely redesigned Ibiza brought new features, superior to that of the previous model. In addition to the latest technologies offered, the interior space and comfort were considerably increased. While the Ibiza remained truthful to its young and sporty spirit, it made a step forward and was one of the best looking cars in its segment. From the front, the first thing to notice was the triangular full LED headlights and the iconic daylights graphics that stood out. The 2017 model had a longer wheelbase and window graphics, thus, the spaciousness of the new generation was accentuated. At the back, the Ibiza had strong and clear lines on the tailgate and on the bumper. For the FR trim, the sporty character was accentuated with the side tailpipes. The interior came with a new design and the quality of the materials used was increased. It included new upholstery colors and other decorative insets. New equipment included the Full Link connectivity system, LED ambient lights, a rear-view camera, a wireless charger and an up to 8-inch touchscreen display. The 2017 Ibiza was offered with 4 trim levels: Reference, Style, FR and the XCellence. While the Reference trim level was focused on a sporty feeling with a sports suspension, the XCellence offered better comfort, elegance and technology.",SEAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ibiza"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""spacious"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""elegant"", ""youthful"", ""modern"", ""comfortable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""redesigned""],    ""headlights"": [""triangular"", ""full LED"", ""iconic daylights""],    ""bumper"": [""strong"", ""clear lines""],    ""wheel"": [""longer wheelbase""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SEAT Tarraco,"The biggest SEAT SUV was launched in 2018 and it was based on the MQB-A long wheelbase platform from the parent-company VW. It was the same platform used for the VW Tiguan Allspace and Skoda Kodiaq. The SEAT-specific headlights are angled towards the upside-down hexagonal grille. On the side, the big 4.74 meter (15.5 ft) long car has a simple, clean design, with a single line that unites the front wheel-arch with the taillight. Since the car shares the MQB platform, the wheels seem somehow small for the vehicle. Depending on the trim level, the car features 17” light-alloy wheels. On the top trim level, 19” wheels are installed. Inside the cabin, the Tarraco offers up to seven seats. Aside from a flash of trim across the center of the dashboard, there’s nothing special about the SEAT Tarraco‘s interior design. The driver has a 10.25” display behind the steering wheel. In the center of the dashboard, an eight-inch screen sat proudly. It had colorful graphics and its slick controls mean it recognizes the gestures used on a smartphone. It has a built-in Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The fully-independent suspension provided a good comfort for the SUV. Adaptive dampers were offered as an option, to enhance the road-holding. The engine ranged from a 150 hp gasoline unit up to a 190 hp turbodiesel engine. Standard transmission was a 6-speed manual and an optional 7-speed dual-clutch automatic was offered.",SEAT,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""SEAT Tarraco"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""4.74 meter (15.5 ft) long"",  ""overall-design"": [""clean"", ""simple"", ""spacious"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""angled"", ""hexagonal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""SEAT-specific"", ""angled""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""17” light-alloy"", ""19” top trim level""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SKODA Superb,"Škoda introduced the fourth generation of its flagship sedan, the Superb, in late 2023 for the 2024 model year, continuing its presence in the European midsize-sedan segment. Škoda introduced the Superb nameplate in the 30s, but after WWII, in 1949, the model was withdrawn from the assembly lines. The country needed affordable cars, not expensive and luxurious vehicles powered by V8 gasoline engines. But the nameplate remained in Škoda's inventory, and after Volkswagen bought the Czech automaker, it considered introducing it. That didn't happen until 2001 when it used a long-wheelbase platform of the Volkswagen Passat and created the new Superb. It was an immense success. Not only was the vehicle more comfortable than its shorter German sibling, but it also came with some unique features unseen on budget-friendly cars, such as umbrellas in the rear doors. By 2023, the Superb reached its fourth generation, and just like the second and third generations, it was available in two shapes: sedan and station wagon. The Czech car manufacturer continued to pen its vehicles in the cubist design language. As a result, at first sight, the 2024 Superb looked like a larger Škoda Octavia, its smaller sibling. And yet, there were significant differences other than the longer wheelbase. At the front, the sharp lines of the headlights featured two LED blocks inside them for high and low beams, underlined by the daytime running light strips that were also used for turn signals. The main element of the front fascia was the upper grille, which dominated it with its chromed vertical slats and octagonal shape, where the upper middle section was pinched down. Still, there were no curved lines here either. The lower bumper, on the other hand, sported a second air intake rounded towards the outer sides and featured a diamond-pattern mesh trim. From its profile, the Superb kept its ascending waistline from the previous generation, with an up-kick towards the ends of the rear doors. Finally, the back of the vehicle sported a sloped window and a short deck. On the rear fascia, the taillights' shapes mimicked those of the headlights, a design theme carried over from the Superb's second generation. Last but not least, despite looking like a sedan, the car was actually a hatchback, with its tailgate shaped in two steps: the window and the trunk lid. Inside, customers found an elegant cabin packed with up-to-date technologies, such as a 10"" Virtual Cockpit (digital instrument cluster) and a 13"" touchscreen placed atop the center stack in a free-floating position. Below this, the automaker installed three digital dials that included small displays with a haptic feedback feature. As a result, all of them could control various functions depending on how they were rotated, swiped, or touched. The long wheelbase of the vehicle helped with the legroom for the rear-seated passengers, so there was no problem fitting three adults on the split-folding bench seat. Under its hood, the fourth generation of the Superb offered customers a wide choice of engines that included a mild-hybrid, a plug-in hybrid, three gasoline powerplants, and two turbo-diesel units. All versions were paired with DSG automatic (dual-clutch) transmissions, and the most potent versions were fitted with traction on all corners.",SKODA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Superb"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""midsize"",  ""overall-design"": [""cubist"", ""elegant"", ""modern"", ""sloped"", ""up-kick""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""chromed"", ""octagonal"", ""pinched down""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""sharp"", ""LED"", ""underlined"", ""blocky""],    ""bumper"": [""rounded"", ""diamond-pattern""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""ascending"", ""up-kick"", ""split-folding""],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SKODA Superb Combi / Scout,"The fourth generation of the Superb came in two shapes: sedan and station wagon, the latter being traditionally named Combi by the Czech car manufacturer. Škoda introduced the Superb nameplate in 1934, and it produced that vehicle until 1949, when the automaker had to adapt to its new, after-war status. As a result, it dropped the elegant, V8-powered luxury car and started to build affordable vehicles for the masses. But the Czech brand kept the nameplate in its inventory, and after Volkswagen bought the company in the ‘90s, it started to pursue its new owner to re-create the former flagship model. That eventually happened, and in 2001, a new Superb appeared in Škoda’s lineup. Starting with the model’s second generation, the automaker produced the car in two shapes: hatchback-sedan and station wagon. The latter was traditionally named Combi by the Czech automaker. Fast-forward to 2023, and Škoda introduced the fourth generation of the Superb and the third generation of the station wagon version. While the Superb was mostly considered a mid-size vehicle, somehow, it breached into the large-family vehicle segment. Škoda looked like it didn’t really care about traditional standards. It did the vehicles in its own way and won. The station wagon of the 2024 model year Superb shared its front fascia with its sedan sibling, sporting angular-shaped headlights swept-back on the sides and two LED blocks for the high and low beams. These were underlined by bi-color LED stripes that served as daytime running lights and blinkers. An octagonal grille dominated the car’s front with its chromed vertical slats and featured a pinch on its upper side in the middle. From its profile, the Superb Combi unveiled its massive side panels that continued after the rear doors. Its long roofline ended with a tilted-forward tailgate adorned at its upper side by a roof spoiler. Like its predecessor, the 2024 Superb Combi featured a vast interior space. At the front of the cabin, customers were greeted by a minimalist-looking dashboard with an instrument cluster filled with a ten-inch display that showed the much-needed data for the driver. In addition, Škoda installed a 13” touchscreen placed atop the center stack in a free-floating position for the infotainment system. Underneath it, the automaker installed three digital dials that included small displays with a haptic feedback feature. As a result, all of them could control various functions depending on how they were rotated, swiped, or touched. On the center console, the automaker placed the gear selector and a few storage spaces. But the main reason why customers bought the station wagon version of the Superb was its cavernous trunk, which, with the rear seats folded down, provided up to 1,920 liters (67.8 cu-ft) of space. Under the hood of the third generation of the Škoda Superb Combi, the automaker installed a wide choice of engines that included a mild-hybrid, a plug-in hybrid, three gasoline powerplants, and two turbo-diesel units. All versions were paired with DSG automatic (dual-clutch) transmissions, and the most potent versions were fitted with traction on all corners.",SKODA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Superb"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""mid-size to large-family"",  ""overall-design"": [""angular-shaped headlights"", ""minimalist-looking dashboard"", ""vast interior space""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""octagonal"", ""chromed vertical slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angular-shaped"", ""swept-back"", ""LED blocks"", ""bi-color LED stripes""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""massive side panels"", ""rear doors""],    ""roof"": [""long roofline"", ""tilted-forward tailgate"", ""roof spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": [],    ""interior"": [""minimalist-looking dashboard"", ""ten-inch display"", ""13” touchscreen"", ""free-floating position"", ""cavernous trunk""]  }}```"
SKODA Scala,"The Czech automaker Skoda introduced a facelifted version of its compact-sized hatchback Scala in 2023 and added more features and amenities to the vehicle. As a result, the car became more attractive not just for regular customers but also for fleets. The Scala was the automaker's answer for the growing number of hatchbacks on the market offered by Renault, Ford, Opel, Peugeot, and Citroen. The vehicle was produced on the same MQB-A0 platform shared with its crossover sibling Kamiq and the exterior dimensions placed it between the small-sized and the compact-sized classes. While that didn't change too much, the car's design was improved, and the available number of options grew significantly. At the front, the most significant change was noticed in the headlights, which were available with the Matrix-LED technology. These kinds of LEDs were previously available only on Skoda's more luxurious sibling Audi. Furthermore, even the base trim level benefited from LED technology for the headlights. The vehicle's overall design kept the same specific cubist design language of the Czech automaker. Still, the main grille was improved, featuring seven vertical slats flanking the center-mounted radar for advanced safety systems. Skoda also redesigned the front lower bumper area with an enlarged lower grille flanked on the sides by two oblique slats, which delimited the side scoops. By using a diamond-style mesh design for that area, the vehicle looked not just sportier but also fresh and attractive to younger generations. Starting from the second trim level, the Scala boasted a pair of LED fog lamps, which were mounted in an upper protected area. From its profile, the sculptured door panels and rear fenders were mainly similar to those from the 2019 model year. At the back, the base model featured standard LED taillights, while the automaker offered an option for dynamic LEDs for the turn signals. Another important improvement for the 2023 model year was noticed inside the vehicle. Besides the complete 8-inch digital instrument cluster and the 8.5"" touchscreen for the infotainment system, the Scala had an option for suede upholstery and man-made leather seats. Moreover, customers could choose between six distinct interiors, depending on the trim level and options. Even though the vehicle's wheelbase was not significant, it offered plenty of room for the front occupants. At the same time, those seated in the back had enough legroom at their disposal. The rear split-folding bench could increase the trunk size. Under the hood, the Scala came fitted with a choice of engines ranging between 95 PS and 150 PS (94 HP – 148 HP) paired with five or six-speed manuals or seven-speed automatics (dual-clutch). Skoda also offered three options for the springs and shock settings. Besides the standard version, customers could get a rough suspension that provided 15 mm (0.6-inch) higher ground clearance, or a sportier, lowered by 10 mm (0.4-inch), stiffer one.",SKODA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Skoda Scala"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""cubist design language"", ""attractive"", ""sporty"", ""fresh"", ""sculptured""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""improved"", ""featuring seven vertical slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""Matrix-LED technology"", ""available with LED technology"", ""base trim level benefited from LED technology""],    ""bumper"": [""redesigned front lower bumper area"", ""enlarged lower grille"", ""diamond-style mesh design"", ""sportier look""],    ""wheel"": [""standard wheelbase"", ""plenty of room for front occupants""],    ""doors"": [""sculptured door panels""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [],    ""interior"": [""8-inch digital instrument cluster"", ""8.5\"" touchscreen for infotainment system"", ""option for suede upholstery"", ""man-made leather seats"", ""six distinct interiors""],    ""engine"": [""choice of engines ranging between 95 PS and 150 PS"", ""paired with five or six-speed manuals or seven-speed automatics"", ""offered three options for the springs and shock settings""]  }}```"
SKODA Kamiq,"In the summer of 2023, the Czech automaker Skoda introduced the refreshed version of its crossover Kamiq vehicle. The improved model brought significant updates to the car's exterior and interior. It also brought new, attractive drivetrain solutions. Sharing its MQB-A0 platform with its compact-sized hatchback sibling Scala, the Kamiq was introduced on the market in 2019. It was the smallest and most successful Skoda SUV/crossover vehicle, with over 300,000 units sold. Besides its attractive price, the Kamiq was welcomed by customers also due to what it had to offer for daily situations, such as fuel-efficient engines, a comfortable interior, and a large enough trunk for a family of four. But, despite its crossover look, it was exclusively available with a front-wheel-drive platform. For the refreshed version, Skoda installed a new grille up front, featuring vertical slats with chromed details to emphasize the car's importance in the automaker's lineup. The base trim level came with standard LED headlights, while the upper trim levels were available with Matrix-LED technology, previously reserved only for premium and expensive cars. But the Kamiq was none of these. It was just a simple, humble, jacked-up hatchback that played well in the family section. But that didn't keep Skoda on the side when it decided to improve the car's look. So, at the lower side of the front bumper, the car got a hexagonal mesh grille flanked on the sides by a pair of scoops. In addition, the automaker offered the option for LED fog lamps. The Kamiq featured sculptured door panels adorned with an ascending line that emerged from the lower side of the front doors to the rear quarter panels. Behind the rear doors, the raked-forward C-pillars got an angular shape on their lower side, emphasizing Skoda's cubist styling. Skoda adorned the back of the vehicle with corner-mounted taillights extended on the tailgate. Depending on the trim level and options, these LED lights were either stationary or with dynamic blinkers. Inside, Skoda's engineers worked hard, and the carmaker's team found a solution to provide the vehicle with up to six levels of interiors. The Kamiq featured cloth upholstery for the lower grades, while the upper ones could've been ordered with suede or man-made leather with hand-stitched details. Thanks to the taller greenhouse than in the Scala, the Kamiq could provide more headroom for passengers. Still, the legroom for those seated on the split-folding bench in the rear could have been better. It was just enough, especially for kids or teenagers. On the dashboard, the automaker installed an 8-inch display fronting the driver. In addition, an 8.5” touchscreen for the infotainment unit sat above the center stack. Skoda used only gasoline engines for the Kamiq ranging between 73 HP (75 PS) and 144 HP (150 PS) and paired with five or six-speed manuals or a seven-speed, dual-clutch, automatic gearbox. The Czech automaker also modified the vehicle's chassis and offered customers the option for a higher ground clearance for rough roads or a lower and stiffer one for those looking for a sportier look.",SKODA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Kamiq"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""attractive"", ""crossover"", ""humble"", ""family-friendly""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""taller""],    ""grille"": [""new"", ""hexagonal"", ""chromed"", ""vertical""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""Matrix-LED"", ""standard""],    ""bumper"": [""hexagonal mesh"", ""sculptured""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured"", ""ascending line""],    ""roof"": [""taller""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SKODA Kodiaq,"After selling almost 900,000 units from Kodiaq’s first generation in seven years, Skoda introduced the second generation of this nameplate in the Fall of 2023, promising smarter technologies and features. When the first generation of the Kodiaq broke covers in 2016, it stirred the European SUV market. Later, the vehicle reached other continents and was sold in 60 countries. The Czech brand built it on the same MQB A2 platform shared with the Volkswagen Tiguan Allspace or the Audi Q3, to name just two of its siblings. But thanks to its low price compared to the segment’s average, it gained popularity among those looking for a seven-seat vehicle able to go beyond paved roads and even do some light off-road on their way to camping sites or biking trails. The second generation followed the cubist design language of the brand, although much more refined. At the front, the hexagonal grille with 13 vertical chromed slats was available with an optional light strip that ran above it. As a result, combined with the LED daytime running lights of the headlamps, it created a light signature, offering an upscale look for the vehicle. The angular headlights and fog lamps were separated by a strip, which was part of the tall bumper. On the lower side, in the apron, the automaker placed a secondary grille adorned by a hexagonal mesh and flanked by vertical vents. From its profile, the Kodiaq retained the same distinctive elements as its predecessor, featuring an ascending waistline ending into a raked-forward D-pillar at the rear side. Unlike the first generation of this mid--sized SUV, both the B- and the C-pillars were darkened to create the image of larger windows. With its raked-forward tailgate and the roof spoiler mounted at its top, the Kodiaq offered its customers a dynamic look. Inside, Skoda made a clean design, uncluttered by too many buttons, but without being called a minimalist one either. The 13-inch touchscreen of the infotainment system stood atop the center stack in a free-floating position. Skoda adopted a new design for the HVAC system, with three rotary dials that featured 13-mm (0.5”) screens that showed various functions made by each dial. It was a combination of digital and analog made right. Fronting the driver was a 10-inch digital instrument cluster, fitted as standard for the entire range. Thanks to the longer wheelbase and bodywork, the seven-seat vehicle provided more room than its predecessor. As a result, even the two passengers seated in the third row had 920-millimeter (36.2”) of headroom, which was enough even for full-grown adults. Under the hood, Skoda installed a choice of gasoline, diesel, and plug-in hybrid drivetrains with either front- or all-wheel-drive systems. Still, the most powerful versions were fitted as standard with AWD. The 2023 Kodiaq iV (PHEV) provided 100 km (62 miles) of pure electric range, which was enough for the daily commute, and combined with the gasoline engine, it produced 204 PS (201 HP). The Kodiaq came fitted as standard with a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox for all grades.",SKODA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Kodiaq"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""mid-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""cubist"", ""refined"", ""dynamic"", ""upscale"", ""clean""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked-forward""],    ""grille"": [""hexagonal"", ""chromed"", ""vertical""],    ""hood"": [""tall""],    ""headlights"": [""angular"", ""LED"", ""separated""],    ""bumper"": [""tall"", ""angular""],    ""wheel"": [""longer wheelbase""],    ""doors"": [""clean design""],    ""roof"": [""raked-forward"", ""spoiler mounted""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": [""plug-in hybrid""]  }}```"
SKODA Karoq,"Skoda refreshed the Karoq lineup in 2021, adding more appeal to one of its best-selling SUVs. Being part of the Volkswagen Group, the Czech carmaker had to update its products after four years since their launches on the market. Despite the pandemic situation of the 2020s, it managed to comply with that demand. Maybe they could've done a better job, but still, it ticked enough boxes to qualify as an upgraded version. Skoda slightly reshaped the front fascia on the exterior, adding a thicker rim to the updated wide, hexagonal grille and installing a new set of slimmer headlights. Its new bumper featured a reshaped version of the older one, including a lower, narrow air intake. At the back, the carmaker placed a new set of taillights that followed the same shape as the previous ones but had a sharper look. In addition, the rear apron was extended downwards and, combined with the underbody shield, decreased the aerodynamic drag to a 0.30 coefficient. The 2021 Karoq was available in three trim levels: Active, Ambition, and Style. Moreover, they could have been enhanced with the Sportline package, which added a few details to make the car looks more aggressive. Inside, the carmaker added an Eco Pack option that included a new upholstery made out of recycled and vegan materials. In addition, there was a new decorative pack for the doors, which added softer materials. Skoda was often criticized for its hard-plastic door panels, especially less-expensive versions. Under the hood, the carmaker installed a choice of five engines ranging between 110 PS (108 hp) and 190 PS (187 hp) paired with either a six-speed manual or a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox.",SKODA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Karoq"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""appealing"", ""upgraded"", ""slimmer"", ""sharper""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wide"", ""hexagonal"", ""thicker""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""slimmer""],    ""bumper"": [""reshaped"", ""lower"", ""narrow""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""recycled"", ""vegan"", ""decorative"", ""softer""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SKODA Fabia,"Skoda introduced the fourth generation of its small-segment contender, Fabia, in 2021, and its features outrun many compact and mid-size vehicles. When Volkswagen bought the Czech carmaker, Skoda, its intention was to make it a budget company, which relied on its sales figures rather than in profit per unit. It helped it with technology and many other improvements, but in the end, it was about the Czech workers' stubbornness to build the car properly and make them one of the most reliable in the Volkswagen Group. The Fabia came on the market in 1999, and it was more or less a Volkswagen Polo with different bodywork. In 2021, the Fabia received the MQB-A0 platform used by Audi A1, Volkswagen Polo, and SEAT Ibiza, to name just a few. The exterior was still dominated by sharp angles and straight lines, resembling the Czech Cubism design concept. Its wide grille with vertical slats and chromed surrounding matched the look of its bigger brothers Scala, Octavia, and Superb. Its front bumper sported a wide grille at the bottom that hosted the side-mounted fog lights. From its sides, the design team made some sculptured areas on the lower side of the doors to channel the air and prevent turbulence near the bodywork. Its 0.28 aerodynamic coefficient confirmed that the engineers' efforts were not in vain. Inside, Skoda offered one of the roomiest interiors in the segment to that date. The carmaker provided an option for a 10.25"" digital instrument cluster and a 9.2"" infotainment system, depending on the trim level. Its wheelbase allowed enough room for up to five passengers and a 380 liter (13.4 cu-ft) of trunk space. An intelligent option was the umbrella incorporated into the front driver's door. Under the hood, Skoda installed a five-engine choice ranged between 65 hp and 150 hp.",SKODA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Fabia"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""sharp angles"", ""straight lines"", ""Czech Cubism design""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wide"", ""vertical slats"", ""chromed surrounding""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""side-mounted fog lights""],    ""bumper"": [""wide grille at the bottom""],    ""wheel"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""doors"": [""sculptured areas on the lower side""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SKODA Octavia Scout,"The Czech brand introduced the Octavia Scout in 2020, along with the rest of the Octavia range in a completely online event due to the world pandemic situation. The fourth generation of the Octavia offered more interior room and a new image. The car was built on the MQB Evo platform, which allowed a better integration for the mild-hybrid and hybrid versions. The Scout trim level was, just like its predecessors, a heightened and rugged version for the regular Octavia station-wagon. The new model featured a broader and shorter grille at the front. The designers chose the cubism style for the Octavia, and it was translated on the Scout version as well. Both bumpers and the side-sills were fitted with black plastic trims to protect the underbody from chips. A fake silver plastic shield enhanced the look of the front bumper. The black plastic molds on the wheel-arches were already a typical design cue of the Octavia Scout and found their way onto the 2020 model. The interior of the car was the same as the rest of the Octavia range. The interior design was specific for the trim level, with a mix of wood and green trims around the dashboard and the door panels. A 10” infotainment touch-screen display found its way on top of the center stack, in a free-floating design. Like its predecessors, the 2020 Octavia Scout offered more comfort due to the heated steering wheel and seats. Under the hood, Skoda installed a choice of turbocharged diesel or gasoline engine. The big news was about the traction system. For the first time, the Scout version was available as a 2WD only, for specific engines.",SKODA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Octavia Scout"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""broader and shorter"",  ""overall-design"": [""cubism style"", ""rugged"", ""heightened"", ""free-floating design""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broader"", ""shorter""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""black plastic trims"", ""fake silver plastic shield""],    ""wheel"": [""black plastic molds on wheel-arches""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SKODA Octavia Combi,"The Czech automaker Skoda introduced the fourth sequel of its most successful model, Octavia, in 2019, and like the previous generations, it offered it with a choice of two bodyworks: a hatchback and a station wagon. Skoda used the same MQB base as the Volkswagen Golf, Audi A3, and Seat Leon when it made the fourth generation of the Octavia. Still, the vehicle’s shape and the wheelbase were adjusted according to the automaker’s needs. But, unlike its siblings, Skoda insisted on keeping some of its clever solutions, such as the integrated umbrella in the driver’s door or the ice-scraper attached inside the fuel flap. The Czech automaker followed the same cubist design language specific to the brand. As a result, the fourth generation of the Octavia Combi featured angular headlights with L-shaped daytime running lights inside them. Depending on the trims and options, there were three LED groups inside each headlamp. The main grille, placed above the bumper, featured a hexagonal shape and was surrounded by a chromed rim and a set of vertical dark slats for all grades. On the lower bumper, the automaker added a narrower air intake where customers could get the LED fog lamps that were standard or optional, depending on the engine or trim level. The Combi version featured a similar shape as its hatchback sibling up until the rear doors but featured an extended roof stretched to the end of the vehicle and ended with a raked-forward tailgate adorned by a roof spoiler on its top. Finally, the sharp LED taillights were split at the back between the quarter panels and the large tailgate. Skoda offered the Octavia with a wide range of options for the interior. While the base model featured cloth seats and basic instrumentation, the upper trim levels boasted Alcantara upholstery, aluminum pedals, and a floating-style touchscreen for the infotainment system atop the center stack. Furthermore, customers could get the car with a complete digital instrument cluster and, as a first for the Octavia, a head-up display. The front occupants could benefit from the heated and ventilated seats, which were on the options list, along with the heated steering wheel. In the back, the split-folding (60/40) bench seat could accommodate comfortably two passengers, but with enough room for a middle-seated one. The 640-liter (22.6 cu-ft) trunk with the rear seats up was the largest in the segment. Moreover, by folding down the rear bench seat, customers could expand the loading area up to 1,700 liters (60 cu-ft.). Under the hood, the fourth generation of the Octavia came fitted with a wide choice of engines ranging between 110 PS (108 hp) and 204 PS (201 hp) with front or all-wheel-drive systems. A six-speed manual gearbox was standard on lower spec versions, while the upper levels got a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) transmission.",SKODA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Octavia"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""Mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""Cubist design language"", ""Angular headlights"", ""Sharp LED taillights"", ""Wide range of interior options""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""Hexagonal shape"", ""Chromed rim"", ""Vertical dark slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""L-shaped daytime running lights"", ""Three LED groups""],    ""bumper"": [""Narrower air intake""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""Integrated umbrella"", ""Ice-scraper attached inside the fuel flap""],    ""roof"": [""Extended and raked-forward"", ""Roof spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SKODA Citigo,"The electric-car frenzy made the Czech car-manufacturer to build the 2019 Citigo small-car model as a full-electric model with a big autonomy, enough to roam around town. The need for electric vehicles was high and car-manufacturers around the world started to offer various vehicles. The Volkswagen Group offered a small electric vehicle lineup with three badges: Seat Me, Volkswagen UP!, and Skoda Citigo iV. Basically, the three vehicles shared the same assembly line, and it was only a badge-engineering. In the end, it was all about styling and pricing. The Skoda Citigo iV was the most affordable of all three models and it has its own style and specific design to attract its customers. Since it didn't have an internal combustion engine under the hood, it didn't need an actual grille. The Skoda's designers chose to install the 21 vertical bars on a frame to mimic a grille. That pattern was also used for other cars in the lineup. The Citigo iV was fitted as standard with 14"" steel wheels, on the Ambition trim level. For the Style trim level, 16"" light-alloy wheels were offered as standard. Inside, the car was fitted with minimum requirements for a car that goes around town for the daily commute. There were some specific options such as infotainment system, parking sensors, insulated windows, or heated front seats. For the drivetrain, the Citigo iV featured an electric motor on the front and a battery in the floor. It consisted of a total of 186 cells and allowed a range of a maximum of 265 km (160 miles). It had the ability to be driven as a single pedal drive.",SKODA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Citigo"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""electric"", ""stylish"", ""affordable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sleek""],    ""grille"": [""virtual"", ""patterned""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""14-inch steel"", ""16-inch light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SKODA Octavia,"In 2019, Skoda introduced a brand-new generation, the fourth, for its successful model Octavia, and made it with either a hatchback or a station wagon shape. The fourth generation of this unusually long compact-sized hatchback for the European market shared its underpinnings with the Volkswagen Golf and the Audi A3, to name just a few. Its MQB platform proved successful despite its drawbacks when it came to the base versions of the Octavia, which featured a torsion beam in the back instead of independent suspensions for the entire range like other Octavia generations. Still, the car was successful thanks to its fuel-efficient engines, bold design, and clever solutions that included an umbrella inside the driver’s door and an ice-scraper housed by the fuel door. Following the same brand’s cubist design language, the fourth generation of the Octavia boasted angular-shaped headlights with L-shaped daytime running lights inside them. There were two of these inside each headlamp, trying to create an aggressive look. One of the most important changes in the car’s design language was the grille, which gained a wide hexagonal shape surrounded by a chromed trim and vertical dark slats for all grades. Underneath it, the bumper boasted a lower, narrower grille that could accommodate the LED fog lamps, offered as an option or fitted as standard, depending on the engine version. From its profile, the Octavia had an ascending waistline emphasized by the sculptured door panels. Another upgrade compared to its predecessor was the rear doors’ design, which featured a bump towards their ending area, creating an angular shape for the windows. In the back, despite the car’s sedan look, it featured a tailgate with a raked forward window. Finally, at the back, the sharp LED taillights were split between the quarter panels and the tailgate. Skoda offered the Octavia with a wide range of options for the interior. While the base model featured cloth seats and basic instrumentation, the upper trim levels boasted Alcantara upholstery, aluminum pedals, and a floating-style touchscreen for the infotainment system placed atop the center stack. Furthermore, customers could get the car with a complete digital instrument cluster and, as a first for the Octavia, a head-up display. The front occupants could benefit from the heated and ventilated seats, which were on the options list, along with the heated steering wheel. In the back, the split-folding (60/40) bench seat could accommodate comfortably two passengers, but with enough room for a middle-seated one. For the safety package, Skoda offered customers the option to get the car with traffic sign recognition, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, and automatic emergency braking system. Under the hood, the fourth generation of the Octavia came fitted with a wide choice of engines ranging between 110 PS (108 hp) and 204 PS (201 hp) with front or all-wheel-drive systems.

SKODA Octavia Combi RS,"The Czech carmaker Skoda just turned its sportiest model towards the electricity avenue with the fourth generation of its performance model, the Octavia vRS. They even called it iV, instead of a simple 4th or IV. And it is not just a hybrid, it is a plug-in hybrid. It is the kind of vehicle that might steer petrolheads towards electric mobility. The first three generations of the Octavia vRS were mostly gasoline turbocharged engines and it was a cheaper alternative for hot-hatches, but packed into a more practical bodywork. Now it is not that cheap anymore, but it is more practical. Under the hood, Skoda installed a 1.4-liter TSI engine that offers 150 hp. On top of that, an electric motor of 85 kW helps things up obtaining a total combined output of 245 hp and 400 Nm (295 lb-ft) of torque. Transmission is on the front wheels only via a 6-speed DSG (double-clutch) gearbox. But the performance numbers are not so impressive. Actually, since it is a plug-in hybrid and it is heavier than the previous generation, it is much slower. The 0-100 kph (0-62 mph) sprint is obtained now in 7.3 seconds, compared with 6.8 seconds for the former generation. The top speed now is 225 kph (140 mph), which is 25 kph (15.5 mph) slower than the Octavia vRS from the 3rd generation. But it is more fuel-efficient. If that will count for a petrolhead.",SKODA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Octavia vRS iV"",  ""year"": ""4th generation"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""practical""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""sporty""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""practical""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SKODA Fabia Combi,"Skoda was one of the few competitors in Europe that offered a station wagon for its small-class segment comptitor, the Fabia, and in 2018 it introduced a facelift for it. Volkswagen was keen to dominate the small-class segment station-wagons in Europe, and its main competitors were the Renault Clio Estate and the cheaper Dacia Logan MCV. Yet, the Czech brand Skoda pulled another version of its renowned Fabia Combi. The car was based on the same PQ26 platform shared with the Audi A1, the SEAT Ibiza, and the Volkswagen Polo. Skoda's designers followed the same lines for the Combi as for its regular hatchback, although there were some differences from its profile. Behind the rear doors, the carmaker added an extended quarter panel and a set of side windows next to the trunk area. Finally, at the back, the raked-forward tailgate incorporated a windscreen wiper and a small roof spoiler on top. Inside, the cubist exterior was replaced by a minimalist trend, especially on the base trim levels. But the options list was long, and depending on the trim level, the car could have been fitted with an infotainment unit and a 6.5"" display on the center stack. The Fabia Combi was renowned for its trunk space, and this version didn't disappoint its customers with its 330 liters (11.6 cu-ft) of space, which could have been extended up to 1,150 liters (40.6 cu-ft) by folding down the rear bench. Under the hood, there was only one engine available but offered with or without a turbocharger. The standard transmission was a 5-speed manual for the versions under 100 hp and a 6-speed manual for the 110 hp version. A 7-speed DSG (dual-clutch) automatic transmission was offered for the latter.",SKODA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Skoda Fabia Combi"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""Small-class station-wagon"",  ""overall-design"": [""Cubist exterior"", ""Minimalist interior"", ""Extended quarter panel"", ""Raked-forward tailgate"", ""Roof spoiler""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""Small roof spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SKODA Octavia Combi 4x4,"Skoda launched a facelifted version for the Octavia's third generation to comply with the Euro6d emission standards and the 4x4 Combi version was also upgraded. Ever since the car's first generation was developed under Volkswagen's umbrella, the compact Czech vehicle was available with an all-wheel drive version. In 2012, when it launched the third generation of this nameplate, it did that again and kept it on the production line even after the facelift, which occurred in 2017. Unlike its Octavia Scout sibling, which was a crossover version, the regular Octavia 4x4 aimed at customers who needed the vehicle for snow-covered roads and didn't need higher ground clearance. The front of the car shared the front fascia with the regular station wagon version, with its unmistakable and polarizing split headlights system. Skoda claimed that the idea came from the cubist design trend that was envisioned by artists such as Josef Chochol, Pavel Janak, or Vladislav Hofman. Also flanked by the headlights was the main grille that was fitted with 14 vertical slats, and the radar for adaptive cruise control and other safety features took center stage. The extended roofline and the optional tinted rear side windows were part of the Combi (station wagon) package, and so were its new LED taillights with smoked lenses. Inside, The Czech carmaker introduced a new infotainment system with either a 6.5"" or a 9.2"" touchscreen on the center stack. The 2017 Octavia also featured improved active and passive safety systems, such as traffic sign recognition or City Emergency Brake, including Pedestrian Protection. Fortunately, the addition of the all-wheel drive system didn't affect the interior space, so the owners could enjoy the 610 liters (21.5 cu-ft) of trunk space with the rear seats up and 1,740 liters (61.4 cu-ft) with the rear bench folded down. The vehicle was fitted with a Haldex all-wheel drive system consisting of a multi-plate clutch mounted in front of the rear differential. Only the Octavia 4x4 benefitted from the nameplate's lineup's most powerful gasoline and turbo-diesel engines.",SKODA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Octavia"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""polarizing split headlights"", ""cubist design trend"", ""extended roofline"", ""LED taillights"", ""infotainment system""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""14 vertical slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""polarizing split system""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""extended""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SKODA Enyaq Coupe,"Skoda introduced a Coupe version for the Enyaq iV in 2022 and made a step further towards its complete electrification program. When BMW introduced the X6 SAC (Sports Activity Coupe) in 2007, it was unique on the market. In the beginning, customers were reluctant to that design. However, after the financial crisis ended, the market showed that the Bavarian carmaker was right when it offered it. Meanwhile, on the mass-market segment, there was no competitor present. Finally, after a few years, the French carmaker Renault introduced the Arkana, and it was successful. As part of the VW group, Skoda didn't dare to build something like that until 2022, when it unveiled the Enyaq Coupe. It was based on the same MEB electric platform used by its VW siblings, such as the ID.4. The SUV's aerodynamic profile with a drag coefficient of just 0.234 was among the best in class. That allowed the vehicle to travel up to 545 km (338.6 miles) between recharges. The most striking news about the car was the shape, which featured a sloped-down roofline, thus creating a sportier profile. At the back, the angular, curved tailgate line contrasted with the angular design of the taillights, showing a more muscular appearance. Inside the vehicle, the sport seats at the front contrasted with the rear split-folding bench could fit three passengers. One particular detail about the car was the standard panoramic glass roof, which enhanced the interior light. In addition, to show its concern about the environment, Skoda installed natural, sustainably processed, and recycled materials.",SKODA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Enyaq iV Coupe"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""aerodynamic"", ""sporty"", ""muscular"", ""environmentally conscious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angular""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""panoramic"", ""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SKODA Kushaq,"Skoda opened a factory in India in 2019 and started to build cars there to avoid the high custom taxes, and in 2021 it launched a market-specific model: the Kushaq. The name Kushaq derived from the Sanskrit word Kushak and meant emperor or king. Skoda tried to make the car a new segment champion, and steal the crown from the Hyundai Creta, its main competitor. It developed and produced in India, based on the MQB-A0-IN platform, derived from the MQB one used for more vehicles within the Volkswagen Group. It was shorter than the European Karoq and used a simple recipe: higher ground clearance, lots of standard features, good safety, and a price as low as possible. Kushaq's exterior left no doubts about its crossover roots. Its angular lines resembled the cubist trend followed by the Czech carmaker. At the front, the fat bumper featured a lower silver shield at the bottom. Depending on the trim level, Skoda installed LED headlights and standard LED taillights for the entire range. The large wheels and flared wheel-arches, with their black moldings, created an SUV stance. Inside, Skoda continued the cubist design theme with a minimalist dashboard design and a storage space on top of it. The infotainment unit, installed as a floating device above the center stack, enhanced the driving experience. It allowed Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. In the instrument cluster, the big dials for the speedometer and tachometer flanked an LCD. Skoda installed two bucket-seats at the front and a 60/40 split-folding bench in the back. Under the hood, the carmaker offered the Kushaq a choice of 1.0-liter and 1.5-liter turbocharged gasoline engines paired to a six-speed manual or a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) transmission. All versions featured front-wheel-drive systems.",SKODA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Kushaq"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""cubist"", ""angular"", ""SUV stance"", ""minimalist"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""angular""],    ""grille"": [""fat"", ""silver""],    ""hood"": [""short""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""angular""],    ""bumper"": [""fat"", ""lower silver shield""],    ""wheel"": [""large"", ""flared"", ""black moldings""],    ""doors"": [""simple""],    ""roof"": [""-""],    ""diffusor"": [""-""],    ""spoiler"": [""-""],    ""exhaust"": [""-""]  }}```"
SKODA Rapid,"The Skoda Rapid released in 2012 had a great impressive design, offered a roomy cabin and a great sized trunk, but the most important thing, the price-value ratio was excellent. Designed for people looking for comfort and practicality, the Rapid was a good choice with the massive 550 liter load area. The Rapid could have fitted into the small sedans segment, being bigger than a Fabia, but still smaller than the Skoda’s best selling Octavia. The engine options were two 1.2-liter gasoline engines developing 104 hp, a 1.4-liter gasoline producing 121 hp and a 1.6-liter diesel. While the engines were not as powerful, the Rapid was still fun to drive. The Rapid had a clean, nice looking interior and good quality materials. The seats were comfortable and the overall feeling was of roominess. Safety wise, the Rapid was equipped with ABS, ESP, tyre pressure monitoring, foglmaps, hill-hold control, front and side airbags, along with adjustable-height 3-point sagety belts. The Rapid was available in three trim levels: Active, Ambition and Elegance. Several interior color combinations for the dashboard and the door panels were available as Satin Black and Satin Black, Satin Black and Telluride Grey and Satin Black and Stone Beige. While the Rapid was not as exciting as the rivals in its class, it was definitely the cheapest to afford with quite great features.",SKODA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Skoda Rapid"",  ""year"": ""2012"",  ""size"": ""roomy, spacious, massive 550 liter trunk"",  ""overall-design"": [""impressive"", ""practical"", ""comfortable"", ""clean"", ""nice-looking""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SKODA Slavia,"Skoda opened its factory in India and began producing cars in March 2021, with the Kushaq as the first model. Then, in November same year, it launched the Slavia. While the Kushaq was a crossover, the Slavia aimed at lower prices. Thanks to its lower price, the sedan aimed at the masses rather than its taller and older brother. Skoda built it on a specific version of the MQB-A0 platform, which received the -IN mark at the end, meaning it was made in and for the Indian market. Following the same design language as its European siblings, the Slavia featured angular lines and clear-cut headlights without too many curved lines at the front fascia. A chromed rim surrounded the grille that sported black, vertical slats. From its sides, its tall door panels followed an ascending beltline, while the sloped roofline emerged to the trunk area. At the back, the designers place a pair of slim LED lights on the trunk's lid, complementing the C-shaped taillights. The interior revealed a minimalist, cubist design language with a 7"" infotainment screen that sat atop the center stack. A 10"" unit was available as an option. For the base trim levels, the driver benefited from analog dials, while the top trim level, named Style, received an 8"" TFT instrument cluster. Depending on the trim level and options, the carmaker delivered the Slavia with a six-speed automatic transmission and paddle-shifters behind the two-spoke steering wheel. Under the hood, Skoda offered a choice of two gasoline engines: a 1.0-liter inline-three and an inline-four with 1.5-liter displacement, both units being turbocharged. For the drivetrain, up front, the Slavia featured McPherson struts while the rear benefited from a twisting-arm semi-independent suspension.",SKODA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Slavia"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""angular lines"", ""clear-cut headlights"", ""minimalist cubist interior""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""clear-cut""],    ""grille"": [""chromed rim"", ""black vertical slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""clear-cut"", ""slim LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""tall panels"", ""ascending beltline""],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SKODA Rapid Spaceback,"Skoda introduced the Rapid lineup in 2012 as a compact-segment vehicle, filling the space between the small-sized Fabia and the mid-sized Octavia. When the Czech carmaker introduced the Octavia range in 1996, it was the most extended compact-class vehicle on the European market. By 2012, it was already in the mid-size segment, and there was an empty slot which Rapid filled it. The car was available in two body shapes: a sedan and a hatchback named Spaceback. Its design resembled the Czech cubist trend, and the name evoked a sporty coupe from the mid-'80s. The horizontal angular-shaped headlights were narrow compared to the front fascia's height and produced a sporty image. The grille with 19 black vertical slats was already a signature feature for the carmaker, and it was similar to the rest of the Skoda range. Its hatchback profile with a raked-forward tailgate showcased a third side window behind the rear doors. Inside, the Rapid featured a minimalist design for the base trim levels, with a clean dashboard and a flat front fascia for the air vents. Its rounded instrument panel was carried over from the Fabia lineup and sported two large dials and an LCD between them for the onboard computer. Skoda installed an infotainment system with a 5"" touch-screen on the center stack for the upper trim levels. Despite being shorter than its sedan sibling, the Rapid Spaceback provided more legroom for the rear passengers. Its split-folding rear bench extended the trunk size when folded from a regular 550 liters (19.4 cu-ft) to 1,490 liters (52.6 cu-ft). Under the hood, the carmaker offered a choice of gasoline and turbo-diesel engines ranging between 86 hp and 122 hp.",SKODA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Rapid"",  ""year"": ""2012"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""cubist"", ""sporty"", ""minimalist"", ""angular"", ""horizontal""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""angular"", ""slanted""],    ""grille"": [""black"", ""vertical""],    ""hood"": [""flat""],    ""headlights"": [""narrow"", ""horizontal"", ""angular""],    ""bumper"": [""sporty""],    ""wheel"": [""raked-forward""],    ""doors"": [""hatchback"", ""rear"", ""split-folding""],    ""roof"": [""hatchback"", ""raked-forward""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SKODA Enyaq,"Somebody from the Czech car-company must have been a huge fan of the Irish singer Enya if it gave her name to the very first electric vehicle from Skoda: the Enyaq. Who can say where the road goes for the electric vehicles? Only time could tell that but Skoda took advantage of the MEB electric platform from the Volkswagen Group and built an SUV that relies exclusively on electricity to move. It was revealed in September 2020 in an online event due to the European pandemic situation. The design team took its inspiration from the Skoda Kodiaq, the big SUV that failed to convince enough people to buy it. The angular shape of the car was in the cubism trend with sharp-looking headlights, and a big, fake, grille. On the lower apron, the side-scoops might be used to help to cool the brakes and the lower grille might be used to cool the floor-mounted batteries. From the side, the big 21” light-alloy wheels are making a difference in that segment. Inside, the Enyaq featured augmented reality for the head-up display and two digital displays: one for the instrument cluster and another one, as a floating device, for the infotainment system. The minimalist design looked fresh, airy, and uncluttered by too many buttons. For the seats, Skoda chose some from the already existing models in the company stores, with dual color for the upholstery. Due to its big wheelbase and the flat floor, the seats in the back promised to offer enough room for up to three passengers. There was no center tunnel for the transmission. The Enyaq was offered with three battery sizes and five powertrain options, with either rear- or all-wheel-drive. Its range was between 340 km (211 miles) and 510 km (317 miles).",SKODA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Enyaq"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""angular"", ""cubism-inspired"", ""minimalist"", ""airy"", ""uncluttered""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""big"", ""fake""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""sharp-looking""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""big 21” light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SMART forfour,"A small step for mini lovers, a big step for the Smart ForFour. Smart has made a few changes from the original 2004 Smart ForFour, which wasn't a big success, to the EQ ForFour. The EQ ForFour is very much a city/town car created to reduce CO2 emissions, especially in urban areas. The transition to pure electric power has been straightforward for Smart. They replaced the engine and the fuel tank with an electrical engine, which is impressively done right, practicality being unaffected by the switch to battery power. The exterior is Designed and built in collaboration with its rival Renault Twingo, the new Renault Twingo same four doors supermini city car. A facelift for 2020 resulted in mostly visual changes, adding a smoother bonnet, larger grille, new lights, and different wheel designs. From the front, the futuristic towncar design is completed by its square Full-LED headlamps with main & dipped beam, integral indicator & daytime running lights, more robust shoulder line,, and larger honeycomb grille. The interior is upgraded with a new 'floating' touchscreen infotainment system lifted from the Renault Twingo, dominating the dashboard on top-spec models. Also, it has newly designed cupholders and a place for smartphones, giving a high-quality feeling. The older version and discontinued petrol-powered Smart ForFour had a dash-mounted rev counter. The new EQ version has an easy-to-read power and charge dial. For more fun, Smart added the option for Android Auto, but unfortunately, it has no Apple CarPlay. The entry-level Pure model version is well equipped with a 3.5-inch color instrument panel display, LED daytime running lights, climate control, USB and aux connections, Bluetooth, cruise control with a speed limiter, stop-start and electric windows fitted as standard. Some features are also available such as a panoramic roof and heated seats. For a town car, the navigation system is essential to be good, so the smart has a TomTom-based satnav. In terms of practicality, the rear seats are best to be used by children, being a bit too tight for adults. Performance is quite good if considering the Smart EQ ForFour is a four-seat full-electric city car. It’s agile around town. It has 82 horsepower and a healthy 160 Nm while offering zero emissions, smooth power delivery, and a range of up to 99 miles from a single full charge, which is pretty decent. The new ForFour has nothing to deal with the previous model. The new model of ForFour has Crosswind Assist (fitted as standard) moderates braking when the car encounters a strong gust of wind, which is a significant improvement. Other features, including a forward collision warning and lane-keeping assist, are also available. Safety also improved, the ForFour scored four stars overall, with the new high-strength steel chassis also proving to be as strong and as safe as a Mercedes C-Class in frontal collisions, making it a good choice for those who want small towncar with zero emissions.",SMART,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Smart EQ ForFour"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""futuristic"", ""practical"", ""city-friendly"", ""visual"", ""electric""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sleek"", ""modern""],    ""grille"": [""larger"", ""honeycomb""],    ""hood"": [""smoother""],    ""headlights"": [""Full-LED"", ""square"", ""futuristic""],    ""bumper"": [""modern""],    ""wheel"": [""different design""],    ""doors"": [""four"", ""city-friendly""],    ""roof"": [""panoramic""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SMART fortwo,"In 2019, Mercedes-Benz re-badged the brand Smart, which was now focused on electric vehicles, and thus created the smart-EQ, which was available as a two-door coupe or a convertible. Mercedes-Benz worked with the French automaker Renault when it made the third generation of the smart fortwo, launched in 2014. Fast forward three years, and the electric versions of this city car got rebranded and received the EQ badge behind the brand’s name, following the same system introduced by the three-pointed star automaker for its electric vehicles. Only a year later, in the autumn of 2019, the new smart-EQ received a facelift for both its fortwo coupe and fortwo cabriolet versions. In addition, the automaker pulled the plug on the ICE versions for the entire range, including the fourfour. Thus, the brand returned to its original idea of an all-electric vehicle made for the urban environment. At the front, the car sported a smiling-shaped lower grille flanked on the sides by scoops and the optional fog lamps. In addition, the headlights got a slight reshape and integrated daytime running lights, which surrounded the inner sides of the headlamps. Starting with the 2019 fortwo, the car also got LED lights that improved the nighttime driving experience and lowered the energy consumption compared to halogen or Xenon bulbs. From its profile, the fortwo featured a steep windshield and a short roof. Behind the thick B-pillars, the automaker installed the vertical tailgate, adorned on its upper side by plastic trims and a roof spoiler. The cabin was refreshed compared to the 2016 model and featured tall seatbacks with integrated headrests. Fronting the driver was a classic smart instrument cluster with a TFT display surrounded by an analog dial for the speedometer. Mercedes-Benz added a new infotainment unit on the center stack, supporting Bluetooth connectivity. The standard version came well-equipped and included AC and heated seats. Underneath it, on the center console, the automaker placed the gear selector, two cup holders, and a tiny drawer on the side for some coins or headphones. Behind the tiny cabin was a briefcase-sized trunk placed above the rear axle and the electric motor. Mercedes-Benz installed a 60 kW (80 HP) behind the car, under the trunk’s floor. Thanks to its instant torque of 160 Nm (118 lb-ft.), the car could accelerate quickly to keep pace with other vehicles in urban traffic. Despite its small size, the car had a 17.6 kWh lithium-ion battery pack installed under the floor. Thanks to its light construction and small size, the smart EQ fortwo could rocket from 0 to 60 kph (45 MPH) in less than five seconds. In addition, the energy-efficient motor with regenerative braking could provide a range of 156 km (99 miles) on a single charge.",SMART,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""smart-EQ fortwo"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""electric"", ""urban"", ""compact"", ""modern"", ""efficient""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""steep""],    ""grille"": [""smiling-shaped"", ""lower""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""reshaped"", ""integrated"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""short""],    ""roof"": [""short""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SMART fortwo Cabrio,"Smart introduced a new electron-powered version of its well-known Fortwo product in 2019 and offered it in coupe and convertible shapes. The smart brand was born after a short marriage between the German giant Mercedes-Benz and the Swiss watchmaker Swatch. Right from the start, the idea was to develop an electric-only small-sized vehicle fit for cities. After a while, the German automaker said that it couldn’t be done and their partners should reconsider their position and accept, at least for a while, fuel-efficient tiny vehicles fueled by gasoline or diesel. After many negotiations, the marriage was dissolved in 1998, even before the first product could reach the market. Two decades later, in 2008, Mercedes-Benz produced in a limited edition an electric version of the tiny vehicle, and after that, the EV era began. But Swatch was no longer onboard. The 2019 model came with a new look and a daring proposal for the market. Instead of trying to be a jack-of-all-trades, it was just a city vehicle fit for two with a range that should be enough for the daily commute. It was stylish and could charge in about eight hours at a regular home outlet. Its front fascia featured organic-shaped headlights swept back on the sides and included LED daytime running lights. Moreover, the lower bumper featured a chicken-wire-style pattern for the grille and was flanked by a pair of round fog lamps. There was also a set of side scoops, but their main purpose was to look good. From its profile, the open-top smart featured a tilted windshield extended almost above the front seats. At the back, the wide B-pillar also served as a safety measure protecting the car’s occupants in the event of a roll-over accident. Behind it, the automaker offered customers to fold down the rear side of the roof, while the top panel could’ve been concealed under the trunk’s floor. The cabin was refreshed compared to the 2016 model and featured tall seatbacks with integrated headrests. Fronting the driver was a classic smart instrument cluster with a TFT display surrounded by an analog dial for the speedometer. Mercedes-Benz added a new infotainment unit on the center stack, supporting Bluetooth connectivity. The standard version came well-equipped and included AC and heated seats. Underneath it, on the center console, the automaker placed the gear selector, two cup holders, and a tiny drawer on the side for some coins or headphones. Behind the tiny cabin was a briefcase-sized trunk placed above the rear axle and the electric motor. A 60 kW (80 HP) motor powered this tiny vehicle for up to 159 kilometers (99 miles) on a single charge in ideal conditions. The car boasted a 4.8-second acceleration time from zero to 60 kph (45 MPH) and a top speed of 130 kph (81 MPH). Still, it was designed as a city vehicle and mostly for driving with the top down, so not in winter conditions too much.",SMART,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Fortwo"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""small-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""stylish"", ""electric"", ""city-fit"", ""compact"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""tilted"", ""extended""],    ""grille"": [""chicken-wire-style""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""organic-shaped"", ""swept-back"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""lower"", ""chicken-wire-style""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""open-top""],    ""roof"": [""foldable"", ""concealable""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SMART Electric Drive,"The German automaker SMART introduced an electric version of its smallest vehicle, the fortwo, in the autumn of 2016 at the Paris Motor Show and started sales in the same year in the U.S. and in Europe in 2017. Mercedes-Benz still owned the brand when it introduced the third generation of the tiny two-door vehicle. Only this time, it worked closely with Renault to share the development costs. In addition, it benefited from the French automaker's experience in electric vehicle construction, so the fortwo also got an electron-powered version. From the outside, the electric version of the fortwo featured the same shape as the internal-combustion-engined sibling with a very short front. Strangely, the automaker kept a mesh grille even though it didn't need that much cooling area. Moreover, the motor was in the back. The big bumper featured fog lights on its outer lower sides. From the side, as in the first SMART ForTwo generation, the safety cell featured a different color than the rest of the car's panels. Inside the car, there were two seats, as usual, but with plenty of room for the occupants. An unusual design for the dashboard showed a speedometer in front of the driver and two additional gauges on top of it in the middle. On the center stack, an optional infotainment touchscreen was installed. The small trunk space could have been extended by folding down the passenger seat seatback. Unlike its IAC brother, the electric-powered version received a 60 kW (80 hp) motor fed by a 17.6 kWh battery pack. That package was enough for the daily travels of most customers since the car could cover 99 miles (110 km) on a single charge. In addition, it could've been charged from zero to 100% in just a few hours from a regular, 7kWh wall-box.",SMART,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""fortwo"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""compact"", ""electric"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""short front""],    ""grille"": [""mesh""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""fog lights""],    ""bumper"": [""big"", ""fog lights""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""two seats"", ""roomy""],    ""roof"": [""safety cell with different color""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SMART 1,"Mercedes-Benz and Geely inked a deal where the German automaker made the design for the smart #1, and the Chinese car manufacturer developed the underpinnings for the revolutionary crossover vehicle. While it was not a revolution in terms of a product, it was one for the German brand. Prior to the #1, smart produced just the ForTwo and the FourFour models, either alone or in collaboration with Renault or Mitsubishi. So, the #1 was a completely new start; and it was electric. At the front, the Y-shaped headlights pointing toward the center of the front fascia were connected via a LED strip. On the lower side of the front panel, the automaker installed a broad grille with a grid-like pattern. This was flanked by two side scoops that channeled air toward the sides of the vehicle to enhance aerodynamics. From its profile, the car differed from the concept car unveiled in September 2021 since it featured regular front-hinged doors both front and rear. The prototype was unveiled with rear-hinged doors for the rear passengers. At the back, the tilted-forward tailgate resembled the second generation of the FourFour. Finally, the taillights echoed the shapes of the front headlights. Inside, the carmaker adopted a minimalist design with straight lines and curved surfaces. Atop the center stack, it mounted a 12.8-inch touchscreen for the infotainment system, while fronting the driver was a small 9.2'' LCD for the instrument panel, neatly integrated into the dashboard. Since smart was half-owned by Mercedes-Benz, it featured high-quality materials. The bolstered front seats could've been ordered with man-made leather. At the back, the bench was suitable for three passengers thanks to the flat floor. The trunk, on the other hand, was small-sized, offering just a mere 273 liters (9.6 cu-ft), and the frunk could hold an additional 15 liters (0.5 cu-ft) of storage. For the drivetrain, the automaker offered a single version at the start of the sales, with a 272 PS (268 hp) motor fed by a 66 kWh battery pack.",SMART,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""smart #1"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""small-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""electric"", ""minimalist"", ""modern"", ""aerodynamic"", ""high-quality""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""grid-like""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""Y-shaped"", ""LED"", ""connected""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""front-hinged"", ""rear-hinged (concept)""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SPYKER C8 Preliator,"After 2 years of absence from the shows, in 2016, Spyker unveiled its C8 Preliator at the Geneva Motor Show. The C8 reached its 3rd generation on the sports car market and was the successor of the C8 Aileron. For the ones who don’t know, the Spyker company came to life as an aircraft manufacturer, the reason why the C8 was an aircraft-inspired car. The company’s logo represented a wheel with a propeller. The new C8 came with an improved chassis and the supercharged V8 engine developed 525 hp. Many would’ve expected that a 2016 sports car would’ve been equipped with an automatic transmission, however, the C8 had a manual one. The interior was completely redesigned, using honeycomb stitches to match the grille’s model. The exterior paint was actually an aircraft color with a satin finish. The sports car’s air inlets were turbine-shaped and the rear lights were also inspired by planes, having the shape of an afterburner belonging to a fighter jet’s jet engine. The nameplate of “Preliator” came from Latin and stood for “warrior” – the company had gone through ups and downs and managed to succeed with only a small team of near 10 people. The Preliator was produced in 50 units only, and as they said, having an exclusive unique car meant that the chances to see another car like yours at the stop were almost 0.",SPYKER,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""C8 Preliator"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""sports car"",  ""overall-design"": [""aircraft-inspired"", ""exclusive"", ""satin finish"", ""turbine-shaped"", ""fighter jet-inspired""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""honeycomb-stitched""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""turbine-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SPYKER C8 Double 12 S,"In the early 2000s, Spyker decided to compete in the famous 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France, so it had to build a vehicle for that. The race organizers required manufacturers to produce at least 25 units of a vehicle to get the homologation number. Spyker couldn't rely on the regular C8, so it created a road-going monster named C8 Double 12 S, which was the street version of the C8 Double 12 R race car. Moreover, Spyker complained that since it was a small manufacturer, it couldn't provide 25 units, so that number was decreased to 15. The Dutch manufacturer used the same platform as the C8 but with an extended wheelbase, needed for the high-speed areas of the Mulsanne straight. Yet, the street-legal model was quite stylish, with a glass roof from the C8 Laviolette. Moreover, at the back of the sloped greenhouse, the carmaker added a modified, more extended deck to provide an additional area to increase the aerodynamic efficiency. But the carmaker didn't have to install the same scarce interior as in a race car. Thus, it fitted the cabin with a leather-wrapped interior complemented by aluminum trims. The four-spoke steering wheel and the polished metallic parts of the gear linkage were also used from other C8 models. The most intriguing part of the car was in the engine compartment. While the race-going version was fitted with an Audi-sourced 4.2-liter V8, the race car was equipped with a 4.0-liter BMW engine due to race regulations. That led to a more powerful 450 PS (444 hp) C8 Double 12 S than the racing model. But when the race organizers had to check the road-legal vehicle, they were presented with a BMW-powered example, which was the only one produced. The rest of the 14 units were fitted with the Audi engine.",SPYKER,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""C8 Double 12 S"",  ""year"": ""early 2000s"",  ""size"": ""extended wheelbase"",  ""overall-design"": [""stylish"", ""sloped greenhouse"", ""aerodynamic"", ""leather-wrapped interior"", ""polished metallic parts""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""extended""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""glass""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""modified, extended""],    ""exhaust"": [""powerful""]  }}```"
SPYKER C12 LaTurbie,"In 1922, the Dutch Hugo Hope Alexander von Pallandt, won the hill climb race from the Mount La Turbie with his Spyker C4 Tourer. Fast forward in 2005 and Spyker has decided to build a vehicle to commemorate that victory. In commemoration of that win, Spyker put the “La Turbie” name on its C12. Unlike the other Spyker built by the Dutch company, the C12 was the first to use the 6.0-liter W12 engine from Volkswagen. It offered 507 hp and 600 Nm (443 lb-ft) of torque for the open-top roadster. The bodywork was designed by Zagato and looked pretty much the same as the C8 Spyker, Apart from the four exhausts in the rear, different headlights and longer wheelbase, few would notice any difference. But the C8 had 4 cylinders less than the C12. Like in any other Spyker, the Dutch company decided that they want either very good drivers or dead customers. The Spyker cars didn't have any nanny to keep them on the road. No ESP, no traction control and not even an automatic gearbox. Everything was pure and straight: a manual gearbox and a good driver. The details in the vehicle were amazing. The steering wheel had a 4-blade propeller as spokes. The dashboard was covered in leather and aluminum. The switches looked just like they were stolen from a WW2 airplane. But they looked gorgeous. The car was sold in 25 units before the manual gearbox with paddle-shifters behind the steering wheel would appear.",SPYKER,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Spyker C12 La Turbie"",  ""year"": ""2005"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""vintage"", ""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""unique""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""curved""],    ""grille"": [""distinctive""],    ""hood"": [""long""],    ""headlights"": [""unique""],    ""bumper"": [""sleek""],    ""wheel"": [""large""],    ""doors"": [""stylish""],    ""roof"": [""open-top""],    ""diffusor"": [""functional""],    ""spoiler"": [""subtle""],    ""exhaust"": [""quad""]  }}```"
SPYKER C8 Laviolette,"Spyker was an unusual carmaker who started as a coachbuilder in 1880 and built the first inline-six engine in the world, but its name died when it went bankrupt in 1925. In 2000, Spyker's name was revived, and the first model produced was the C8. It was an unusual sports car with front and upward door openings and without any electronic nanny to keep the driver and the precious car on the road. It was hand-built and crafted with aeronautic-grade attention to detail. In 2001, the carmaker introduced a special edition named Laviolette. At the front, the C8 Laviolette had the same ovoid-shaped headlights with four lamps inside them. The front fascia sported the silver twin-blade propeller badge in the middle above the mesh grille. Unlike the rest of the C8 vehicles, the Laviolette's featured a see-through, clear roof. The carmaker evoked the fighter planes that used to have transparent canopies. Inside, the car unveiled its aviation heritage. The four-spoke steering wheel resembled a four-blade propeller, and the aluminum trims from the dashboard and center console inspired the same aviation theme. Spyker already knew that its customers were not focused only on the car's performance but also on the exclusivity and highest detail level in the sports car industry. Take the gear-stick, for instance. It was a lever mounted on two chromed bars. It was a unique sample of functional design never met before in any other car. Under the hood, the C8 Laviolette featured an Audi-sourced 4.2-liter V-8 engine, similar to the one installed in the A8. Unlike the German flagship model, the C8 was rear-wheel-drive only.",SPYKER,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""C8 Laviolette"",  ""year"": ""2001"",  ""size"": ""sports car"",  ""overall-design"": [""unusual"", ""hand-built"", ""aeronautic-grade attention""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""mesh"", ""silver twin-blade propeller badge""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""ovoid-shaped"", ""four lamps inside""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""front and upward door openings""],    ""roof"": [""see-through, clear""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""rear-wheel-drive only""]  }}```"
SPYKER C8 Spyder,"Spyker introduced the Spyder on the same platform as its sibling, the C8 Coupe. It preserved the unique door opening system that impressed. Revived in 2000, the Spyker was introduced on the supercars market with a unique styling and a heroic story behind it. The brand name came from an airplane maker that closed its doors in 1925, and it had an automotive section as well. Maarten de Bruijn and Victor Muller established the Spyker Cars in 1999 and launched the C8 Coupe with that history behind it. In the following year, they introduced the roadster version: the C8 Spyder. The Audi-powered supercar featured an unusual look for its headlights. They incorporated four lamps under clear glass. A mesh-grille helped to cool the engine while an extracting vent released the warm air over the raked A-pillars. With its rounded shapes all around and the short cabin, it looked like an oversized MG TF Roadster. Even the engine was in the middle, and that forced the carmaker to install additional air-intakes on top of the rear quarter-panels and on the sides. Inside, everything was covered with leather and aluminum, apart from the buttons and switches. It was clearly a car built for those who had a taste for luxury. The aluminum dash panel featured a line of gauges placed in the middle while the speedometer and tachometer took the area in front of the driver's seat. The engine compartment was in the middle and Spyker cut a deal with Audi to provide them the 4.2-liter V-8 engine used by the German carmaker on several cars. Thanks to its twin-turbo feed, the powerplant produced 525 hp.",SPYKER,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""C8 Spyder"",  ""year"": ""2000"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""unique"", ""rounded"", ""luxurious"", ""heroic"", ""compact""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [""mesh""],    ""hood"": [""rounded""],    ""headlights"": [""unusual"", ""clear-glass""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""unique""],    ""roof"": [""short""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""rear""]  }}```"
SUBARU Crosstrek,"After successfully introducing the Outback Wilderness at the beginning of 2023, Subaru also launched the Crosstrek Wilderness in April same year. The Japanese automaker was renowned for its crossovers and the all-wheel drive systems that it produced. But some customers found vehicles such as the Forester or the Tribeca too large for their daily needs and asked for smaller ones but without giving up a bit of ground clearance to make them capable of tackling unpaved roads. So, for those willing to spend their quality time in the middle of nature, Subaru made the Wilderness versions, and after the Outback, the Crosstrek followed. Sharing its platform with the rest of its siblings, the Wilderness version of the Crosstrek featured a revised look. This included exclusive body cladding with unpainted lower areas. These were scratch-resistant, so the owners didn't have to bother about damaging them over bushes. In addition, the increased ground clearance up to 9.3"" (236 mm) enhanced the rugged look of the car. Moreover, a metallic skid plate was mounted underneath the engine bay. Inside, the Crosstrek Wilderness featured water-resistant upholstery, and the front seats sported the Wilderness logo embroidered on their headrests. In addition, the copper-colored decoration that adorned the steering wheel was unique for this trim level. Moreover, Subaru installed a standard 11.6"" touchscreen for the infotainment system, a wireless charger at the bottom of the center stack, and EyeSight Driver Assist Technology. But changes continued on the technical side too. Thanks to the increased ground clearance, the approach, departure, and break-over angles had increased to 20, 33, and 21.1 degrees, respectively. In addition, the CVT gearbox featured a 4.111 final drive instead of the 3.7 as the rest of the range.",SUBARU,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Crosstrek Wilderness"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""smaller"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""revised"", ""exclusive"", ""enhanced"", ""unique""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""revised""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SUBARU Impreza,"The Japanese automaker introduced the sixth generation of the Impreza at the 2022 Los Angele Auto Show in 2022 as a 2024 model-year. While the Impreza nameplate started only as a sedan, with the introduction of the 2024 model-year the famous Subaru compact vehicle became available only as a hatchback. Still, the automaker offered a four-door version only for the WRX version but not for the rest of the range. The sixth generation of the Impreza was available in three trim levels. At first sight, it was the same vehicle as the 2020 Impreza. Yet, the front fascia received new upgrades, such as LED headlights for the entire range. Moreover, the car lost its chromed trims from the grille and the side scoops. Instead, Subaru placed only black plastic elements to adorn the car's front fascia. From its profile, depending on the trim level, the Impreza featured shiny black or body-color door mirrors. Finally, at the back, a black roof spoiler decorated the tailgate. At the same time, the c-shaped taillights also sported LED technology. The cabin was fit for five adults and provided a decent room for the rear passengers. At the front, the bolstered seats offered some side support, appreciated by those who asked for more from their Subaru. In addition, the driver benefited from the EyeSight Driver Assist Technology that helped the one behind the wheel to control the car in any situation. Atop the center stack, Subaru installed an option for an 11.6"" touchscreen for the infotainment system that featured wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Finally, the Impreza kept the 60/40 split-folding rear seats that increased the trunk's volume. Under the hood, Subaru installed a choice of two gasoline engines. The lower trim levels were powered by a 2.0-liter flat-four engine paired with a CVT. At the same time, the RS received a 2.5-liter powerplant with the same configuration paired with Subaru's Lineartronic CVT that mimicked an eight-speed automatic in manual mode. As usual, the Impreza was available exclusively as an all-wheel drive affair.",SUBARU,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Impreza"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""modern"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black"", ""plastic"", ""chromed trims removed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""shiny black or body-color""],    ""roof"": [""black"", ""spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""black""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SUBARU Legacy,"Subaru introduced the seventh generation of the Legacy in 2019 at the Chicago Auto Show and gave it a refresh three years later, in 2022, for the 2023 model year. The Japanese carmaker was always known for its advanced all-wheel drive solutions and for how its cars behave on the road. But on the other hand, the design team hardly received any medals. Still, the cars were good enough, so people bought them regardless of their look. For the 2023 model year, Subaru's design team worked a little bit more and enhanced the front fascia of the Legacy. It introduced a new set of LED headlights. Moreover, the grille was reshaped and became bolder. At the same time, the lower bumper received a set of wider side scoops than for the 2020 model year. For the Sport trim level, the carmaker added a lip spoiler on the trunk and 18"" light-alloy wheels. Inside, Subaru's most important upgrades on the car were made for the Subaru STARLINK infotainment system. While it kept the same portrait-mode 11.6"", it provided wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. Also, starting with the 2023 model year, the Legacy received improved safety systems, including automatic braking, blind-spot detection, and Automatic Emergency Steering. Under the hood, the carmaker used the same 2.5-liter naturally aspirated engine and the turbocharged 2.4-liter as on the non-facelifted version. In addition, the CVT gearbox featured a manual mode that allowed the driver to change eight fixed gear ratios.",SUBARU,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Legacy"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""bold"", ""refreshed"", ""enhanced"", ""bolder"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""reshaped"", ""bolder""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""wider"", ""sporty""],    ""wheel"": [""18-inch"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""lip""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SUBARU Ascent,"After ditching the Tribeca nameplate from its biggest SUV, Subaru introduced the Ascent on the market in late 2018, and in 2022, it unveiled the facelifted version for it. When the Japanese carmaker introduced the Ascent, it started on the wrong foot. After a few recalls and repairs, the customers were enraged, but that didn't stop Subaru from pushing harder and improving the product. One of the most important areas improved by Subaru for the 2022 Ascent was the front fascia. This received a horizontal slat that crossed the car from left to right at the upper side of the grille. Therefore, the new LED headlights received a new, C-shaped design, emphasized by two daytime running lights inside the headlamps. Depending on the trim level and options, that horizontal slat was chromed, black, or body-colored. At the back, the taillights also followed the same C-shape, replacing the older, ovoid-shaped ones. Inside, the carmaker installed a standard 11.6"" touchscreen, portrait mode, on the center stack for the entire range, regardless of the trim level, with wireless Android Auto and CarPlay. Moreover, as an option, Subaru offered a Harman Kardon sound system that integrated voice controls for the front passengers. Another feature supported by this new screen was the Bird Eye-view option that showed the car viewed from above and the surrounding area. The 8-seat Ascent was powered by the same 2.4-liter, turbocharged, flat-four engine that sent its power in all corners through Subaru's Lineartronic CVT.",SUBARU,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ascent"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""improved"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""horizontal"", ""slatted"", ""chromed"", ""black"", ""body-colored""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""C-shaped"", ""emphasized"", ""daytime running lights""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SUBARU Outback,"Subaru was relentless in its quest to transform the Outback into a capable crossover vehicle, and in 2023 it introduced the Wilderness version as a 2024 model year. While the Japanese automaker was not a serious contender in hard-core off-road vehicles, it was very capable in the crossover segment. But it knew its customers were eager to take their kayaks or mountain bikes and hit the roads to a camping area in the woods. So, to not lose these kinds of clients, Subaru offered them the Wilderness version. The Wilderness version was stripped of chromed slats on the front grille and sported a black, unpainted front bumper. Its side scoops were no longer vertical and slim but horizontal and wide, with a honeycomb pattern design. But the automaker kept the lower round fog lamps in place, exposed to elements. On its front and rear fenders, the Wilderness version has received additional molds that protect the bodywork from scratches. Finally, at the back, there was a different bumper than on the rest of the Outback range, with fat outer areas, unpainted, and scratch-resistant. Inside, the Wilderness Base version came fitted as standard with two 7” touchscreens on the center stack, where the upper one was used for the sound system while the lower provided the controls for the HVAC unit. The other trim level, Premium, received an 11.2” Multimedia Plus system that offered wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Under the hood, the only engine available was a 2.5-liter flat-four that pumped out 182 hp. Power was sent in all corners via a Lineartronic (CVT) transmission.",SUBARU,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Outback"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""capable"", ""rugged"", ""functional"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""stripped"", ""black"", ""unpainted""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""round""],    ""bumper"": [""unpainted"", ""scratch-resistant""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SUBARU BRZ,"Subaru refreshed its BRZ model and gave it more punch and a full technological pack to enhance the little coupe. In 2012, Subaru and Toyota introduced their common project for a sports car coupe. It was sold under three names: Subaru BRZ, Toyota GT86, and Scion FR-S. The latter was dropped when the Japanese sub-brand collapsed, but the other two models survived. It was a joint project where Subaru brought its flat-four engine, and Toyota made the bodywork. Soon after its launch, the customers started to ask for more power, but it was difficult to offer something more. Following the same recipe as most of the facelifts on the market, the 2021 BRZ featured a new bumper design and a new pair of headlights. Due to the wider grille in the front apron and the vertical side-scoops from its bumper, the car looked wider—a new LED daytime running light system with a J-signature enhanced the car's appearance. The BRZ featured a new set of taillights and a small ducktail on the tailgate in the rear. Inside, Subaru decided to introduce a fully digital instrument cluster with a TFT display instead of analog dials. It could show various information such as G-forces, revs per minute, speed, oil pressure, coolant temperature, amp-meter, and speed. On the center stack, Subaru placed the 6.2"" infotainment unit named Subaru Starlink. Under the hood, there was a choice of two engines, depending on the market. The 2.0-liter flat-four was upgraded with various internal components and provided 205 hp. The top version was powered by a 2.4-liter, which offered 228 hp. Both versions were paired as standard to a 6-speed manual, and a new 6-speed auto was on the options list.",SUBARU,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""BRZ"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wider""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""new"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""new design""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""small ducktail""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SUBARU WRX,"Subaru dropped the Impreza badge from the WRX version in 2014 and, by 2021, it launched the second generation of the acclaimed model on a completely different platform than the regular Impreza. When Subaru introduced the WRX lineup as a top-performance version for the Impreza, it did it to emphasize the connection with the World Rally Championship, but FIA banned them from using the WRC lettering, thus resulting in the WRX version. By 2014, the WRX badge was even better known than the Impreza nameplate, so Subaru chose to create a different lineup named WRX. In 2021, Fuji Heavy Industry, owner of the Subaru brand, introduced the second generation of the WRX, which didn’t share its platform with the rest of the Impreza range. The carmaker built it on its new Subaru Global Platform, and it includes more safety features than before. The WRX featured a different front fascia with compact LED headlights and run-around daytime running lights, unlike the regular Impreza. Its hexagonal grille, with a wider upper area, sported the Subaru logo in the middle, while the front bumper was designed with a black lower side to cope better with stone chips. From its sides, the angular cuts for the wheel wells featured black plastic over fenders, similar to those used on SUVs. Inside, the carmaker placed a tall, 11.6” touch-screen placed atop the center stack. The instrument cluster featured two wide analog dials that flanked an LCD between them for the onboard computer. For the top trim level, named GT, the carmaker added Recaro sport bucket-seats with specific embroidery. Another important upgrade was for the 2.4-liter turbocharged flat-four engine under the hood. That sent its torque in all corners via an intelligent all-wheel-drive system via a six-speed manual or an eight-speed automatic gearbox.",SUBARU,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""WRX"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""angular"", ""sporty"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""aggressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""hexagonal"", ""wider"", ""sporty""],    ""hood"": [""compact""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""compact""],    ""bumper"": [""black lower side""],    ""wheel"": [""angular cuts"", ""black plastic over fenders""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SUBARU Forester,"The fifth generation of the Subaru Forester was launched in March 2018 at the New York International Auto Show as a 2019 model. It grew in all sizes to offer more interior room, trunk space, and comfort. But it didn't forget about safety. Despite its not-so-appealing look (it is like a trademark for Subaru) the Forester has quite a few interesting features. Probably the most important is safety-related. The Japanese engineers managed to install a new system named DriverFocus. This is a driver monitoring system that uses facial recognition software to identify signs of driver fatigue or driver distraction. It works with Subaru's award-winning EyeSight Driver Assist Technology to reduce the chance of an accident. For added convenience, DriverFocus can also recognize up to five drivers and remember their presets for seat position, climate, multifunction display and more. The engine lineup is small, as usual with the Subaru vehicles. There are three options all with 4 cylinder-boxer architecture. A 2.0-liter, a 2.5-liter, and a hybrid version consist of a 2.0-liter and an electric motor. The only transmission available is a Lineartronic CVT gearbox. The 2018 Forester claims to have better performance and lower fuel consumption than the previous generation, due to new technologies involved in the engine and transmission. It still held the symmetrical all-wheel-drive system but enhanced.",SUBARU,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Subaru Forester"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""Grew in all sizes"",  ""overall-design"": [""Not-so-appealing look"", ""Safety-focused""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SUBARU Exiga Liberty,"The Exiga was the car that Subaru built as a true alternative for minivans but never sold it in the U.S. or Europe, but they sold it in Australia as the Liberty Exiga. Subaru built a few kei-cars minivans for its home market and the Impreza and the Legacy for the rest of the world. Thus, the carmaker was experienced in both areas. when it combined those skills, the result was named Exiga from ""Exciting"" and ""Active."" It was a minivan that looked more like a taller station wagon. While Subaru never excelled in car design, except when it worked with Giorgetto Giugiaro and made the SVX. That's why when it managed to create a relatively successful vehicle, such as the Impreza and the Legacy, it took the same design ideas and translated them into different sizes. The Exiga (Liberty Exiga) featured a front fascia that looked similar to the one installed on the Legacy. Its front bumper sported a lower apron and a grille which gave the car an aggressive look. From its profile, the tall greenhouse and its three wide side windows resembled an MPV, and the flat vertical tailgate confirmed that it was more of a station wagon than a minivan. Inside, the carmaker installed three rows of seats, with the last one placed higher than the front seats. Apart from the front seats, all the others were split-folding, which allowed the owner to transport a surfboard. The minimalist design lines of the dashboard provided a large display on top of the center stack and three dials inside the instrument panel. A center console divided the front seats and sported the gear-selector for the gearbox (manual, CVT, or automatic). Under the hood, the carmaker offered the Exiga a choice o three engines paired with either a five-speed manual or only with an automatic gearbox as well.",SUBARU,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Exiga"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""tall"",  ""overall-design"": [""tall"", ""aggressive"", ""minimalist"", ""functional"", ""spacious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""tall""],    ""grille"": [""aggressive""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""lower apron""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""split-folding""],    ""roof"": [""flat"", ""vertical""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SUBARU Solterra,"Subaru unveiled the 2022 Solterra in November 2021, and it showed the company's new direction towards electric vehicles. Toyota and Subaru teamed up and made the bZ4X and the Solterra, respectively. This joint operation is not random since the two carmakers made the GT86 and the BRZ together. Also, worth mentioning that in 2021, Toyota raised its stakes in Subaru from 16.8% to 20%. The Solterra (Sun-Earth in Latin) was a dynamic crossover, which still kept a traditional car design. Its angular front fascia showed a hexagonal-shaped grille covered by a panel where the Subaru badge took center stage. A slim, three-slat grille ensured the cooling for the battery pack and the vehicle's electronics on the lower side. A par of swept-back headlights with LEDs took the upper side. From its profile, a set of black plastic moldings covered the wheel arches, emphasizing the link to off-road vehicles. An unusual raked-forward tailgate in a Kamm-back design featured a roof-spoiler at the back, creating a dynamic effect. Subaru provided the same displays for the instrument panel and the infotainment system as Toyota for the interior. Even though it wasn't necessary, the carmaker placed a tall center console that divided the driver from the side passenger. Thus, it made a personal space for the one behind the wheel. At the back, there was room for three adults on a split-folding bench. While Toyota had a better experience in electric motors, Subaru knew better how to create an intelligent all-wheel-drive system. Even though there was no engine involved, it knew how much torque each axle needed to move the car in any situation in the most efficient way. Its expertise came in handy for the AWD versions. Still, the Solterra was available as a front-wheel-drive vehicle as well.",SUBARU,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Solterra"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""Dynamic crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""Traditional car design"", ""Angular front fascia"", ""Kamm-back design"", ""Dynamic effect"", ""Black plastic moldings""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""Hexagonal-shaped"", ""Slim"", ""Three-slat""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""Swept-back"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""Covered wheel arches""],    ""doors"": [""Tall center console""],    ""roof"": [""Roof-spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""Dynamic effect""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SUBARU Levorg,"Subaru introduced the first generation of the Levorg on the Japanese market in 2014, followed by the rest of the world in the following year. The Japanese created the Levorg as a crossover, replacing the station wagon version of the Legacy. Even though it was based on the same platform as that model, the marketing team considered that a new name in the stable would increase sales. Usually, Subaru didn't pay too much attention to the car's design. It spent more money on wrenches than on pencils. Thus, its cars were well-engineered but poorly designed. But that changed, and the Levorg benefited from a better-looking front fascia. The C-shaped daytime running light placed inside the headlamps emphasized the car's dimensions. They flanked the bold hexagonal grille surrounded by a chromed rim while, at the bottom, the carmaker installed a narrower secondary grille and the LED foglamps. From its profile, the car revealed a slightly sloped-down roof ended with a spoiler mounted on the upper side of the raked-forward tailgate. Thus, the car offered the image of a sporty wagon and was emphasized by the flared rear quarter panels. The interior was fitted with bucket seats at the front with high-bolstered areas. After all, Subaru was known for its sporty driving behavior. At the back, the split-folding bench offered enough room for three passengers. Under the hood, Subaru installed a choice of two turbocharged gasoline engines: a fuel-efficient 1.6-liter and a punchy 2.0-liter. Both of them were flat-four and mated to Subaru's Lineartronic CVT gearbox that sent the power in all corners.",SUBARU,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Levorg"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": ""crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""well-engineered"", ""better-looking""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""bold"", ""hexagonal"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""C-shaped"", ""daytime"", ""flanked""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloped-down"", ""spoiler"", ""raked-forward""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""upper"", ""sporty""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SUZUKI Jimny,"Suzuki finally introduced a five-door version for its small-sized off-roader Jimny in 2023 but made it available only for specific countries. Unveiled at the 2023 Auto Expo in Delhi, India, the five-door Jimny was the carmaker's answer to many critics that asked for such a version. Thus, it provided enough room in the back for passengers and, thanks to the extended wheelbase, provided better road behavior than its short-base sibling. The Jimny five-door carried over the front end of its shorter sibling but with an enhanced look on the front fascia. Thus, a black panel was installed over the four-slat grille and around the headlights and blinkers. But the main difference was on its profile, where the vehicle received a second set of doors for the rear passengers and a narrow vertical third window next to the trunk area. At the back, as its three-door sibling, the five-door Jimny got the same vertical drop for the side-hinged access tailgate. Inside, the automaker installed the same narrow but high-mounted seats at the front. The dashboard was slim and on the passenger's side, featuring a horizontally mounted grab handle. The instrument panel was fronting the driver with two large dials in individual clusters flanking a center-mounted LCD. Atop the center stack, the automaker placed the infotainment system. At the back, thanks to the longer wheelbase, the five-door Jimny finally offered more legroom for passengers. It was not enough to stretch their legs, but better. Under the hood, Suzuki installed a mild-hybrid drivetrain fitted with a 1.5-liter gasoline engine that produced a mere 105 ps (104 hp/77 kW) and 134 Nm (99 lb-ft) of torque. It was paired with either a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic. In addition, a transfer case with high and low-range gear was fitted as standard.",SUZUKI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Jimny"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""enhanced look"", ""extended wheelbase"", ""narrow vertical third window""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""four-slat"", ""black panel""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""enhanced look""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""extended wheelbase""],    ""doors"": [""five-door"", ""rear passengers""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SUZUKI Swift 5 Doors,"Suzuki was known as a great manufacturer for small cars and Swift was one of their main products that came to support that statement. In 2020, the Swift was revived with a facelift. In 2017, Suzuki introduced the fourth generation of its super-mini range, the Swift. It offered a new design and new technologies, that made it go further and be trusted on the market. By 2020, some of the technical solutions needed to be replaced, and the facelift version fixed that. On the outside, the design remained almost unchanged, but there were few details that made the 2021 model look different. For starters, there was a new mesh for the grille instead of the former horizontal slats. The headlights were slightly redesigned. There were slight modifications to the rear of the car. Inside, the first modifications were made to the instrument cluster. The dials were slightly different. In the tachometer, the coolant temperature gauge was now circular instead of a quarter circle as before and the same went with the fuel level gauge installed inside the speedometer dial. For the 2021 model, the button for the lane-keep assist was placed on the right side of the steering wheel, in the lower spoke. Under the hood, the Swift went through important modifications with the introduction of the mild-hybrid systems. A 1.2-liter engine offered 83 hp and was built for a better fuel-efficiency. It was fitted with an Integrated Starter Generator (ISG) as well. The 1.2-liter unit was available with a CVT transmission for the front-wheel-drive versions. In some markets, the 2021 model was offered with an all-wheel-drive system.",SUZUKI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Swift"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""facelift"", ""modern"", ""compact""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""mesh"", ""revised""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""redesigned""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SUZUKI Ignis,"At the beginning of 2020, Suzuki unveiled the facelift for the second generation of the Ignis. It was designed for better fuel efficiency due to a new drivetrain. The new, five-slats grille, along with the trapezoidal front and rear aprons, amplified the car's robustness. While it never won a beauty contest, the designers tried, at least, to give it a better stance. The blacked-out A- and B-pillars were part of that tryouts. The interior offered enough room for four adult passengers, even though the rear occupant's legroom was not at a high level. The urban styling taste surrounded the cabin and gave it a spacious feeling. An important part of the upgrade was the instrument cluster, with black and white, contrasting colors to offer a bold impression. The engineering department was busy developing a new, K12D Dualjet engine. It featured a dual injection system that offered a faster response and better fuel-efficiency. The high-level balance was made possible due to the electric VVT (Variable Valve Timing) and cooling jets. To further enhance the fuel-efficiency, the existing mild hybrid system powered by a lithium-ion battery was enhanced due to bigger battery capacity, expanded from 3Ah to 10 Ah. Suzuki offered the Ignis with either front- or all-wheel-drive system, with a manual or CVT gearbox.",SUZUKI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Ignis"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""robust"", ""urban"", ""spacious"", ""bold""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""five-slats"", ""trapezoidal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SUZUKI Vitara,"The Japanese car-maker Suzuki refreshed one of its best selling SUV from its stable, the Vitara. It was introduced in 2015, and three years later, it received a substantial upgrade. Forget about big, off-road vehicles. The Vitara use to eat mud for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and it could do that every day. The times were changed, and there was no longer a need for really tough off-road vehicles. But the Vitara lineup stayed in the Suzuki lineup as a capable SUV. The design was slightly changed, and it made the car looks smaller than the non-facelifted version. The designers installed six tilting slats instead of two horizontal ones from the 2015 model on the front side. The bumper remained almost the same, with fog lights installed on its sides, but with a different apron where the radar for the automatic cruise control was installed. Inside, there was a new layout for the dashboard, with colored circles around the vents. The older multi-information display from the instrument cluster was replaced by a new, 4.2” color LCD. Suzuki upgraded the 2018 Vitara with an automatic braking system and traffic sign recognition from a safety perspective. Adaptive cruise control was on the options list. The 2019 model brought some of the most important updates under the hood, where a new engine lineup was installed. The base model featured a 1.0-liter turbocharged unit, while the top-version was fitted with a 1.4-liter turbocharged unit. Both versions were available with front- or all-wheel-drive.",SUZUKI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Vitara"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""smaller"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""capable"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""tilting"", ""slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""fog"", ""lights""],    ""bumper"": [""revised"", ""apron""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SUZUKI SX4 Crossover,"With the low sales of the SX4 S-Cross released in 2013, Suzuki decided to refresh the model to attract more buyers. The new SX4 S-Cross was heavily redesigned and unveiled a completely new front end. The hood was raised and the nose became more upright, giving it a “stronger and bolder road presence” as Suzuki stated. The rather anonymous grille we’ve seen on the previous model was replaced with a bigger chrome grille with vertical bars, the bumper was refreshed and the headlights suffered significant changes. At the back, the SX4 S-Cross came with a redesigned bumper and slightly different taillights. The major upgrade was meant to bring the SX4 S-Cross closer to an SUV’s design and capabilities. The interior didn’t come with major updates, however, the quality of the materials was improved with softer plastics and optionally available brighter materials throughout. The cabin was still left with materials that were easy to scratch, but looked well finished. The infotainment system available on the SX4 S-Cross was borrowed from the Vitara and it was bigger and more responsive. The practicality offered by the SX4 S-Cross was hard to beat, as the space available was bigger than in the most crossovers. The crossover could easily accommodate up to 5 tall adults. The trunk size was increased with the help of the reclining backrest and was up to 440 liters. The ride was enhanced by the stiffer body and the tweaked suspension, and although a bit of body roll was noticeable at higher speeds, the SX4 S-Cross had a good grip and easy agile enough to offer a fun ride.",SUZUKI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""SX4 S-Cross"",  ""year"": ""2013"",  ""size"": ""bigger than most crossovers"",  ""overall-design"": [""stronger"", ""bolder"", ""redesigned"", ""practical"", ""agile""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""bigger"", ""chrome"", ""vertical bars""],    ""hood"": [""raised"", ""upright""],    ""headlights"": [""significant changes""],    ""bumper"": [""refreshed"", ""redesigned""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SUZUKI Escudo / Vitara 3 Doors,"Suzuki introduced the third generation of the Escudo/Vitara in 2005 and offered it with either three or five doors, depending on the market. While the long version, with five doors, was named Grand Vitara, the three-door model lost the ""Grand"" from its nameplate for an obvious reason: it was shorter. Maybe it wasn't that practical for transporting family and friends around, but it could fit easier in tight parking spots. In addition, the drivers didn't have to worry if they hit a curb or if there were any drainage systems that could trap their cars. Gone were the rounded shapes of the bio-design era, and Suzuki took advantage of it when it penned the Vitara. With its sharp lines and curved panels, it blended into the new-edge design trend that conquered the market. At the front, the Vitara featured big, rectangular headlights placed high above the tall bumper to protect them against shopping carts and bushes alike. From its profile, the two-door version featured a raked-forward B-pillar, which was not fitted on its longer sibling. That left the rear passengers with smaller side windows ending at the back on the tilted C-pillars. Suzuki chose to install the spare wheel on the tailgate, leaving more room for the trunk area. Inside, despite the hard-plastic materials used on most of the panels and dashboard, the cabin offered a pleasant ambiance. The clean design was disturbed only by the numerous buttons on the center stack, where the buttons for the audio and HVAC systems were placed. In the back, there was very limited room for passengers, while the trunk was large enough for just a few backpacks. Under the hood, the Japanese carmaker installed either a 1.6-liter gasoline engine or a 1.9-liter (Fiat-sourced) turbo-diesel, depending on the market. Power went to all four wheels via a two-speed transfer case and a five-speed manual.",SUZUKI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Escudo/Vitara"",  ""year"": ""2005"",  ""size"": ""Shorter, compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""Sharp lines"", ""Curved panels"", ""New-edge design""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""Rounded"", ""Short""],    ""headlights"": [""Big"", ""Rectangular""],    ""bumper"": [""Tall""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""Three or five doors"", ""Raked-forward B-pillar""],    ""roof"": [""Spare wheel on tailgate""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SUZUKI Swace,"Suzuki and Toyota were not at their first car built together, but the 2020 Suzuki Swace was a badge engineering between the two brands. It is hard to look at the Suzuki Swace and not recognize the Toyota Corolla Touring Sports (station-wagon). While it might sound redundant to offer the same car with different badges, it made sense. It helped Suzuki to increase its market share in the car-market, with a model proven for its reliability and, since it was a hybrid, to lower its manufacturer's emissions as well. The front fascia showed a deeply sculptured bumper with various designs for the lower apron and deep side-scoops. Visually, it featured a huge center grille, like a shark mouth. It was smaller than it looked since the middle segment was painted in black. The narrow LED headlights were carried-over from the Corolla, but the small grille and the badge on the hood were specific to Suzuki. In the back, apart from the Suzuki logo on the tailgate, the rest of the car was a Corolla, with the same sculptured shape for the bumper and hidden exhaust tip under the apron. The interior featured a black dashboard with an 8” touch-screen infotainment display on top of the center stack. It was Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatible. The instrument cluster featured three dials: the tachometer, the centrally-mounted speedometer, and the fuel gauge on the right side. There was no coolant temperature gauge. For the drivetrain, the Swace featured the same hybrid system as the Corolla, with a 1.8-liter gasoline engine and an electric motor, both paired to a CVT. The system was proven to be very fuel-efficient in the Prius as well.",SUZUKI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Suzuki Swace"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""station-wagon"",  ""overall-design"": [""reliable"", ""hybrid"", ""sculptured"", ""black dashboard"", ""fuel-efficient""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""center grille"", ""shark mouth""],    ""hood"": [""badge""],    ""headlights"": [""narrow LED""],    ""bumper"": [""deeply sculptured"", ""various designs"", ""smaller than it looked"", ""hidden exhaust tip""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""hidden tip""]  }}```"
SUZUKI Across,"Toyota used to build cars with other car-makers. It made the AE86 with Subaru, the Supra with BMW, and the Roomy with Daihatsu. By 2021, Toyota expands its cooperation and shares the Rav4 Hybrid assembly line with the Suzuki Across. There were few differences between those two vehicles, both on the outside and on the interior. The designers gave a new face for the Rav4 and made it look like a Suzuki. It wasn't just a badge replacement. The hood had to be the same as its Toyota brother, but the rest was changed. As a result, the slim LED headlights with their daytime running lights placed on the upper side inspired a pair of angry eyes. The bumper featured a big honeycomb A-shaped grille that was extended down to the lower side. On the bottom, a silver plastic shield was installed to remind customers that Suzuki once did very tough little off-road vehicles such as Samurai, Vitara, or Jimny. In the back, the Across featured the same taillights as its sibling, but the bumper was slightly different. Inside, the steering wheel was typical for a Suzuki. On top of the center stack, Across offered a 9"" touch-screen for the infotainment system. The cabin provided enough room for five adults and their luggage. Since the all-wheel-drive system was based on electric motors for the rear axle, the center tunnel was shorter, so a third person could stay in the middle on the bench. Under the hood, there was the same Toyota hybrid system. There was a 2.5-liter Atkinson cycle engine mated to an e-CVT gearbox. While the hybrid system powered the front wheels, the rear axle was fitted with an electric motor.",SUZUKI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Rav4 Hybrid"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""new face"", ""slim LED headlights"", ""big honeycomb A-shaped grille"", ""silver plastic shield"", ""taillights"", ""spacious cabin""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""big honeycomb A-shaped""],    ""hood"": [""same as Toyota brother""],    ""headlights"": [""slim"", ""LED"", ""upper side placement""],    ""bumper"": [""featured a big honeycomb A-shaped grille"", ""silver plastic shield""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SUZUKI Escudo / Grand Vitara 3 Doors,"Suzuki refreshed the Grand Vitara/Escudo lineup in 2008, preparing the car for the Euro 5 emission standards and enhancing the car's exterior. The Grand Vitara/Escudo was one of the best-selling cars in its class globally. It was available under different names on different markets and sported different badges as well. To keep its prices low, the carmaker produced it in Hungary, Algeria, and China. For the drivetrains, it worked together with Renault for the diesel powerplants. On the outside, the 2008 model featured a new grille at the front with curved horizontal slats instead of the straight ones used between 2005 and 2008. Its rectangular headlights with clear lenses. The three-door version looked sportier thanks to its long rear quarter panels and the raked-forward B-pillar. Inside, the carmaker improved the safety with redesigned airbags. At the front, the bucket seats featured side airbags, complementing the dual front airbags. The redesigned center stack sported a circular digital display for the climate control unit on the lower side and a new CD radio on the upper side. In the back, as usual, there was limited room for the rear passengers due to the short wheelbase. Under the hood, Suzuki replaced or upgraded the engines. It dropped the former 2.7-liter V-6 and installed a GM-sourced 3.2-liter instead. For the European market, the carmaker offered a choice of two gasoline and a Renault-sourced turbo-diesel powerplant.",SUZUKI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Grand Vitara/Escudo"",  ""year"": ""2008"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""sporty"", ""improved safety"", ""limited rear space""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""curved horizontal slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""rectangular"", ""clear lenses""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""three-door"", ""long rear quarter panels"", ""raked-forward B-pillar""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SUZUKI APV,"Suzuki introduced the APV in 2004 as a solution for cramped urban areas. It was built in various versions, including a pick-up, a panel van, and a passenger car. Deemed as one of the biggest carmakers for small vehicles, Suzuki understood that the Sout-Eastern side of Asia needs more small, affordable cars. So in Indonesia, the Japanese carmaker produced the vehicle at its plant in Bekasi, West Java, and made it available in more than 100 countries worldwide in emerging markets. In terms of maximizing space, it was hard to compete against the APV. Suzuki took the kei-car concept from Japan and translated it into larger, yet still small-sized, vehicles. Thus, the APV was high but short and narrow. At the front, the rectangular headlights were placed way above a tall bumper to be protected from minor bumps. They sat even above the grille, which sported a couple of slats. The car featured a short, sloped hood, followed by a not-so-raked windshield. On the sides, the carmaker made the door panels, fenders, and windows flat and vertical, so the car ended up with a spacious cabin. At the back, Suzuki placed a straight-up tailgate to access the trunk. Inside, the four-door vehicle offered high-mounted seats. Thus, despite the short wheelbase, the APV offered enough room for up to six passengers. In terms of interior design, the APV featured cheap plastic materials for the dashboard, door cards, and center console. But it served the purpose and was a very affordable people carrier. Under the hood, the APV got a choice of two engines, depending on the market. Both versions were mated to a five-speed manual that sent its power to the rear wheels.",SUZUKI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""APV"",  ""year"": ""2004"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""small-sized"", ""spacious"", ""affordable"", ""high-mounted seats"", ""short wheelbase""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""short"", ""not-so-raked""],    ""grille"": [""rectangular headlights"", ""tall bumper"", ""couple of slats""],    ""hood"": [""short"", ""sloped""],    ""headlights"": [""rectangular""],    ""bumper"": [""tall""],    ""wheel"": [""rear wheels""],    ""doors"": [""flat"", ""vertical"", ""four-door""],    ""roof"": [""short""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SUZUKI Baleno,"In the spring of 2016, Suzuki launched the Baleno hatchback on the European market. Even though it wasn't a new name for the Japanese brand, the car tried to offer compact-class room in small class size. Suzuki was well known as a big manufacturer for small cars. He tried to upscale its models but it didn't succeed. Its main products were the little Swift, the small off-roader Jimny and, of course, the Grand Vitara SUV. A car that it wasn't that grand, but it was a well received SUV by the market. How about the Baleno? Was it enough for the market? From the outside, the Baleno featured a small grille between two bigger headlights. The front fascia was rather flat than raked. The A-pillars though were a different story. They had to be raked to give a sportier look of the car. From the side, the Baleno was a mix between a small-class hatchback and a small-class SUV. Despite its overall length that was on the small-class size, the interior room was big. Its trunk was large enough to compete in the compact-class. The rear seats could have been folded in a 60:40 split way. In the front, the Baleno featured a 7” infotainment system on the dashboard and a 4.2” display between the dials in the instrument cluster. The Baleno was available with two engine choices, both with gasoline. Both were mated to a standard 5-speed manual. A 6-speed automatic was available as an option for the top version.",SUZUKI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Baleno"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""compact-class"",  ""overall-design"": [""compact"", ""sporty"", ""roomy"", ""upscale"", ""flat-front""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [""small""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""bigger""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
SUZUKI S-Cross,"Suzuki unveiled the third generation of the S-Cross crossover in late 2021 and, due to the pandemic situation, it had to do that in an online event. The car was not completely new, though, since it shared its platform with its predecessor. But that was not a bad thing at all since the S-Cross' second generation was an appreciated vehicle. Both were built at Suzuki's plant from Hungary and exported in Europe and a few other countries around the world. But Suzuki did make a new bodywork with a strong appearance. At the front, the tall grille flanked by three LED position lamps created an SUV stance. Even though it kept the rounded edges and raised beltline towards the back of the car, it didn't have the same hatchback look as its predecessor. After all, Suzuki was known for its off-road abilities, especially with the Jimny and Vitara models. At the back, the clear taillights were out of fashion for other carmakers, but Suzuki gave them a second chance and installed them on the S-Cross. Inside, the car received more standard options, even for the base trim level. It still kept the analog dials, despite the market's general trend towards TFT displays in the instrument cluster. Above the center stack, in a floating position, the carmaker placed a 7"" touch-screen for the infotainment system, with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. Even though it was more of a budget vehicle, it still provided a panoramic sunroof as an option. Under the hood, Suzuki placed its bets on a 1.4-liter turbocharged engine. A 48-volt mild-hybrid architecture was also available. For the transmission, the S-Cross relied on the same Haledx-based all-wheel-drive system controlled via a rotary knob placed on the center console.",SUZUKI,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""S-Cross"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""strong appearance"", ""SUV stance"", ""off-road abilities""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""rounded""],    ""grille"": [""tall""],    ""hood"": [""raised""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""position""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""analog dials"", ""floating touch-screen""],    ""roof"": [""panoramic""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""turbocharged"", ""mild-hybrid""]  }}```"
TATA MOTORS Safari,"The Tata Safari was introduced on the market in 1998 and it featured a body-on-frame structure that was kept along the way. It was transferred to the 2012 model Safari Storm, which was very similar. Tata is one of the biggest car-maker in India and it owns the Jaguar-Land Rover group. Despite having one of the most experienced off-road brands in the world, it didn't rebadge one of the British vehicles. It just improved the existing Safari. The exterior look is very similar to the original, 1998, Safari. The front and the rear were changed. A new pair of headlights with clear lenses were introduced. In the back, the biggest change was the removal of the tailgate-mounted spare wheel. It was moved under the floor. From the side, the only change was to the rear-view mirror cases, which were chromed. The high step inside the car was kept, but it was a price paid for the big ground clearance. Inside, the Tata said that not a single screw or bolt was carried-over from the non-facelifted version. Apart from the after-market look of the CD-radio installed in the center stack, everything else looked better. A new finish in wood grain, chromed lines, and better finishes were the main improvements brought by the Safari Storm. The leather upholstery was offered as an option. In the trunk area, the Storm offered two additional side-mounted seats. Under the hood, the Safari Storm offered a new 2.2-liter diesel engine with a variable turbocharger that offered 156 hp. It was mated as standard to a 6-speed manual. The braking system was upgraded with disc-brakes in all four corners. It was available as a 4x2 or a 4x4 traction system.",TATA MOTORS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Tata Safari"",  ""year"": ""2012"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""similar to original Safari"", ""improved exterior look""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""changed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""new pair with clear lenses""],    ""bumper"": [""changed""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""high step inside""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TATA MOTORS Indigo,"The Tata Indigo reached its second generation in 2009, after various updates for its first generation. It was unveiled in October 2009 and it wasn't based on the same platform as its predecessor. When India needed a cheap car, with low running costs and reliable, the Tata Industry launched the Indica. It was designed and built mainly for the Indian market, but it was also exported in other countries and in Europe. The simple design of the first generation was updated for the 2009 model, Indigo Manza. Since it was based on the same platform as the Indica Vista and it shared both the name and the platform, the Manza featured the same headlight design and some of the parts until the B-pillar. But, since the Manza was basically the three-box version of the Vista, it had a different C-pillar and ending. Depending on the trim level, the Indica Manza featured alloy-wheels. Inside, the Manza was offered in various trim levels. Even for the base trim level, the Indica Manza Aqua was equipped with a 2Din audio system. On the upper versions, named Aura, Aura (ABS) and Aura +, the car featured more amenities, including leather seats, airbag and air-conditioning. Tata Indica Manza was a joint development with Fiat, who provided the 1.4-liter gasoline engine and the 1.3-liter turbocharged diesel unit. Both were mated to a standard 5-speed manual.",TATA MOTORS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Tata Indica Manza"",  ""year"": ""2009"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""simple"", ""reliable"", ""cheap""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""simple""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""shared with Indica Vista"", ""same design as Indica Vista until B-pillar""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""alloy-wheels""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TATA MOTORS Harrier,"The compact SUV Tata Harrier made its world debut in 2019 and it is a big step forward for the Indian manufacturer. A pleasant surprise into a crowded market, but unfortunately, the Harrier doesn't leave India, though it might have had a big impact on the European market. The 4.6-meter (181-in) long SUV promises to accommodate up to five people and 425 liters (15 cu-ft) of luggage, but it can extend to almost double that, with the rear seats folded down: 810 liters (28.6 cu-ft). Big surprises are on the inside, where the Indian company has tried to do bold moves, with a wooden covered dashboard, leather seats, and an up-to-date instrument cluster and infotainment system. Customers will have up to three USB ports in front and rear. As expected, the touch-screen floating-type display mounted on top of the dashboard supports both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Technologically speaking, Tata made a big step forward with a new platform architecture, which is called the OMEGA (Optimal Modular Efficient Global Advanced Architecture). It is based on high-strength steel and a unibody safety cell. The Tata Harrier is offered with a 2.0-liter turbodiesel engine, which offers 170 HP. Depending on the trim level, this can be coupled either with a 6-speed automatic transmission or with a 6-speed manual transmission. Both variants are front-wheel driven and there is no option for an AWD system.",TATA MOTORS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Tata Harrier"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""4.6-meter long"",  ""overall-design"": [""compact"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""stylish"", ""bold""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""angled""],    ""grille"": [""bold""],    ""hood"": [""streamlined""],    ""headlights"": [""modern""],    ""bumper"": [""integrated""],    ""wheel"": [""large""],    ""doors"": [""sleek""],    ""roof"": [""sloping""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TATA MOTORS Nexon,"The Nexon wants to be the next cool small SUV-coupe for the Indian market. The Indian manufacturer struggled to make it as small as possible on the outside but packed with interesting interior amenities and enough room for five. Of course, you won't be able to fit any elephant in it. With a 4 meter length (13.1 ft) and 1.81-meter width (5.9 ft), the Tata Nexon can offer enough room for the crowded cities in India. Maybe it could do a good impression on some other European markets as well if it would be sold there. The power comes from either a 1.2-liter 3-cylinder turbocharged gasoline engine or a 1.5-liter 4-cylinder turbodiesel unit. While the first offers 120 HP, the other one is good for 110 HP. Both engine variants may be fitted with either a manual or an automatic transmission. Neither versions can be fitted with an AWD system, which makes this Nexon more like a crossover rather than a small SUV. Inside we noticed a very special infotainment system, which allows the driver to enter into a “Tata owners” community, and share different hazards on the road or speed-traps, traffic jams and others. The manufacturer didn't confirm or denied if the infotainment system can cope with Android Auto or CarPlay.",TATA MOTORS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Tata Nexon"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""small SUV-coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""compact"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""angled""],    ""grille"": [""bold""],    ""hood"": [""curved""],    ""headlights"": [""sharp"", ""stylish""],    ""bumper"": [""aggressive""],    ""wheel"": [""sporty""],    ""doors"": [""streamlined""],    ""roof"": [""sloping""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TATA MOTORS Sumo,"According to the carmaker, Tata introduced the Sumo nameplate in 1994 for a rugged multi-use-vehicle or MUV. India was the eighth country globally by its size, and its road network was not properly developed when the local carmaker introduced the Sumo. It built the vehicle, judging by what the customers need, and this was a great answer. It was a vehicle built on a robust chassis, with rear-wheel drive and able to carry ten people inside. It went through two updates before 2007 when the Sumo Victa was introduced to the market. While the main difference was the turbocharged diesel engine, some other modifications were made to keep the car competitive on the market. From the outside, the Sumo Victa marked a return of the squared headlights. Its predecessor, the Sumo Spacio, featured round headlamps. Its flat-panels for the bodywork, with a steep and flat windshield, left no room for interpretation. It was built for a purpose, not for winning a design contest. Inside, the carmaker installed two seats at the front, a bench in the middle, and two side benches in the trunk. Thus, it could easily fit ten occupants, including the driver. But there was no guarantee that its users didn't try to fit more, and the carmaker knew that. In the back, a large, side-opened door granted easier access for the rear passengers. Tata set the air-conditioning on the options list, but the power steering was fitted as standard. Under the hood, Tata introduced a newly developed 3.0-liter turbodiesel, which provided up to 85 hp. It was paired to a 5-speed manual transmission. It was available with either rear- or all-wheel-drive system.",TATA MOTORS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Tata Sumo"",  ""year"": ""1994"",  ""size"": ""Large"",  ""overall-design"": [""Rugged"", ""Robust"", ""Functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""Steep"", ""Flat""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""Flat""],    ""headlights"": [""Squared""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""Side-opened""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TATA MOTORS Nano,"It was supposed to be the cheapest car worldwide, and its closest relative was a rickshaw. The only difference was that it featured a windshield wiper and four wheels. India's road network was the second busiest in the world. Also, the average income was very low. The Indian Tata company imagined a car that could transport four adults in better conditions than a rickshaw. And the result was incredible by any standards. The price was affordable for many, but the actual sales were a disaster. Eventually, Tata pulled the plug on the project, and it was a big money loss for the company. The egg-shaped vehicle featured short overhangs both front and rear. Even the headlights were installed upright. On the sides, behind the rear doors, it featured two air-intakes that led to the engine compartment, which was located under the rear trunk. The carmaker installed only one windshield wiper and a single door-mirror on the driver's side to cut costs. Inside, there was a curved-shaped dash panel with an open storage area in front of the passenger. The dials were placed in the middle, on top of the center stack. That solution was adopted to make an easier conversion for the left-hand-drive versions. On the instrument cluster, there were two dials and a small LCD. Tata installed a 2-cylinder, four-stroke engine under the rear bench and trunk. It was paired to a 4-speed manual gearbox and sent the power to the rear wheels.",TATA MOTORS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Tata Nano"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""affordable"", ""egg-shaped"", ""compact"", ""simple"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""single"", ""functional""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""short overhangs""],    ""headlights"": [""upright""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""four""],    ""doors"": [""single""],    ""roof"": [""curved-shaped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""rear""]  }}```"
TATA MOTORS Altroz,"Tata Motors revealed the new Altroz model as the first vehicle based on its own platform called ALFA (Agile Light Flexible Advanced). The new design language is called IMPACT 2.0 and it is a combination of sharp, edgy and curves. The new hatch-back from Tata is an important step forward towards the 21st century integration of its vehicles. From the company's past designs to tomorrow's vehicles, Tata engineers found a way to launch a vehicle with a fresh look in their line-up. Their urban vehicle is offered as a five door only with a small trunk behind the backseats. The Altroz is an urban vehicle under 4 meters (157.5 in) long and it can accommodate five adults inside. The dashboard comprises a 7” TFT infotainment system. Enhanced haptics are used inside for controls and the touch-sensitive screen. The Altroz was created to also accommodate a wide range of connectivity solutions for its passengers. The ALFA Architecture allows multiple body styles and different engines. The Altroz is the first vehicle built by Tata on this platform and it is offered with two engine choices: one 1,2 liter gasoline engine with 86 HP and a four cylinder 1,5 liter diesel engine with 90 HP.

TATA MOTORS Aria,"After purchasing the Jaguar-Land Rover brands, the Indian carmaker Tata Motors started to work together with the British engineers, developing new models, and the Aria was one of them. While Jaguar and Land Rover had significant experience in building luxury and off-road vehicles, its engineers didn't know how to make a budget car. Still, they worked together with their Indian colleagues and helped them develop a unique car: the Aria. It was a mix between a station wagon, an MPV, and an SUV. Tata designers made tall side panels for the doors and rear quarter fenders, and smaller windows. The front of the car, on the other hand, featured a tall fascia with an upper grille integrated into the hood and a lower grille in the apron. Its short overhang favored the car's off-road abilities. Its headlights looked more appropriate for a sedan or a station wagon. Inside, the 2-3-2 layout provided room for up to seven people on board. Inside, the car's roof sported a long rack with storage compartments and LED lights. It resembled an airplane design. Inside, the carmaker installed a wide and tall dashboard with a clean layout for the center stack and the center console. On top of the center stack, Tata installed a display for the infotainment system, which was positioned above the climate control unit. The high-mounted seats at the front and in the middle row allowed the carmaker to install a third row in the back. Apart from the front seats, all the others could have been folded down, enlarging the loading area. Tata offered the Aria with a 2.2-liter turbo-diesel engine paired to a five-speed manual. It provided it either with a rear or a four-wheel-drive system.",TATA MOTORS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Aria"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""tall, long"",  ""overall-design"": [""unique"", ""mix of styles"", ""off-road oriented""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""tall""],    ""grille"": [""tall"", ""integrated""],    ""hood"": [""tall""],    ""headlights"": [""sedan-like""],    ""bumper"": [""short overhang""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""tall side panels"", ""smaller windows""],    ""roof"": [""long rack"", ""airplane design""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TATA MOTORS Indigo SW,"Tata unveiled the Indigo in 2002, and it was based on the same platform as the Indica, a subcompact hatchback. The station wagon version became available in 2004. Tata Motors was part of one of the biggest companies in India, Tata Group. The Indica was designed to be an affordable vehicle for the masses and soon became very popular. It was a young carmaker since its first passenger vehicle was introduced in 1988 and also was the first Indian company that developed a car from scratch, the Telcoline pickup. The Indian carmaker used a stretched version of the Indigo platform to create the Indica in 2002. It featured modern headlights with incorporated turn-signals on top and clear lenses. The short hood and raked windshield made the vehicle very good in congested traffic. Unlike its sedan sibling, the Indigo SW featured a longer cabin with a roofline extended over the luggage compartment and an additional window behind the rear doors. Inside, it provided enough room for five adult passengers, but with limited legroom for the rear ones. Its dashboard featured a storage area on top and another one under the steering column. The instrument cluster featured two large dials for the tachometer and speedometer and, inside them, the gauges for the fuel level and coolant temperature. Since it was a station wagon, the carmaker installed a folding seatback for the bench, enlarging the trunk area. It was not a split-folding type but a one-piece system. Tata installed two engine options under the Indigo's hood: 1.4-liter gasoline and a very fuel-efficient 1.4-liter turbodiesel. Both were paired to a five-speed manual gearbox.",TATA MOTORS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Indigo"",  ""year"": ""2002"",  ""size"": ""subcompact"",  ""overall-design"": [""affordable"", ""modern"", ""spacious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""short""],    ""headlights"": [""modern"", ""clear""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""extended""],    ""roof"": [""extended""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TATA MOTORS Telcoline Double Cab,"The Indian carmaker Tata produced this mid-size pickup mostly for the emerging markets and improved it over the years. In India, it was also known as Tatamobile, and it was one of the most successful light-utility off-road vehicles. The carmaker tried to build it affordable, easy to maintain, and cheap to run. It wasn't built for some stunning performances on or off-road. The Tata group engineers knew that a rounded shape costs more than a simple, flat sheet of metal, and that's why they made the Telcoline in a wedged style. It was a form-follow-function concept that worked well. With its body-on-frame construction and just a few lines on its sides, the Indian pickup was not the most attractive car to see, but neither the worst design ever. Inside, everything was gray: the steering wheel, the upholstery, the dashboard, and the ceiling. Telcoline featured a pair of seats at the front and a bench in the rear. On specific markets, the vehicle was available with a front bench, fit for three occupants. The high seating position allowed the rear passengers to have adequate legroom but limited headroom. While the standard version offered cranked windows and a steering wheel, the upper trim level offered an air-conditioning unit and a CD-stereo. Under the hood, depending on the production year and market, Tata installed either a 2.0-liter turbodiesel or a 3.0-liter naturally aspirated diesel. There was only a gearbox available, a 5-speed manual.",TATA MOTORS,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Tata Telcoline"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""mid-size pickup"",  ""overall-design"": [""affordable"", ""utilitarian"", ""wedged style"", ""simple"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""rounded""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""flat""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""cranked windows""],    ""roof"": [""gray interior"", ""high seating position""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""2.0-liter turbodiesel or 3.0-liter naturally aspirated diesel""]  }}```"
TOYOTA Tacoma,"The Toyota Tacoma burst into the market in 1995 as a compact pickup truck. Throughout the next two generations, the Japanese carmaker shifted toward a more extensive body for the car, classifying it as a mid-size pickup truck. The 2024 model marks the start of the fourth Tacoma generation, and it is meant to continue the legacy of one of the most renowned pickup trucks in the North American market in the past couple of decades. It will be available in multiple grades, namely: SR, SR5, TRD PreRunner, TRD Sport, TRD Off Road, Limited, TRD Pro, and Trailhunter. While inheriting the ""Tacoma-ness"" from its predecessors, the new version is the first one built on the TNGA-F global truck platform, being also resketched from the ground up. The boxier stance gives the car a more modern off-road look, underlining its off-road capability. A new multi-link rear suspension replaces the old leaf springs, helping increase the handling and stability of the truck, while the TRD Off-Road grade will be equipped with Bilstein remote reservoir monotube shocks to improve heat dissipation. Improving the power of the car to match the handling abilities was a must, and Toyota did that by adding the option of the iForce MAX hybrid powertrain, which can develop 326 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque to help overcome even the biggest obstacles in an off-road adventure. If there is a need the electronically activated locking rear differential can do a 50/50 power split to the rear wheels. Toyota also offers a six-speed intelligent manual transmission with automatic rev-matching and anti-stall technology for people who want a more in-depth feeling of their truck when they are off the road. To improve overall driving on all sorts of terrain the TRD Pro grade is equipped with an IsoDynamic Performance Seat which allows for simultaneous vertical and lateral movements that aim to reduce the vibrations and shocks transferred to the driver, for a smoother and less tiring drive. The Trailhunter grade is meant to be an overlanding rig that requires no further modifications for offering one of the best experiences on the market. It comes with an Adaptive Variable Suspension, an integrated high-output air compressor, and a heavy-duty version of the bed rack that can support additional weight from a tent or any other type of camping necessity. For a complete experience, the 2024 Tacoma has, besides a 14-inch high-quality touchscreen, a premium JBL 10 speakers' system, paired with a JBL Bluetooth speaker that acts like a center speaker when it's docked in the car and can also be undocked and used for up to six hours to entertain tailgate parties, off-road camping adventures and many more scenarios where the truck becomes the center of a social gatherings.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Toyota Tacoma"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""mid-size pickup truck"",  ""overall-design"": [""boxier"", ""modern"", ""off-road"", ""powerful"", ""adventurous""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""boxy""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""resketched"", ""boxier""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA C-HR,"Toyota launched the second generation of the C-HR crossover in the summer of 2023, and despite the fact that the car's overall design looked similar to the old one, it was an entirely new vehicle. When Toyota introduced the first C-HR in 2016, it actually came late to the party. At that time, there were already many other carmakers that offered similarly-sized vehicles. But the Japanese automaker used that time to create a better product, and in a way, it did that. The car was designed well, had fuel-efficient engines, and it looked fresh. It still had its drawbacks in terms of comfort, but the second generation of the C-HR solved most of them or at least improved them. The vehicle's exterior kept the original shape of its predecessor, but the design was drastically improved. At the front fascia, Toyota installed slim, C-shaped LED headlights. The front bumper was massive, sporting the main trapezoidal grille on its lower side. In addition, it also featured a pair of fog lamps, available either as standard or as an option, depending on the trim level. From its side, the most significant change was for the door handles that were retractable and flush with the bodywork. Finally, at the rear, the raked-forward tailgate had the taillights integrated into its vertical side. Unfortunately, that led to a massive rear fascia dominated by plastic panels and a fake grille on the bumper. Overall, the car looked sportier than before, and thanks to the new color options that allowed customers to create a two-tone paint job, it proved that it aimed at students and young couples. The previous C-HR looked more like a vehicle designed for young parents. Inside, the biggest difference for the vehicle was the 12.3” infotainment unit that ran the latest Toyota Entune system and supported Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. In addition, the automaker also offered a digital instrument cluster. The driving position was still the same as on the 2016 model since customers liked it. In the back, on the other hand, things were not significantly improved. Still, there were bigger windows for the rear doors, and a fixed glass roof was also available, improving the interior light. But the biggest change for the C-HR was found under its skin. Just like its predecessor, it was available with a hybrid system but with an option for a two-liter, 198 PS (195 HP) drivetrain. In addition, the automaker also provided the C-HR with a plug-in hybrid version that put out up to 223 PS (220 HP) sent to the front wheels only via an E-CVT gearbox. Those who still wanted an all-wheel-drive version of the C-HR could get the 1.8-liter hybrid drivetrain that provided a total output of 140 PS (138 HP). This model also used a continuously variable transmission gearbox.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""C-HR"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""fresh"", ""two-tone paint job"", ""youthful"", ""raked-forward tailgate""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""trapezoidal"", ""massive""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""slim"", ""C-shaped"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""massive"", ""front""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""retractable"", ""flush""],    ""roof"": [""fixed glass""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Corolla Touring,"Toyota introduced a facelifted version for the Corolla's twelfth generation in 2022 for the 2023 model year, and that also affected the long roof version, officially known as the Touring Sports. Introduced in 1966, the Japanese vehicle became a worldwide sensation. By 2022, Toyota sold more than fifty-million units of this nameplate. The automaker tried to create a car for everyone and did that better than anyone else. By producing it as a sedan, five-door hatchback, and station wagon, most people could get one to fit their needs. In 2018, Toyota introduced the twelfth generation of this nameplate. Four years later, the carmaker brought the facelifted version, which also affected the station wagon. While it kept a similar front fascia, with the same angry-looking headlights, these were different than the pre-facelifted version and featured bi-LED lights. Also, the bumper featured a broad grille with a trapezoidal shape in the middle. On the lower side, this was flanked by the foglamps' scoops. From its profile, the darkened B- and C-posts, combined with the sloped-down roof line, resembled a shooting brake shape. Finally, at the back, the roof spoiler mounted on the upper side of the raked-forward tailgate amplified the car's sporty look. Inside, the automaker installed new upholstery with a 3D pattern. On the dashboard, the automaker offered an option for a 10.5"" touchscreen mounted in a floating position. Starting from the mid-grade level. The Corolla Touring Sports featured a 12.3"" display for the instrument panel instead of traditional dials and gauges. In the back, the 40/20/40 split-folding bench allowed customers to enlarge the trunk area. Under the hood, the automaker installed a choice of two hybrid drivetrains.

TOYOTA Corolla Sedan,"Toyota refreshed the twelfth generation of the Corolla in 2022 for the European market and continued to offer it in three shapes, including the four-door sedan. After almost six decades since the nameplate's introduction, the Corolla was the best-selling car in the world, with more than fifty-million units delivered.

TOYOTA Prius,"Toyota unveiled the fifth generation of the Prius in late 2022, and the Japanese automaker finally focused more on the car's design, creating a better-looking vehicle. With a drag coefficient of just 0.26, the 2023 Prius boasted a sleek look with a bold front fascia that featured C-shaped daytime running lights while the headlights were placed underneath them. The profile revealed a raked windshield that could suit better on a sports car. It was continued by an arched roof followed in the back by a sloped rear windscreen in a Kammback-style with a tall rear end. Dropping the unpainted plastics in favor of gloss-black elements helped the car's back look better. Like its predecessor, the fifth-generation Prius boasted a high-tech interior. After years of placing the instrument panel in the dashboard's center, Toyota finally moved it in front of the driver in the form of a TFT display. In addition, atop the center stack, the carmaker placed a 12.3"" touchscreen for the infotainment unit, fitted with a volume knob. Yet, that button was placed on the right side. The Prius featured a center console that hosted the transmission lever between the front bucket seats. Yet, the automaker could have done better with a few buttons or a rotary dial. In the back, the car could accommodate three occupants on the split-folding bench. Yet, the headroom was not something to write home about it. The car's underpinnings were based on a new hybrid system that relied on a 2.0-liter Atkinson engine paired with an electric motor for a total output of 194 hp (197 PS) in the FWD version. In addition, Toyota also offered two AWD versions, fitted with a 196 hp (199 PS) or a 220 hp (223 PS) powertrain.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Prius"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""bold"", ""high-tech"", ""sporty"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""arched""],    ""headlights"": [""C-shaped"", ""underneath""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""front"", ""bucket""],    ""roof"": [""arched""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Sequoia,"Toyota unveiled the third generation of its largest SUV, the Sequoia, at the beginning of 2022 and built it on the same platform as the rugged Tundra pickup truck. Introduced more than two decades ago, in 2000, the Sequoia heralded Toyota's entry in the same league with the Ford Excursion and Chevrolet Tahoe. In 2007, the Japanese carmaker introduced the second generation of its flagship SUV, apart from the Lexus brand. But it took another 14 years to launch a completely new model. At the front, the car shared the main panels with its pickup-truck sibling, featuring similar headlights and a massive grille. Under the fat bumper, an aluminum-like shield protected the vehicle's underbelly. From the side, the biggest Toyota SUV from its 2022 lineup boasted a straight line that emerged from the hood to the D-pillar in the back. Its enlarged wheel fenders and quarter panels evoked a stronger presence. The carmaker suggested that it might resemble a sumo warrior. Inside, the Sequoia offers room for up to eight passengers on three seat rows in a 2-3-3 configuration, depending on the options. For the interior, Toyota installed a dashboard similar to the Tundra's, albeit it added the trim level in front of the passenger and ambient lighting, depending on the version. In addition, a 14"" touch-screen dominated the upper side of the center stack and provided Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. Since it was based on the same platform as the Tundra, it featured a fully independent front suspension and a five-link in the back. The drivetrain offered a hybrid system that sends the power to the rear wheels or in all corners, depending on the trim level.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Sequoia"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""largest SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""straight-lined"", ""enlarged"", ""strong presence"", ""resembles sumo warrior""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""massive""],    ""hood"": [""straight-lined""],    ""headlights"": [""similar""],    ""bumper"": [""fat"", ""aluminum-like shield""],    ""wheel"": [""enlarged fenders""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Corolla Cross,"Toyota introduced the Corolla Cross in 2023, filling the gap between the smaller Yaris Cross and the famous Rav4 SUV. Customers' desire for more crossovers and SUVs was the one that made most automakers create either new or upgraded versions for vehicles that could fall into these segments. Toyota was already experienced in creating such cars and noticed that even its smallest crossover, the Yaris Cross, was well-received by the market. So they tried to apply the same recipe to the Corolla lineup by introducing the Corolla Cross in 2023. From a standpoint, the vehicle looked like it was a shrunk Rav4. Its wide and narrow headlights flanked the oversized A-shaped grille adorned the front fascia. Its bumper formed another wide A-shape on the lower side and included the fog lights. From its sides, the Corolla Cross revealed the black trims around the wheel arches with matching rocker panels. Finally, at the back, the car received a silver shield under the black bumper and a roof spoiler at the top of the raked-forward tailgate. Inside, Toyota installed a similar design as the rest of the Corolla range, with a floating 10.5"" touchscreen placed atop the center stack and just a few buttons for the climate control unit. Another screen filled the instrument cluster and offered a few personalization options for the driver. The Japanese automaker also added some luxury touches and provided the car with an option for man-made leather upholstery. Beside the front seats, the Corolla Cross featured a bench in the back for three adult-sized passengers. Under the skin, the Corolla Cross featured the same TNGA platform fitted with a front- or an all-wheel drive system. In addition, all versions received the already famous e-CVT gearbox.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Corolla Cross"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""wide"", ""narrow"", ""shrunk"", ""raked-forward"", ""luxury""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""oversized"", ""A-shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""wide"", ""narrow""],    ""bumper"": [""wide"", ""A-shaped"", ""black"", ""silver""],    ""wheel"": [""black trims""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""spoiler"", ""raked-forward""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Mirai,"Toyota pushed the pedal to the metal and accelerated its development process for a complete transition away from fossil fuels. The 2021 Mirai was a good example. The idea of fuel-cell wasn't new, and it was tried and tested by many carmakers such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, or Honda. Toyota developed a platform to be used for various propulsion systems, from hybrid to electric or fuel-cell vehicles. The 2021 Mirai was the last addition and confirmed that Toyota would bring that water-powered vehicle sooner than expected. Since it needed more tanks to store the hydrogen, Toyota used an extended wheelbase version of the Mirai platform to increase the storage capacity. Thus, the car could take up to 5.6 kg (12.3 lbs) of hydrogen, enough for up to 650 km (404 miles). But Toyota designers managed to shape the car in a fastback style, so, at a glance, it didn't look that long. The front fascia featured an impressive lower grille with horizontal lines, while on its upper side, the LED headlights with enclosed daytime running lights mimicked an angry, aggressive face. Inside, a fully digital instrument cluster was continued with a complete infotainment display placed on top of the center stack. The expansive center console hid one of the five hydrogen tanks. Toyota designed the interior for five adult passengers, but the broad and tall center tunnel didn't leave too much room for the middle passenger.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Mirai"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""extended wheelbase"",  ""overall-design"": [""fastback style"", ""impressive front fascia""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""impressive"", ""lower"", ""horizontal lines""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""enclosed daytime running lights""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Hilux Double Cab,"The eighth generation of the Toyota Hilux came on the market with a second facelift in June 2020, after the one introduced in 2017. The Hilux was known for its reliability and trustworthy capabilities. The pick-up won the Dakar rally-raid race, the North Pole, and the Icelandic volcanos. Its rugged chassis and reliable drivetrain made it a great choice for off-roaders as well. The 2020 model came with essential updates at the front fascia with a redesigned grille and LED headlights. From its sides, the 2020 double-cab Hilux featured 18"" light-alloy wheels. It looked more like a lifestyle utility vehicle than a utility truck with that design and stylish exterior elements. In the back, the new LED taillights improved the car's visibility. Inside, Toyota upgraded the Hilux interior with a new design for the dashboard and driving post. On the center stack, an 8"" infotainment unit combined the car's entertainment and other information on the same screen. The enhanced multimedia system featured a new touch-screen and incorporated both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. A JBL sound system was available. Under the hood, Toyota installed a revised 2.8-liter turbodiesel unit. It gained few horses even if it had to comply with the stricter Euro 6d emission regulations. A 6-speed manual was fitted as standard while a 6-speed automatic was on the options list.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Toyota Hilux"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""double-cab"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""reliable"", ""stylish"", ""lifestyle"", ""enhanced""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""redesigned""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""18-inch"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Camry,"The Camry was on its eighth generation in 2021 when Toyota introduced a new hybrid version for its mid-size sedan in the U.S., improving its fuel efficiency even more. Toyota Camry was known as America's favorite mid-size sedan. Besides its reliability and comfortable ride, fuel efficiency was also one of its main qualities. Apart from the inline-four and the V6 engines, the hybrid version proved very appealing to customers, and it has done that since 2006 when the Japanese carmaker introduced a hybrid drivetrain for it. As expected, the 2022 Camry Hybrid shared its bodywork with its non-hybrid Camry sibling. At the front, the wide V-shaped fascia comprised the swept-back headlights and a slim grille with a body-colored trim that supported the chromed badge. In the lower bumper, the carmaker added a trapezoidal-shaped grille. However, unlike the rest of the range, the Camry Hybrid received a set of unique 18"" black wheels and a shark-fin antenna. In addition, it received specific badges, door-mirror caps, and handles. Inside, Toyota offered a choice of 7- or 9"" screens for the infotainment system, mounted atop the center stack in a floating position. Finally, the instrument cluster received a wider TFT display placed between two round dials. The front seats benefited from heating and cooling, while the rear bench was just standard as in any other Camry. Under the hood, the automaker installed the THS II (Toyota Hybrid System II) for the Camry, combining the power of a 2.5-liter four-mill engine and an electric motor. The former provided a maximum of 176 hp while the latter offered 118 hp for a total output of 208 hp. In addition, the entire system was paired with an ECVT that mimicked a six-speed sequential gearbox with paddle shifters behind the steering wheel.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Camry"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""reliable"", ""comfortable"", ""fuel-efficient"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""swept-back""],    ""grille"": [""slim"", ""body-colored"", ""trapezoidal-shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [""wide"", ""lower trapezoidal-shaped""],    ""wheel"": [""unique 18\"" black""],    ""doors"": [""specific badges"", ""body-colored handles""],    ""roof"": [""shark-fin antenna""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Land Cruiser / Prado,"After more than seven decades and ten generations from its first off-roader, Toyota unveiled the 2024 Land Cruiser. In its long journey, the Japanese automaker sold more than 11 million units in more than one hundred countries. These results were achieved thanks to the car's legendary ruggedness and reliability that made Toyota a trustworthy brand, and the Land Cruiser was on top of its food chain. With such heritage behind it, the 2024 Land Cruiser had to prove that it is worthy in an era where most cars were built on unibody platforms and with a high level of electrification. But, somehow, Toyota confirmed that it was up to the task and continued the story for the Land Cruiser with an incredible machine. The Japanese automaker didn't care about aerodynamics too much when it penned the 2024 Land Cruiser. Even though the car featured some shaved corners and curved surfaces, the overall look was boxy. At the front, the front fascia resembled the one installed in the Land Cruiser FJ70, with a slim rim surrounding the grille where the Toyota badge took center stage. An intriguing detail was noticed on the headlights, where the automaker offered customers a choice of two versions. One was with a set of slim LEDs that looked modern, while the other featured round illuminated circles that resembled the predecessor mentioned above of the Land Cruiser. From the profile, the enlarged front fenders covered the chunky off-road wheels and featured plastic molds around the squarish wheel arches. The door mirrors were huge for a 2023 vehicle and were intentionally left black and unpainted. On the rear doors, Toyota created a step-up for the windows' line towards the vertical D-pillar at the back. Like on the front fenders, the rear ones featured plastic moldings and enlarged areas. The automaker kept the back of the SUV unaltered by the spare wheel mounted on the tailgate and installed it underneath the vehicle. Finally, the Land Cruiser 250 featured corner-mounted taillights that flanked the tailgate to keep things traditional. Inside, the Land Cruiser offered room for up to seven people on three rows of seats. The last ones, placed in the trunk area, were jump seats, and both the second and third rows were flat folding to increase the cargo size. Even though the vehicle's overall length decreased compared to its predecessor, the interior room was bigger thanks to the longer wheelbase. As a result, there was enough legroom for the first and second rows and just enough for the third one. But being a tribute to the legendary FJ70 Series, the SUV didn't have to stick to old-style technologies. As a result, the dashboard featured an LCD display fronting the driver and a touchscreen atop the center stack for the infotainment system. A massive center console separated the front seats. It housed the transmission controls, a pair of cup holders, and a storage compartment that also served as an armrest. Technically, the Land Cruiser relied on a ladder frame, with front independent suspension and a rigid axle in the rear. Under the hood, Toyota installed a turbocharged inline-four, helped by an electric motor for a total of 326 HP (330 PS), paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission that sent power in all corners via a two-speed transfer case.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Land Cruiser"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""boxy"", ""rugged"", ""reliable"", ""chunky"", ""traditional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""curved""],    ""grille"": [""slim"", ""front-facing""],    ""hood"": [""boxy""],    ""headlights"": [""slim"", ""round"", ""modern"", ""illuminated""],    ""bumper"": [""front"", ""rear""],    ""wheel"": [""off-road"", ""chunky"", ""squarish""],    ""doors"": [""enlarged"", ""black"", ""unpainted""],    ""roof"": [""longer wheelbase""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Yaris 3 Doors,"Toyota made one of the hottest hatches on the market when it introduced the GR Yaris in 2020, a car built for the road so the carmaker could race it in the World Rally Championship. Rallyes are a different kind of motorsport, with teams and cars running full-speed over bumps, gravel, snow, and tarmac. However, the regulations say that a rally car should be based on a production model and then modified according to specific rules. A carmaker can't build one from scratch and cover it with plastic bodywork that looks like an ordinary car someone could get from a dealer. As a result, automakers started to develop performance road cars that could be transformed according to FIA's (International Motorsport Federation) regulations. But Toyota went even further and built a rally car for ordinary people that they could get from a dealership: the GR Yaris. Unlike the regular Yaris, the GR Yaris featured a three-door hatchback bodywork. In contrast, its normal sibling was exclusively available with five doors. But the specific differences didn't stop here. The car looked far more aggressive with its broad grille mounted in the air dam covering the lower side of its front. In addition, a set of vertical side scoops housed the fog lamps and air intakes that channeled the air toward the brakes. From its profile, bystanders' eyes were attracted by the rear quarter panels like magnets. There, Toyota placed wide wheels and tires and enlarged fenders. The curved and ascending waistline ended up into a kink and a tilted-forward C-pillar. Finally, the back of the vehicle revealed a spoiler atop the tailgate. Underneath the bumper, there was a diffuser and two round pipes. Inside, the car didn't boast luxurious materials. It was hard plastic on the door cards and other areas. The dashboard looked like it was carried over from the regular Yaris but sported a GR-specific instrument cluster with a tachometer marked up to 8,000 rpm and a speedometer marked to 280 kph (174 MPH). The high bolstered bucket seats with integrated headrests featured pass-through gaps for a five-point harness, even though those were not present on the car. In the back was one of the most cramped bench seats in the small-size segment category. That area looked more suitable for carrying the racing overall and the helmet. In terms of practicality, the GR Yaris offered a climate control unit, an infotainment system, and front power windows. But the real reason Toyota made this car was found under the GR Yaris' skin. Under the hood was the punchiest three-cylinder engine on the market. The turbocharged 1.6-liter powerplant was squeezed to provide 261 HP (257 PS), which it sent in all corners via a six-speed manual only. The all-wheel-drive system could send all the power to the front or to the rear axle. In addition, the driver could alter settings and get an even or a rear-biased torque distribution. Toyota built just 25,000 units of this and sold them all in less than a year.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""GR Yaris"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""sporty"", ""rally-inspired""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad""],    ""hood"": [""air dam""],    ""headlights"": [""vertical side scoops""],    ""bumper"": [""diffuser"", ""wide""],    ""wheel"": [""wide""],    ""doors"": [""three-door""],    ""roof"": [""curved"", ""ascending""],    ""diffusor"": [""underneath the bumper""],    ""spoiler"": [""atop the tailgate""],    ""exhaust"": [""two round pipes""]  }}```"
TOYOTA Sienna,"Toyota made the Sienna as a family carrier, and, in 2020, it unveiled the fourth minivan built for the North-American market. The Sienna was planned to be unveiled at the 2020 New York International Auto Show, but due to the world COVID-19 pandemic, the show was canceled. The Japanese car-maker didn't give up and unveiled it online in May 2020. The minivan was based on the Toyota TNGA-K platform (Toyota New Global Architecture-K) used for the Highlander range. But that didn't transform the MPV into an SUV. The exterior design was not one of the best in class, nor best in Toyota's lineup. The front apron featured a grille so prominent that it almost covered it. There were only a few areas that were untouched by the horizontal slats. Above the bumper, the slim headlights, which might have fit better on a Camry, featured the daytime running lights. The greenhouse featured a slightly sloped roof and two thick, D-pillars in the back. The tailgate looked like the Corolla station-wagon inspired it. The sculptured door panels and rear fenders made the car a little bit more appealing on the sides. The interior was the one that stood out with its three-row seating position. The ceiling was the mounting area for the rear infotainment system, so the back's kids won't get too bored before reaching the destination. The trunk was big, mostly if the third row was not in use. The Sienna was fitted with only one powertrain: the hybrid system. It was powered by a 2.5-liter Atkinson engine and an electric motor. Both were mated to a CVT gearbox.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Sienna"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""MPV"",  ""overall-design"": [""family carrier"", ""slightly sloped roof"", ""sculptured door panels"", ""three-row seating"", ""hybrid system""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""slightly sloped""],    ""grille"": [""prominent"", ""horizontal slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""slim"", ""daytime running lights""],    ""bumper"": [""front apron""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured panels""],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Yaris 5 Doors,"Toyota introduced the fourth generation of the Yaris in late 2019 simultaneously in Japan and Europe, and unlike its predecessors, it was available only as a five-door hatchback. Still, a high-performance three-door version came later and was known as the GR Yaris. Right before the pandemic struck the world and forced everybody to lock themselves inside their homes, Toyota introduced the fourth generation of the successful model Yaris. The car was already known for its reliability. In addition, it was a user-friendly vehicle, and Toyota managed to keep these attributes on the 2020 Yaris. This was one of the reasons why the Japanese automaker made the vehicle with five doors. It noticed that this bodywork version was in high demand on its predecessor, so it decided to slash the three-door option. As a result, it could keep production costs down while still offering plenty of features and amenities. With a design that didn’t want to scare anyone on the road, the 2020 Yaris came clean in front of its customers with swept-back headlights and a massive front bumper that incorporated the broad, trapezoidal-shaped grille. In addition, Toyota installed a set of scoops on the sides of the front apron where it placed the fog lamps, which were on the options list. Otherwise, those were filled with fake air intakes. From its profile, depending on the grades, the Yaris sported body-colored door mirrors and door handles. The sculptured doors created the image of a three-door vehicle since the rear ones were shorter and sported a raised rear area that emerged onto the C-pillars. At the back, the carmaker made the car with a tilted-forward tailgate adorned with a roof spoiler. Inside, Toyota created a modern interior with a large screen for the infotainment system placed atop the center stack. In front of the driver, installed a mixed instrument cluster that featured large dials for the tachometer and the rev counter and, between them, an LCD for additional data provided by the car’s onboard computer. Depending on trims and options, customers could get the car with power windows and air-conditioning. Furthermore, a powerful sound system was also on the options list. The bucket seats didn’t provide excellent side support, but they were comfortable despite their high-mounted position. In the back, the car manufacturer placed a split-folding (60/40) bench seat where two adults could sit comfortably. Still, for short jaunts, a third passenger could sit in the middle, but with limited legroom. The trunk featured a flat floor, but the overall volume was unimpressive. Under the hood, the fourth generation of the Yaris came fitted with either gasoline-only or electrified versions. Surprisingly, it even offered the option for an automatic transmission (eCVT), but the base model sent its power to the front wheels via a six-speed manual.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Yaris"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""reliable"", ""user-friendly"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""swept-back""],    ""grille"": [""trapezoidal-shaped""],    ""hood"": [""massive""],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back""],    ""bumper"": [""massive"", ""front""],    ""wheel"": [""body-colored""],    ""doors"": [""sculptured"", ""shorter rear""],    ""roof"": [""tilted-forward"", ""adorned with a spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Avalon,"The latest generation of the Toyota Avalon TRD comes with a 3.5-liter v6 engine that develops 301 hp and 267 lb-ft of torque. The TRD version includes all standard content from the Camry SE grade and Avalon XSE grade and is visually enhanced. The car has a more aerodynamic-looking body, including an eye-catching front splitter, side aero skirts, trunk lid spoiler, and rear diffuser, together with the available colors in Supersonic Red, Windchill Pearl, Celestial Silver Metallic and Midnight Black Metallic, all of which asserting a bold stance, matching the sporty dynamics of the vehicle. Thicker underbody braces are maximizing the torsional rigidity and unique coil springs lower the vehicle by 0.6 inches for a reduced center of gravity compared with the regular Camry. Specially tuned shock absorbers and 19 x 8.5-inch matte black alloy wheels create a suspension package that improves body control, handling agility, and steering precision. Toyota also equips the Avalon TRD with Black Sport SofTex-trimmed heated front seats, with Ultra-suede inserts and red accents. Additionally, the car comes with red-stitched TRD embroidered headrests, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with red stitching, red seatbelts and standard Toyota Safety Sense-P, a suite of advanced driver-assist technologies, among these Pre-Collision Braking, making it a reliable car.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Toyota Avalon TRD"",  ""year"": ""latest generation"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""aerodynamic"", ""sporty"", ""bold"", ""eye-catching"", ""reliable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""matte black"", ""19-inch""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""rear""],    ""spoiler"": [""trunk lid""],    ""exhaust"": [""N/A""]  }}```"
TOYOTA Highlander / Kluger,"The biggest Highlander ever made by Toyota made its world debut at the 2019 New York Auto Show, promising gas and hybrid versions into the upcoming year. But the most important thing is that the unibody SUV is built on a completely new platform. The new platform, called TNGA-K (Toyota New Global Architecture) allows multiple choices of engines, gearboxes and bodyworks. It will have four trim levels: LE, XLE, Limited and the top of the line Platinum. Customers can choose between 5 or 7 seats on most of the versions. On the inside, Toyota kept their promise of introducing a new 12.3” touch-screen for the top Platinum trim and 8” for the other. As expected, all the infotainment systems are supporting Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The rear doors are wide enough to ensure a comfortable entry for the passengers on the third row. Under the hood, Toyota installed the well-known 3.5-liter direct gas injection V6 engine with 295 HP. For the hybrid version, the Japanese engineers installed a four cylinder 2.5-liter unit and two electric motors. Unlike before, Toyota installed these motors transaxle on the rear, with a parallel design.

TOYOTA Auris 5 Doors,"Auris was born as the hatchback version of the Corolla, and by 2018, it had already reached its third generation, which was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show. Toyota pushed its electrification program further and introduced the third generation of the Auris with a wider choice of electrified models. It didn't rely only on fuel efficiency but also on performance. Thus, customers who were reluctant to switch to hybrids had something that attracted them more. In addition, the conventional engine-only versions were still kept under production, thus helping the carmaker to sell them for a lower price than the hybrid versions. The Auris was clearly designed to address the younger generation. It featured a front fascia with narrow headlights and a shape that resembled a pair of fangs. Moreover, the lower bumper featured a trapezoidal-shaped grille that covered most of the lower apron. Thus, the car's look was very aggressive. From its profile, the hatchback's beltline was raised on the rear doors and connected to the raked-forward C-pillars. In addition, the two-tone bodywork, with a contrasting greenhouse available as an option, amplified the car's sporty look. Inside, Toyota packed the Auris with its latest technologies. It started with introducing a digital instrument cluster and continued with the touchscreen infotainment system placed atop the center stack. The sport bucket seats at the front were also comfortable, but they were high-mounted, which helped the rear passengers' legroom. At the back, the split-folding bench allowed three adults to sit there, but not for long trips. Under the hood, besides the three internal-combustion engine-only versions, Toyota added a choice of two hybrid drivetrains. One was carried over from the Prius and provided a very good fuel efficiency, while the other was punchier, with an under eight-seconds time for the 0-62 mph (0-100 kph) run.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Auris"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""Hatchback"",  ""overall-design"": [""Aggressive"", ""Sporty"", ""Youthful"", ""Two-tone bodywork"", ""Comfortable interior""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""Narrow""],    ""grille"": [""Trapezoidal-shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""Narrow""],    ""bumper"": [""Lower"", ""Trapezoidal-shaped""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""Raised beltline"", ""Raked-forward C-pillars""],    ""roof"": [""Contrasting greenhouse""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA RAV4 5 Doors,"Toyota dropped the anonymity design from the Rav4 when it introduced the fifth generation of its compact SUV model at the 2018 New York Auto Show. When the SUV sales started to rise, Toyota already had the first generation of the Rav4 on the market. Its well-known experience in the 4x4 segment and the trustworthy models transformed it into a best-seller worldwide. The car's only drawback was its modest design, not bold enough for what the car was capable of. But that changed with the fifth generation. The five-door Rav-4 featured an angular design at the front, with swept-back headlights and multi-stage A-shapes on the bumper and grille. Maybe the car designer responsible for that was a Darth Vader fan. On the sides, the sculptured door panels and enlarged wheel fenders reminded the customers that the carmaker was a capable 4x4 maker. In the back, the Rav-4 dropped the flat rear end and offered a raked-forward C-pillar and windscreen. Inside, the carmaker continued the wedged shapes and, apart from the round steering wheel and climate control dials, all the dashboard lines were angular. A floating touch-screen display adorned the top of the center stack and featured the Toyota Entune 3.0 system. The front bucket seats separated by a tall center console were designed for comfortable rides, while in the back, the carmaker installed 60/40 split-folding seats with a lower center tunnel. Under the hood, the carmaker introduced one gasoline engine and three hybrid versions paired either with an eight-speed automatic or a CVT.

TOYOTA Aygo 5 Doors,"Designed as a city car, the Aygo was redesigned for 2018. The small vehicle built in the Czech Republic competed with the VW Up and the i10, however, it looked the most fun if you ask me. Available in a 3-door or a 5-door configuration, the Aygo was a very light vehicle with its weight below 1000 kg. The redesigned front kept the X shape, and added more 3D effect. The side of the Aygo gave the impression of a flying roof. At the back, the iconic shape was kept, however, the taillights were refreshed. The Aygo came with standard 15-inch aluminum wheels that had a funky design. One engine variant was available for the Aygo, a 1.0-liter 3-cylinder engine that developed 72 hp, 3 hp more than the previous model. The engine was mated to either a manual or an automatic gearbox. The Aygo’s cabin was mostly made with hard plastics that had a good finish, not giving the impression of a cheap car, even if it was not an expensive vehicle. The interior was rather retro-funky, with some elements fitting the car’s exterior color. The nice looking fabric seats had integrated head restraints, more like in a sportier car. The steering wheel was height-adjustable only and it moved with the cluster as well. Optionally, a foldable roof with a wide opening could be added to the package. The Aygo was equipped with keyless entry, Apple CarPlay, USB ports, a 12V power outlet and an optional rear-view camera.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Aygo"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""fun"", ""light"", ""iconic"", ""retro-funky"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""redesigned"", ""3D""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""refreshed""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""15-inch"", ""aluminum"", ""funky""],    ""doors"": [""3-door"", ""5-door""],    ""roof"": [""flying""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Corolla,"The Corolla was one of the best selling vehicles in the world since the nameplate's launch in 1966. In 2012, Toyota introduced the eleventh generation, which refreshed in 2016 for the U.S. market. Toyota released the facelift for their home-market in April 2015, but it took them another two years to reach U.S. soil. In 2017, the compact sedan was already the best-selling vehicle in its class, and it did that for a reason. Its high-reliability index and the low costs of ownership made it looks like a bargain. For the facelifted version, Toyota changed a few things about the car, and the result was a safer, better-looking vehicle. The Corolla featured new LED driving lights that looked like sharp teeth at the front on the outside. A bigger, wider grille found its place on the lower side of the bumper, while the regular grille from above was slimmer. It looked like Toyota designers wants to get rid of that part. The headlights were changed and received LED or bi-LED lamps depending on the trim level. Toyota installed 16"" light-alloy-wheels as standard on the LE and XLE versions, while the SE and XE received a set of 17"" wheels. Inside, Toyota improved the cabin with new features such as the new infotainment system, with a 7"" touch-screen installed above the center stack. But the biggest change was on the safety systems side, where the carmaker installed a full pack of features such as lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, or automatic braking system. Under the hood, Toyota dropped a 1.8-liter unit paired to a 6-speed manual for the base model, or a CVT for the others. With eight hp more, an eco version was on the options list and returned a slightly better fuel-efficiency.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Corolla"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""safer"", ""better-looking"", ""reliable"", ""low-cost"", ""bargain""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""bigger"", ""wider"", ""slimmer""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""bi-LED"", ""sharp""],    ""bumper"": [""lower"", ""changed""],    ""wheel"": [""16-inch"", ""17-inch"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Yaris Sedan,"Toyota cared to make a three-box sedan version for its small-segment vehicle, the Yaris. But the surprises didn't stop there. When Toyota offered the Yaris sedan for several emerging markets was no surprise. But when it offered it to the North American customers, the surprise was twice as much, especially since the car was a re-badged Mazda 2 with a different shape. From the outside, only the headlights might give a clue that under that bodywork was a Mazda 2 vehicle. At the front, the huge grille from the lower side of the bumper reminded us of the ""Jaws"" movie, while the two sculptured lines from its sides might remind you of the Storm Troopers masks. From its sides, the Yaris Sedan featured a curved beltline, like a waved line from headlights to taillights. The Japanese designers from Mazda did a good job of that. Inside, it was a Mazda 2 from top to bottom, except for a few Toyota badges on the interior. Depending on the trim level, the carmaker installed an infotainment screen on top of the center stack. Its display was not touch-sensitive, and it was controlled via a rotary knob placed between the front seats. Under the hood, Toyota offered the Sedan version with only one engine option: a 1.6-liter gasoline unit. It was paired as standard to a 6-speed manual, while a 6-speed automatic was on the options list.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Yaris"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""three-box sedan"", ""curved beltline"", ""sculptured lines"", ""waved line"", ""surprising""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""huge"", ""lower side"", ""Jaws movie""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""only clue"", ""different shape""],    ""bumper"": [""sculptured"", ""huge grille""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Prius C (Aqua),"Toyota tried to make a more affordable version of the Prius and introduced the Prius C in 2012, which was updated in 2015 and 2017. The Japanese carmaker was the starter of the hybrid revolution. While in the beginning, it was the only offer on the market, later on, more and more brands joined the trend, but Toyota kept trying to stay ahead. To compete against cheaper options, it built the Prius C, a more affordable car to buy, and offered one of the best fuel efficiencies on the market. With the 2017 facelift, the carmaker brought a new front bumper and different headlights. Toyota removed the daytime running lights from the bumper's side scoops, which they shared the space with the fog lights, and migrated inside the headlamps. On the sides, the carmaker installed black plastic moldings around the wheel arches, where it fitted standard 175/65R15 tires. For Toyota, it wasn't easy to cut costs and still kept the same quality standards. The carmaker chose to use lower quality plastics inside the cabin but kept the same up-market infotainment systems and the same drivetrain as in the regular Prius. For the 2018 model, the Prius C featured a standard backup camera for the entire range. Under the hood, Toyota installed the same 1.5-liter engine and an electric motor plus a 0.9 kW NiMh battery pack as its predecessor. It was a cheaper but trustworthy solution. After all, all it mattered was the fuel efficiency, and with an average of 46 mpg (5.1 l/100 km), the Prius C was one of the best offers in its class.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Prius C"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""affordable"", ""fuel-efficient"", ""facelifted"", ""trustworthy"", ""compact""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""new front bumper""],    ""headlights"": [""different"", ""migrated inside""],    ""bumper"": [""new front bumper"", ""removed daytime running lights""],    ""wheel"": [""standard 175/65R15 tires""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Tundra,"Toyota introduced a completely new Tundra in 2021, after 14 years since the launch of this pickup's predecessor, in 2007, and the seven since the refreshed 2014 model. The full-size pickup segment is highly competitive in the U.S. market. So Toyota tried hard to convince American customers to ditch the Silverados, the F-150s, the RAMs, or the other Japanese contender, Nissan Titan. Tundra's sales results were not bad, but it never gained the same image as the local manufacturers. Its rugged appearance is backed up by a redesigned chassis and a proven sturdiness. Toyota designed, engineered, and tested the 2021 Tundra in U.S. Gone were its predecessors' soft lines and curved panels. Instead, the front fascia features a flat, broad grille, which looked more like a barbwire fence, or gate, than a car's grille. For the interior, Toyota understood that it couldn't compete with the same rugged appearance of its predecessors. It offered the Tundra in six trim levels, ranging from SR5 up to the 1794 limited edition. With the 2021 model year, the customers could enjoy a luxurious cabin adorned by leather upholstery and a 14"" infotainment screen that sat atop the center stack. But the most essential change was on the car's platform. It featured coil springs in the back, ditching the leaf springs. It could still handle 1,950 lbs (884 kg) and tow up to 12,000 lbs (5,443 kg). Under the hood, there was only a twin-turbo V6 powerplant that offered 348 hp for the SR5 version. At the same time, the other options were 389 horses and a hybrid version that provided a combined output of 437 horses and 583 lb-ft (790 Nm) of torque. All versions were paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission and sent the power in all four corners.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Tundra"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""full-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""sturdy"", ""luxurious"", ""flat grille"", ""broad grille""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""flat"", ""broad"", ""rugged""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Venza,"The Venza's second generation was unveiled online in April 2020 due to the world COVID-19 pandemic and went on sales in June. While the first generation was more of a minivan, related to the Camry, the second generation took a different approach and was tied closely to the Highlander SUV. But it wasn't a completely new vehicle. It was a Japanese Toyota Harrier that landed on the U.S. Soil. Regardless of who it was related to or where it came from, the Venza featured an advanced design for its era. The slim headlights placed on top of the front fascia and a vast grille integrated into the bumper were the main differences compared to the general trend in automotive design. The SUV-coupe stance, with a sloped-back and raised rear shoulders over the quarter panels, giving the car a dynamic look. More features followed inside the car, where a classic, analog instrument cluster was paired to a big, 12.5"" touch-screen display mounted on top of the center stack. The standard version featured an 8"" display. The rest of the dashboard featured a minimalist design, with only a line that visually divided it into an upper and lower area. On the center console, the carmaker installed only the gear-selector and two cup-holders. The rear room was bigger than the one offered on the Toyota C-HR, which was good news. Under the hood, Toyota installed a single drivetrain. The 2.5-liter Atkinson cycle gasoline engine paired with an electric motor and both connected to a CVT gearbox. It was the same powerplant from the Rav4 Hybrid or the Lexus NX. All versions featured an all-wheel-drive system.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Venza"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""SUV-coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""advanced"", ""dynamic"", ""minimalist""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""vast""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""slim""],    ""bumper"": [""integrated""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloped-back"", ""raised rear shoulders""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA GT 86,"After the Scion brand failed to get enough of the market, the sporty little coupe Scion FRS had to be axed too. But the car was replaced with the 2017 Toyota GT86. And it was a better deal. The 2016 Toyota GT86 had some outside details upgrades even if they were not so obvious. The car had LED only lights outside the vehicle: headlights, DRL, fog-lights and, of course, taillights. On the side of the headlights, a GT86 logo was shown. On the front fenders, the engineers installed air-vents that sucked the air from the wheel-well to decrease the lift on higher speeds. A new light-alloy set of wheels were introduced. Inside, there was the same interior, but with better materials than those found in the FRS. On the 2017 Toyota GT86, the bucket seats had Alcantara upholstery. The most important modifications were on the tech side. Under the hood, if the air intakes were red, the transmission was manual. If those were black than it was an automatic. Both gearboxes had 6 speeds and the automatic also had paddle-shifters behind the steering wheel. The power was increased by 2.5% by optimizing the airflow of the flat-4 naturally aspirated engine. The suspension was stiffer on the front and softer on the rear, for a neutral behavior of the car. Some bushings and strut-bars were also modified so the whole body was stiffer. In the end, the GT86 was more of a handling car.

TOYOTA Corolla (US),"The new generation of the Corolla had a gorgeous exterior design with nice lines that made it look more expensive than it actually was. The new model came with more technology, efficiency and became more fun to drive than the previous Corolla. LED headlights were included regardless of the trim level, as well as auto high beam lights. The Corolla was available in 6 trim levels: L, LE, LE Eco, SE, XSE and XLE. The 2018 Corolla was driven by a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine that produced 132 hp and 128 pound-feet of torque. The LE Eco provided 140 hp. The engines were mated with a continuously variable automatic transmission, and optionally, a 6-speed manual available for the SE trim level only. The base model was greatly equipped and included 15-inch steel wheels, LED running lights, adaptive cruise control, a 6.1-touchscreen and a 6-speaker audio system with an USB port. The safety features included a rearview camera, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection and lane departure warning with steering assist. The LE Eco added the 16-inch steels, heated mirrors, upgraded upholstery and automatic climate control (all features specific to the LE) and a more powerful engine with a tuned suspension and improved aerodynamics. The XLE added a sunroof, keyless entry and ignition, leather-like upholstery, heated front seats and a bigger touchscreen display, all to enhance comfort.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Corolla"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""gorgeous exterior design"", ""nice lines"", ""expensive look""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED headlights"", ""auto high beam lights""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""15-inch steel wheels"", ""16-inch steel wheels""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sunroof""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Prius v/Prius+,"The Prius + was introduced in 2011 as an MPV based on the Toyota Prius platform. Just four years later, it received a mild facelift to keep its sales up. It was also named Prius V. The V in the name stands for Versatility and it was added to emphasize that the car could carry up to seven passengers. The heightened and extended roof made room for the third row of seats, where two not-so-big adults could sit. It was also good for carrying five adults and more luggage. The 2015 model received some stylistic changes to the front and rear of the car. The car was fitted with the new LED headlights from Toyota, for both low and high-beam. They looked angrier. The fog lights were integrated into the bumper's new grille. In the back, the taillights received a new design, with red and clear lenses. Inside, the Prius V received a new, 4.2” TFT display between the gauges, depending on the trim level. For the roof, the car was fitted with an option for a resin Panoramic View Moonroof with power retractable sunshades. It was 40-percent lighter than a conventional glass roof of a similar size. The standard audio system was upgraded to the latest version of the Toyota Entune Audio, with a 6.1” touch-screen on the center stack. The 2015 Prius V kept the same powertrain as before, with a 1.8-liter dual VVTI Atkinson cycle engine and an electric motor.

TOYOTA Fortuner,"When your name is Toyota and you have one of the best pickups in the world, you can slam an SUV bodywork on that chassis and call it a day. Just name it Fortuner (not For Tuner) and sell it well. In the past, most of the SUVs were capable 4x4 vehicles which could go virtually anywhere. Since they were body-on-frame system, with separate chassis, all the modifications needed were easier to do. But that doesn't work with the unibody construction on the modern SUVs that usually cannot tackle more than a dirt road. The Fortuner is one of the vehicles that was built ""old school"" but with a modern design in 2015. The second generation of the large SUV applied the same recipe as the previous: took the chassis from the Hilux pickup and slammed a bodywork on it. The design had some similarities in the design concept with the Toyota Corolla, mostly on the headlight shape. On the side, there was a strange descending line from the C-pillar to the rear. The idea was to make the car look better, not bald. And the result is fine. Inside, there was room for up to seven passengers and still had some trunk space. The dashboard design was very interesting, with a display in the middle and a big touch-screen display on the central console. The instrument cluster was a mix of round analog dials and a small display for the on-board computer.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Fortuner"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""large"",  ""overall-design"": [""modern"", ""spacious"", ""rugged""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""slammed"", ""modern""],    ""headlights"": [""similar to Corolla""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""strange descending line""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Avensis Wagon,"The upgraded Avensis differed a lots from the model it replaced, offering two new engines borrowed from BMW. The exterior design was refreshed, all the panels were new and LED running lights were included. While it was built on the same platform, the interior was redesigned. The cockpit looked familiar, but slightly changed with tunnel dials and an LED coloured display with several functions including safety features and sat-nav. The biggest 8-inch touchscreen display could be controlled by touching, of course, and by using the physical buttons. The center console was also refreshed, still offering the same single cup holder and another cupholder placed under the armrest, not the most efficient place to mount it if you ask me. The plastics used were of good quality, however, easily scratchable. The rear seats passengers could easily enjoy journey with the decent legroom and headroom, as well as a child in the middle seat would be comfortable due to the flat floor in the middle. With great room for passengers and a decent cargo space, the Avensis also had a good fuel consumption. As it was designed for mostly motorway journeys, the Avensis could take 5 L/100 km. Not bad at all!",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Avensis"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""mid-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed exterior"", ""redesigned interior"", ""efficient layout""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED running lights""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Hilux Extra Cab,"The HiLux was one of the most appreciated pickup-trucks in the world for more than half of the century. In 2015, Toyota introduced the eighth generation of the light-utility off-road vehicle. The recipe for a pickup-truck was quite simple: a bed to load, a cabin to host the driver and its passengers, and an engine in the front. To make it better in off-road conditions, a transfer box and a low range gear completed the main ingredients. The HiLux ticked all the boxes and was offered with a few cab choices. The HiLux was the best selling pickup-truck in Australia for more than a decade and the 2015 model was brought to keep that sales figures up. It was offered as a single-cab, Extra Cab, and Full-size Cab with four conventional doors. The front end design receives new headlights and a lifted bumper in the front, with two horizontal slats on the grille. The short cabin provided extra room for the bed, where longer items could have been loaded. The Extra Cab provided a pair of jump-seats in the back, and a pair of half-size suicide doors. But don't expect some comfort for those two places. The extra space in the cabin was a relief for tall drivers, who could tilt their seats backward. The dashboard offered an SUV-like design, with better materials and an option for a 7” infotainment system. It didn't have that basic look of the older models. One of the reasons why the HiLux was so successful was its reliability and its ruggedness. For the eighth generation if featured a new ladder chassis, stronger than before. For the 2015 model, the HiLux received a new range of engines, with either a 2.4-liter or a 2.8-liter turbodiesel unit. The older 3.0D4-D was retired.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""HiLux"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""light-utility off-road vehicle"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""reliable"", ""off-road capable"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""horizontal slats""],    ""hood"": [""lifted""],    ""headlights"": [""new""],    ""bumper"": [""lifted""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""conventional"", ""half-size suicide""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA 4Runner,"Toyota introduced the fourth generation of the 4Runner truck-based SUV on the market in 2009, and four years later, it upgraded it for the 2014 model year with a substantial facelift. While most other competitors started to morph their SUVs from body-on-frame to monocoque solutions, Toyota kept its 4Runner lineup based on a sturdy ladder-frame chassis for competent off-road situations. But that didn’t mean it was like a utility vehicle on the interior. It was just a rugged, seven-seat family car that could take everybody, and a trailer attached behind, to remote areas and bring them back to cities. Moreover, the automaker kept things civilized and user-friendly. The rugged look of the 4Runner’s fourth generation made many people fall in love with it. Despite struggling with the world financial crisis from 2008-2010, the vehicle’s sales started to bounce back again. Toyota made some changes to the exterior, where the 4Runner got a new grille with chromed surroundings for the Limited trim level. The headlights kept their shapes but got projector beams instead of regular halogen lamps for the entire range. In addition, the taillights were fitted with LEDs. Toyota offered the 2014 4Runner in three trim levels: SR5, Trail, and Limited, and the middle grade was the only one that didn’t receive the seven-seat option. On the dashboard, the first two levels could be optioned with a 6.5” infotainment unit running Toyota’s Entune system that featured GPS navigation. This was standard for the Limited trim level and offered as an option for the SR5 and Trail. This system allowed for music streaming via Bluetooth from mobile phones. The wide, rugged dials for the climate control unit and other buttons allowed customers to use them with gloves on. Fronting the driver was a new instrument cluster with backlit illumination named Optitron. The automaker kept the same seating formula as on the non-facelifted model, with higher front seats and a lower-mounted middle row. The third row, when optioned, was in the trunk and was mostly for kids. With all the seats up, the trunk offered just 9 cu-ft (255 liters) of space, but with the third row folded down, there were 46.3 cu-ft (1,311 liters) available. By keeping just the front seats in place, the 4Runner morphed into a small utility vehicle with a total capacity of 89.5 cu-ft (2,534 liters) of luggage space. The 2014 model year was available with just one engine, the four-liter V6 powerplant that was offered as an option on the previous model. Its power was sent to the rear or in all corners via a five-speed automatic transmission. Toyota offered the SR5 with standard rear-wheel-drive but included the part-time 4WD as an option. For the Trail grade, this system was standard, and for the Limited, Toyota installed a full-time all-wheel-drive at no extra cost. Thanks to the independent, double-wishbone front suspension and the five-link axle in the back, the 4Runner was comfy, and it used gas-filled shock absorbers and coil springs in all corners.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""4Runner"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": ""mid-size SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""civilized"", ""user-friendly"", ""wide"", ""spacious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""new"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""projector"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Avensis,"A new Toyota Avensis came around in 2015, bringing sharp looks, new engines, and more technology. Extending overall vehicle length by 40mm, the front is a bold, prestigious interpretation of Toyota's Under Priority and Keen Look design language. The interior got a makeover along with adopting more sound insulating materials. A new infotainment unit was fitted with the Toyota Touch 2 system and an 8"" multimedia screen. That was better appreciated by private customers. The fleet market represents easily the largest sales base. This is due to the low running costs, which is more important for a company rather than the look or the sharp driving. The new Avensis powertrain line-up has been comprehensively revised, building on the durability and reliability for which it is already renowned to offer customers reductions in fuel consumption, emissions and cost of ownership. There are five engines in the range, and two are diesels. There is a 1.6-liter D-4D and a 2.0-liter D-4D. Their power outputs are 116 hp and 143 hp, respectively. The performance is not mind-blowing. The smaller unit can do a 0 to 100 kph (0-62 mph) sprint in 11.4 seconds, while the latter can achieve a 9.5 seconds time for the same test. But the fuel consumption was rewarding. The 1.6-liter could obtain a 4.1 liter/100 km (57.4 mpg US) while the latter could get a 4.5 liter/100 km.

TOYOTA Hilux,"Toyota took a shortcut when it tried to offer a rugged SUV for the countries where the roads were bad, unpaved, and muddy. Thus, a body-on-frame vehicle built on top of a Hilux just made more sense than developing a completely new vehicle from the ground up. Toyota was reckoned as one of the most reliable vehicles worldwide, and in many countries was already considered a luxurious vehicle. To keep its customers close, the Japanese carmaker installed a new bodywork on top of a Hilux chassis, leading to the Fortuner, or the SW4 as it was named in several markets. While the front end featured some elements carried over from the Hilux, such as the headlights and the one-slat grille, the rest of the vehicle was a completely different story. Its raked windshield led the way to a sporty-looking cabin. The car's dynamic look was emphasized by the raked-forward C-pillars and the darkened real pillars that flanked the tailgate. Depending on the options, the cabin received either a fabric or a leather-wrapped interior. Its dashboard was made from hard plastic, resembling the one installed in the Hilux pickup. Its front seats offered enough space for two passengers that had to share the same center armrest. On the center stack, Toyota installed the HVAC controls and the audio system. In the back, the carmaker offered a better bench than the one found in a regular Hilux. Moreover, despite the transmission tunnel, the SW4 provided enough room for three passengers and still got a decently-sized trunk. Under the hood, Toyota installed a wide engine range, depending on the market and the model year. It started with a 2.5-liter gasoline engine and went all the way to a 4.0-liter powerplant. Moreover, a 3.0-liter turbo-diesel version was available.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Fortuner"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""wide"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""sporty"", ""dynamic"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [""one-slat""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""carried over""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""leather-wrapped""],    ""roof"": [""raked-forward""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Previa / Estima,"The Previa was one of the strangest MPV on the market, with seating for seven, a front-mid engine and rear-wheel-drive. The third generation was launched in 2006 as a 2007 model with a different approach. While the Europeans looked more for the European brands if they wanted an MPV, in other parts of the world the Previa/Estima had a different impact on the market. For their home-market in Japan, the JDM spec was offered even with a hybrid drive. The outside look was made to fit into the main Toyota brand image, with a large V-shaped grille and headlights. The overall look was kept from the second Previa generation, but more stylish. Angular shaped and with flat curved surfaces, the car looked more like an Edge-design era, a trend that was already gone in 2007. Inside, there were more options for the number of seats and the way those were placed. The last seat row could have been folded and stored under the flat floor. Thus, the middle row could have been moved back and created more legroom. The rear sliding doors were electrically powered, as an option, or standard depending on the trim level. The instrument cluster was particularly interesting, with analog dials but placed further back on the dashboard. The 3D appearance was not a usual design for the dashboards, but it worked well on the Estima.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Previa"",  ""year"": ""2007"",  ""size"": ""MPV"",  ""overall-design"": [""stylish"", ""angular-shaped"", ""V-shaped grille"", ""flat curved surfaces"", ""3D appearance""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""large"", ""V-shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""stylish""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""rear sliding"", ""electrically powered""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Supra,"The 2019 Toyota Supra was one of the most awaited sports cars of the year. It wasn't only the glorious history of the car, but also because it had a BMW engine in it. The 2019 Supra was the fifth-generation of the famous Japanese sports car that evolved from another famous Toyota: the Celica. The first generation was named Celica Supra. Over time, the two models evolved in different ways. The Celica went for the rally and the Supra went for street and track use. The fourth-generation featured a famous engine, code 2JZ, which was loved by the tuners community and was modified to obtain over 1000 hp. But that was a time when the CO2 emissions were not measured and counted. In 2019, the fifth-generation Supra was unveiled as a coupe-only model. Its predecessor had a targa version but that was not the case anymore. The Supra featured a very aggressive design with a sharp nose and headlights. The manufacturer said that no line was traced without an aerodynamic study and everything on the car was functional. All the vents and fins were installed to work. Inside, there were many parts and units that showed a link with the BMW. The infotainment system was a carry-over from the German car-maker, but with different software installed. For the technical part, both cars used the same inline-six, twin-turbo BMW engine mated to the same 8-speed automatic transmission. In the rear, the limited-slip differential was a standard fit for the Supra.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Toyota Supra"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""aerodynamic"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""sharp""],    ""headlights"": [""sharp""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""rear"", ""limited-slip""]  }}```"
TOYOTA GR 86,"Toyota introduced the Toyota GR 86 in 2021 and improved the car in all areas while it kept a similar look as the GT 86 sports car. Designed and engineered together with Subaru, the GR 86 made its entrance in style at the 2021 Goodwood Festival of Speed. It proves that the new version could provide what its predecessor lacked: speed and power. With its long hood and short, swept-back cabin, the GR 86 retained the same image introduced by Toyota 2000GT in 1967. At the front, the menacing headlights above the aerodynamically profiled bumper, with a broad grille on the apron, received two side scoops that channeled the air into the wheel wells to cool the front discs. From its sides, the widened front fenders received slim and tall vents to extract that extra air trapped behind the wheels. The car’s muscular lines were emphasized by the “shoulders” over the rear fenders, while at a duck-tail enhanced the tailgate’s look. Inside, the most important upgrade was the 7” TFT multi-information display placed inside the instrument cluster. Designed with analog-looking dials, this will provide a few layouts. For the track mode, the tachometer took center stage, while in other driving modes, the speedometer was in the middle. Like on its predecessor, the GR 86 featured high-bolstered seats, ideal for high-speed cornering. Technologically, the GR 86 featured aluminum roof and front fenders. Thus, the car had a 53:47 weight distribution. The Gazoo Racing engineers stiffened the car with diagonal cross members on the front suspension and a full-ring structure to the rear. Under the hood, Toyota installed the Subaru-sourced engine enlarged to a 2.4-liter displacement thanks to a larger bore. For track-oriented customers, the carmaker offered the GR 86 with a six-speed manual, while an automatic transmission with paddle-shifters was on the options list.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Toyota GR 86"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sleek"", ""muscular"", ""aerodynamic"", ""sporty"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""swept-back""],    ""grille"": [""broad""],    ""hood"": [""long""],    ""headlights"": [""menacing""],    ""bumper"": [""aerodynamically profiled""],    ""wheel"": [""wide"", ""vented""],    ""doors"": [""high-bolstered""],    ""roof"": [""aluminum""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""duck-tail""],    ""exhaust"": [""track-oriented""]  }}```"
TOYOTA GR Supra,"Toyota introduced a new version for the fifth generation of the Supra sports car in 2022 and used the already famous GR letters for it. Gazoo Racing is the official developer for Toyota's racing cars around the world. But after they were done updating and preparing those vehicles, the engineers from GR received other tasks such as creating a sportier version for the Yaris and the Supra. Many Toyota fans were enraged by the fifth generation of the Supra since it shared many components, including the engine, with the Germans from BMW. But on the outside, the two cars couldn't be more different. Moreover, Toyota tried to pen the Supra with the fourth generation in mind. Thus, the long hood, low stance, and sloped-back greenhouse carried on its predecessor styling. None of these were lost or enhanced on the GR version. Still, the Japanese automaker introduced three new colors for it: Moareki Grey, Dawn Blue, and Matte Moonstone White. Inside, the center console had to be revised to make room for the gear stick since the GR Supra was available with a six-speed manual transmission. Moreover, the carmaker added an Alcantara pack for the gear knob and gaiter. But the most important change was under the car's skin. The base engine was a two-liter, turbocharged powerplant good for 252 horses (255 PS) with an option for the already known inline-six, 3.0-liter, and 355 hp (340 PS) version. Both were available with a six-speed manual, while the latter was also provided with an eight-speed automatic.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Supra"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""long hood, low stance"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""sloped-back"", ""different"", ""enhanced"", ""stylish""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""aggressive""],    ""hood"": [""long""],    ""headlights"": [""sleek""],    ""bumper"": [""aerodynamic""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Century SUV,"In 2023, Toyota introduced the Century SUV, and it was more than a premium vehicle; it was a car that redefined the luxury concept in the carmaker's philosophy. The Japanese automaker put a lot of work and effort into developing this vehicle. It placed any high-tech piece of engineering that it had in its basket, and when it didn't have it, it developed it. It was the SUV designed and manufactured for clients obsessed with high-quality materials, fit, and finishes. But still, the exterior design department looked like it took inspiration from other luxurious SUVs. The Century SUV was a statement vehicle. It was big and bold but without being aggressive. At the front, the four LED lamps inside each headlamp were clearly separated. The massive grille at the front was filled with a hexagonal-shaped pattern, and, surprisingly, there was no Toyota badge on it. Instead, the automaker used the Phoenix bird badge that took center stage and reminded customers about the older Century models. Underneath it, on the lower side of the bumper, Toyota installed the rear grille flanked by two side scoops. From its profile, the shaved corners resembled those from the 1967 Toyota Century executive car, while the D-pillars had a similar look to those from the 2018 Century. But one of the most interesting features of the Century was on its rear doors. These were front-hinged but could also slide rearward so passengers could easily ingress and egress from the rear seats. Inside, the automaker installed a so-called Japanese luxury cabin. The vehicle was clearly divided into two distinct areas: for the driver and side passenger and for the rear seats. As expected, the rear ones were the most important. There were two individual seats, which could recline into an almost completely horizontal position, so those seated there could take a nap during their commute or travels around the country. In addition, the side windows were electrochromatic. They could be made opaque so the rear-seat occupants could enjoy more privacy. At the front, the driver faced a massive dashboard filled with an infotainment touchscreen placed atop the center stack and a TFT display for the instrument cluster. The wide center console that separated the front seats housed the transmission gear lever and several other buttons. Like in any other Century model, this SUV didn't show any Toyota badges, and the steering wheel was adorned with the same Phoenix bird. Toyota focused on sustainable solutions and offered the Century SUV with a plug-in hybrid architecture, which allowed the vehicle to roam silently through the streets inside cities and speed up quickly when needed thanks to the gasoline V8 powerplant under the hood. Moreover, the car featured an all-wheel-drive system, which made it capable in slippery road conditions, unpaved surfaces, and light off-road situations.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Century SUV"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""big and bold"",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""luxurious"", ""statement"", ""sustainable"", ""Japanese-inspired""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""hexagonal-shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""four LED"", ""clearly separated""],    ""bumper"": [""rear grille"", ""side scoops""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""front-hinged"", ""rearward sliding""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA GR Corolla,"Toyota unveiled an unexpected contender on the hot-hatch market in 2022 when it unveiled the GR Corolla, a car that shared its DNA with rally cars. Toyota once dominated the World Rally Championship with the Corolla WRC. Unfortunately, they were cheating and got caught. More than two decades later, they revived the hot-hatch version of the famous Corolla family, sharing its underpinnings with the smaller GR Yaris. The Japanese carmaker sold over 50 million units of the Corolla before introducing the hot-hatch version in 2022. The twelfth generation was introduced in 2018, and while most of its versions were bland and just regular vehicles, the GR version was a different kind of animal. Its widened fenders and quarter panels offered an image of a sumo warrior, while the front fascia with the black grille on the apron confirmed that it was not a regular grocery getter. A pair of functional vents behind the front wheel-arches allowed the air trapped inside the wheel-wells to escape and lower the front lift. At the back, a big wing adorned the tailgate, and it was also functional, not just for the look. To complete the image of an aggressive sports car, three exhausts poked through the rear diffuser. Inside, the car took some parts from the regular Corolla, but the Alcantara-upholstered sport seats with high-bolstering were specific for the GR version. The metallic covers for the three pedals setup were also inspired by the motorsports arena. Still, Toyota offered the car with rear seats on a bench, fit for two adults. Under the hood, the GR Corrolla carried over the powerplant from the GR Yaris. The 1.6-liter, turbocharged, three-cylinder unit offered 300 horses on tap, which were sent in all corners via a six-speed manual gearbox, which was the only available option.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""GR Corolla"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""sporty"", ""functional"", ""wide"", ""rally-inspired""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""black""],    ""hood"": [""wide""],    ""headlights"": [""functional""],    ""bumper"": [""aggressive""],    ""wheel"": [""functional"", ""wide""],    ""doors"": [""regular""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""functional"", ""wide""],    ""spoiler"": [""big"", ""functional""],    ""exhaust"": [""three""]  }}```"
TOYOTA Yaris Cross,"The Yaris nameplate is around for quite some time, proof of its success in Europe.  But this time, Toyota decided to enter the B-SUV market, confident that the brand’s fans would be excited. Extremely versatile, the Yaris Cross offered features of an SUV combined with a nice design, a mud’s friend and a family’s trusted companion. Talking about versatility, the Yaris Cross was designed to do well in all different situations. The trunk would open if tapped with the foot, and the cargo area was equipped with holding straps to prevent luggages from falling over. Once the trunk floor was lowered, the space increased considerably. The exterior design was based on the image of a diamond, having sharp and strong lines. As we said, a bit of mud was never an issue for the new Yaris, having a high ground clearance and bold fenders on top of the 18-inch wheels. We already concluded that the car was versatile and suited every need, but Toyota focused on the CO2 emissions as well. The Yaris had the 4th generation of hybrid technology, with emissions lower than 90 g/km CO2 for the 4WD. Both the 3-cylinder 1.5-liter petrol engine and the 59 kW Li-Ion battery provided a total of 116 hp, thus making it an agile car that was great in overtaking. The new Yaris was based on TYNGA (Toyota New Global Architecture) and offered a higher driving position, body rigidity, a low center of gravity and a reduced body roll.

TOYOTA Aqua,"Toyota tried to get more money from the Prius' platform and introduced the first generation of the Aqua compact-segment hatchback in 2012. Despite its modest success, it tried again in 2021 with a second generation. The hybrid vehicles were not successful from the start. Prius tried hard to make a name for itself when it was launched, but in the end, it became a highly successful nameplate. On the other hand, Toyota needed to make more money from that hybrid platform and introduced the Prius C, which became Aqua. For the 2021 model year, the Aqua showed the same compact size as its predecessor but with a styling that made it different than the hybrid-powered sibling Corolla. At a glance, it might not even pass as a hybrid vehicle due to its broad black grille at the front. Its rounded-shaped trim that adorned the front bumper and the small headlights mounted lower in the bumper suggested more of a sporty five-door hatchback than an eco-friendly vehicle. Its sculptured side panels and the roof spoiler enhanced the car's dynamic appearance. Inside, the carmaker installed bucket seats with high bolstering. The dashboard featured a floating-type 10.5"" touch-screen above the center stack. A fully digital instrument cluster showed all the important information needed by the driver. On the center console, Toyota installed a compartment for a smartphone, while the gear-selector was attached on the dashboard's edge. For the rear passengers, the carmaker installed a split-folding bench profiled mostly for two passengers, even though there was a third headrest for an occasional middle passenger.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Aqua"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""dynamic"", ""eco-friendly""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broad"", ""black""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""small"", ""lower-mounted""],    ""bumper"": [""rounded-shaped""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""spoiler"", ""sculptured""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA bZ,"Toyota was known for a few attributes, such as off-road expertise and the hybrid revolution it brought along with the Prius. It even combined these two elements, and the result was a range of premium SUVs with the After doing intensive research, Toyota decided to join the plug-in hybrid evolution with the Lexus NX in 2020. But the Japanese carmaker made a crucial step when it launched the bz4X model. It was a BEV (Battery-Electric Vehicle) developed from the ground up. The bz4X looked like no other Toyota on the road. Its tall front fascia with a curved spoiler at the bottom mimicked the car's off-road abilities. It sported only a narrow grille on the lower side of the apron. Toyota enhanced the look of the wheel fenders with black, unpainted, plastic overfenders. At the back, a duck-tail lip spoiler and a raked-forward windscreen emphasized the crossover's dynamic appearance. At the same time, a set of 20"" light-alloy wheels completed the car's high-rider stance. Its futuristic exterior look was continued by the cockpit, where a TFT display replaced the traditional analog dials. Toyota named the interior design theme as ""lagom,"" which came from Swedish and defines the ""just right"" approach. Basically, it is a minimalist design. The carmaker placed the infotainment system atop the center stack with a touchscreen and wireless connectivity to both Android and iOS smartphones. The bz4X platform, e-TNGA, featured a long wheelbase with wheels placed in the corners. Its four-wheel steering system allowed it to make very tight turns, with a radius of just 5.7 m (18.7 ft). Toyota worked together with Subaru to develop the all-wheel-drive system for the bz4X. Still, it offered it with a front-wheel-drive system as well.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Toyota bz4X"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""premium SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""off-road"", ""dynamic"", ""futuristic"", ""minimalist"", ""premium""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked-forward""],    ""grille"": [""narrow""],    ""hood"": [""tall""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""curved"", ""spoiler""],    ""wheel"": [""20\"" light-alloy"", ""high-rider""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""duck-tail lip""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Harrier,"Toyota introduced in 2017 a mid-life cycle refresh for the 2013 Harrier, a Japan-only re-badged Lexus RX. The Japanese carmaker launched the Harrier's first generation in 1997 and kept it on the market for six years before it unveiled the second generation. Toyota rushed to improved it, and after just five years, it added important technological and safety features. From the design point of view, there were several changes to the car. At the front, it sported a different badge than the rest of its stablemates, with an eagle head instead of the Toyota logo. Its grille was almost completely covered on the upper side, with only a narrow and wide gap underneath, above the bumper. An additional cooling area for the lower-mounted radiators found its place in the bumper. The angular-looking headlights with sharp corners and curved upper and lower sides created an aggressive image for the compact-sized SUV. At the back, the raked-forward tailgate sported a spoiler at the upper side. Inside, the Harrier featured a leather-clad interior. It wasn't at the same quality level as the premium RX model, but it was close. Its instrument cluster featured two dials that flanked a TFT screen between them for the onboard computer. On the center stack, a large infotainment touch-screen display featured the Entune Toyota system. Under the skin, the Harrier offered a choice of gasoline and hybrid drivetrains with either a front or all-wheel-drive system.

TOYOTA Etios Liva,"Toyota introduced the Etios Liva in 2011 as its base model for the Indian market, and it was the hatchback version for the 2010 Etios sedan. As a world leader in the automotive industry, Toyota tried to be present in any significant market in the world. The Etios might not have been an expensive car, but it could sell in high numbers. For that, the Japanese carmaker targeted a few specific markets such as India, Brazil, and Pakistan. While the sedan was an important vehicle for families, the hatchback version was more suitable for the younger generations. The Etios Liva showed the typical Toyota front fascia with a wide V-shaped slatted grille and angular headlights from the front side. An additional air-intake to cool the engine found its way on the lower side of the bumper. Depending on the trim level, the Etios Liva featured fog-lights and light-alloy wheels. Its slightly sculptured door panels and the small roof-spoiler in the back were proof of attention from the automotive giant. Inside, the carmaker installed a curved dashboard where the instrument cluster took center stage. On the center stack, Toyota installed the audio system and two air-vents. The carmaker placed another set of vents on the sides. Toyota offered the Etios Liva with a choice of two engines: a 1.2-liter gasoline and a 1.4-liter turbo-diesel.

TOYOTA Century Sedan,"The Century was Toyota's most luxurious car in its lineup, easily overtaking any Lexus ever made by the same automaker, and was considered a state vehicle built for those seated in the back. Moreover, it didn't even feature a Toyota badge on it. The Japanese car market needed a luxurious vehicle back in the late '60s, and Toyota gladly produced it. It was the first generation of the Century. Fast forward to 2018, and it reached its third generation, which was later constantly upgraded and updated to keep up with the latest technological achievements. It was considered by many the Japanese interpretation of a Rolls-Royce. With a design that took its inspiration from its predecessors, the model launched in 2018 was a mix of old-school design and new technologies. At the front, Toyota installed modern LEDs inside a set of headlights that looked strikingly similar to the ones from the first generation. Moreover, the grille was redesigned but still resembled the old ones due to its egg-crate styling with vertical and horizontal slats. Toyota installed in the middle of it the Century-specific badge, which was the Phoenix bird, and it was handmade and hand-painted by a human artist. Moreover, the automaker used the same process for all Century's badges that were spread in and around the vehicle. From its profile, the sedan was big and similar in size to the Rolls-Royce Ghost. Despite using the same proportions as its predecessors, the third generation of the Century featured door mirrors instead of fender-mounted ones. But what it carried over from those models was the thick C-pillar behind the rear doors. Finally, at the back, the majestic vehicle had recessed LED taillights that emerged from the rear quarter panels to the trunk lid. Toyota said that the interior of the Century was inspired by Japanese culture, and it's easy to understand why. Unlike European, British, or American cars, the Century featured wool upholstery. In fact, not just the four individual seats were covered in that, but also the door cards and the headliner. In addition, the automaker added wood trims on several areas but strangely put carbon fiber around the gear selector that was on the center console. Fronting the driver was a mixed instrument cluster that featured two large analog dials for the speedometer and tachometer and a TFT display between them. On the dashboard, atop the center stack, Toyota added a screen for the infotainment system. Unlike those installed in Lexus or other Toyota models, this one was a touchscreen and wasn't controlled via a trackball or touchpad. But the most important seats in the house were those in the back. There, the owner could recline their seat and move the front passenger seat forward to stretch their legs. To improve their customers' privacy, Toyota installed a set of curtains on the rear windscreen and rear side windows. Unlike the second generation of the Century, which was powered by a V12, the third generation of this luxurious vehicle came fitted with a hybrid drivetrain that featured a V8 under the hood and an electric motor. Unlike that, this one was carefully adjusted and balanced, so it didn't send any vibration to the cabin. Power went to the rear wheels only via an eCVT gearbox.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Century"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""big, similar to Rolls-Royce Ghost"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""majestic"", ""old-school with modern touch"", ""inspired by Japanese culture"", ""carefully balanced""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""egg-crate styling"", ""Century-specific Phoenix badge""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""modern LEDs"", ""similar to first generation""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""thick C-pillar"", ""door mirrors""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Etios,"Toyota made a decisive step into the Indian market when it introduced the Etios in 2010, entering the budget-friendly sedan segment. The Japanese automaker had to build a factory in India to avoid huge import taxes for cars in that country. On the other hand, Toyota didn't want to spend too much on the car's development if it wanted to stay competitive in the budget-friendly segment. Thus, it took the NBC platform from an older Yaris, reworked it, and named it EFC. The Etios sedan featured a bold front fascia fitted with ample headlights flanking a chromed-adorned grille. On the lower bumper, the automaker added a second grille to help cool the engine. Depending on the trim level, the Etios sported a pair of fog lamps. From its profile, the small-sized sedan revealed a clean design enhanced by the turn signals incorporated into the door mirrors. A sportier version of it even received a set of aerodynamic side sills and a lower apron for the rear bumper. Its sedan shape was considered appropriate by middle-class buyers from India. Inside, the automaker used budget-friendly materials. Etios' cloth upholstery covered the seats and part of the door cards, which was better than its competitors could do. Like the Yaris, the Etios featured a center-mounted instrument cluster placed on top of the dashboard. Lower, on the center stack, the automaker installed the buttons for the HVAC unit right under the stereo CD. Underneath the hood, Toyota installed its old 1.2-liter gasoline engine paired with a five-speed manual for the base models. Yet, those who wished for a punchier engine could get a 1.5-liter gasoline or a 1.4-liter turbo-diesel.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Etios"",  ""year"": ""2010"",  ""size"": ""small-sized sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""budget-friendly"", ""clean"", ""appropriate"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""chromed-adorned""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""ample""],    ""bumper"": [""lower"", ""second grille""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""incorporated turn signals""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA VERSO-S,"Based on the same platform as the Yaris, the Verso-S lost the Yaris nameplate and tried to distinguish itself as a separate Toyota model. The second generation of the Verso-S came on the market in 2010. It was a bold move on a market where the SUVs were gaining more and more customers. Since it was based on the Yaris and it tried to keep some similar shapes, the 2010 Veso-S sported similar-shaped headlights as its small-sized hatchback sibling. The Verso-S was taller, like if the designers took a picture of a Yaris and stretched it upwards. Thus, it resulted in a very raked front end that started from the grille and ended on the roof. In the back, the tailgate was vertical, and that led to a roomier interior. Inside, the carmaker installed higher seats, but it didn't try to fit three rows. Two of them were just enough to fit five adult passengers. To enhance the car's interior, Toyota offered an option of a panoramic glass roof, which was an unusual feature for the small segment. The interior designers moved the gear selector on the center stack, both for the manual or automatic transmission. Unlike some versions of the Yaris, they installed the instrument cluster in front of the driver, with a panel divided into three dials. The coolant-temperature gauge was removed and replaced with a warning light. Under the hood, Toyota offered a choice of two engines: 1.33-liter gasoline and a turbo-diesel, both paired to a six-speed manual.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Verso-S"",  ""year"": ""2010"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""bold"", ""tall"", ""roomy"", ""panoramic"", ""functional""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [""front""],    ""hood"": [""similar-shaped""],    ""headlights"": [""similar-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""higher""],    ""roof"": [""panoramic""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Aygo X,"Despite being a serious SUV manufacturer, Toyota didn't have any small-segment crossover on the European market, but that changed in 2021 when it launched the Aygo X. Spelled like Aygo Cross, the new version of the Aygo was an answer for Ford Fiesta Active, Dacia Sandero Stepway, and other cars from the small segment on the European market because that's where it introduced it. Adding more black, unpainted plastics around the wheels and a plastic, silver shield under the front bumper wouldn't be a complete makeover for a car. Yet, the little Aygo showed an SUV-inspired stance. It also featured a slightly higher ground clearance than the non-X version by 11 mm (0.43""). Sure, that didn't transform the small-segment Aygo into a true off-road beast, but it helped their drivers tackle the curbs easier while parking. Just to show more appreciation for this version, Toyota added unique colors for the Aygo-X. The car's interior also offered more features and youth-oriented amenities, such as a 300W sound system with a subwoofer in the trunk. Even though that cut its share from the overall 231 liters (8.15 cu-ft) trunk space, it was more appreciated by young customers. If they needed to do some shopping, they could have folded down the rear seats. Toyota equipped the Aygo-X with all the safety features in the storage, including advanced automatic braking systems and pedestrian and cyclist detection. Moreover, only one engine was available for the powertrain: a 1.0-liter, three-cylinder naturally aspirated unit that provided a mere 71 hp.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Aygo X"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""SUV-inspired stance"", ""youth-oriented"", ""unique colors""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""plastic, silver shield""],    ""wheel"": [""black, unpainted plastics""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Prius Prime,"Toyota made another step towards its electrification program and introduced the plug-in hybrid version of the Prius in 2016, a vehicle that, from the automaker’s point of view, could solve the dilemma between a hybrid and a battery-electric vehicle. When Toyota introduced the Prius on the market in 1997, it surprised the world. Still, the first generation of this nameplate didn’t last too long and was replaced by a second generation in 2003. That model was the one that gave the world the much-needed answer for long-range, low emissions and minimal running costs. Over the years, other automakers caught up and introduced their hybrids or plug-in hybrids, and Toyota was the only major player that didn’t have a PHEV in its lineup. As a result, its engineers burned the midnight oil and delivered a solution. After Toyota launched the fourth generation of the Prius in 2015, it unveiled the Prius Prime at the 2016 New York Auto Show. The Japanese automaker tried to make a clear distinction between its models, the Prius and the Prius Prime. Even if the vehicles shared the same TNGA platform and had a similar shape, some details differentiated them. At the front, for instance, the Prime featured slim LED headlights with four distinct blocks and corner-mounted blinkers. In addition, the automaker added daytime running lights on the bumper, with a tall and slim design. Moreover, the car’s front fascia was also altered and included a redesigned grille, which was mostly blocked to improve aerodynamics. From its profile, the car offered the same look as its hybrid sibling. It featured sculptured door panels and an ascending belt line and ended at the back of the vehicle with a short trunk and a lip spoiler. A particular detail about this vehicle was on the rear quarter panels. While the Prius featured one fuel flap on the left side of the vehicle, the Prime had two, one on each side. One was for the fuel, and the other was to charge the batteries. Inside, the automaker offered customers an 11.6” portrait-mod touchscreen for the infotainment unit. The comfortable front seats were available with either cloth or man-made leather upholstery. Like on the previous generations of the Prius, the Prime version featured an instrument cluster placed in the middle of the dashboard, on top of it, above the infotainment screen. In addition, customers could order the car with a full-color head-up display. In the back, the larger battery pack of the vehicle didn’t affect the passenger area, so they had the same legroom and headroom as in the regular Prius. Under the hood was the same 1.8-liter Atkinson gasoline engine that powered the front wheels via an eCVT transmission. In addition, the car had a larger, 8.8 kWh battery pack that customers could recharge at home in 5h30’ at a regular 110-volt power outlet. Those living in countries with a 220-volt grid could do that in half the time, 2h45,’ respectively.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Prius Prime"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""efficient"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""distinct"", ""aerodynamic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""slanted""],    ""grille"": [""redesigned"", ""blocked""],    ""hood"": [""smooth""],    ""headlights"": [""slim"", ""LED"", ""corner-mounted""],    ""bumper"": [""tall"", ""slim"", ""daytime running lights""],    ""wheel"": [""standard""],    ""doors"": [""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [""standard""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""lip""],    ""exhaust"": [""hidden""]  }}```"
TOYOTA Crown SUV,"Toyota revolutionized the Crown nameplate with the introduction of the 2023 model year in 2022 and brought it back into the U.S. after 50 years. Toyopet was the first Crown sold by Toyota in the U.S. from the late '50s until 1972. Still, it continued to use the nameplate for its most luxurious vehicles in Japan. But fast-forward half of the century, and the Crown nameplate returned as a modern vehicle, with a half-SUV presence and plenty of standard features. Built on top of Toyota's global architecture, the GA-K platform, the Crown impressed with its unusual height for a luxury sedan. Its front fascia featured a wide lower mesh grille flanked by two air intakes to cool the brakes. A lower lip spoiler gave the car a sportier look, even though Toyota didn't offer the Crown as a sports sedan. The slim LED headlights fitted as standard, and the waved beltline created a strong image for the vehicle. At the back, the trunk opened wide, albeit it was not that tall since it didn't open together with the rear windscreen. Toyota offered an elegant yet functional interior with a standard eight-way adjustable driver's seat. Moreover, both front bucket seats came equipped with heating. The dashboard was designed in a minimalist concept, with a clear horizontal line. Above it were the instrument panel and the 12.3"" infotainment touchscreen placed under the same glass, offering the illusion of a seamless horizontal screen. In the back, there was enough room for two passengers on the split-folding (60/40) bench. The carmaker offered the Crown a choice of two hybrid powertrains named HYBRID MAX, with gasoline-powered engines of 2.4 and 2.5-liter, respectively.

TOYOTA Vios,"Built for the Eastern countries, the third generation B-segment Toyota Vios was launched in March 2013, and just by the looks you could tell it’s a more mature car than the previous models. The “Vios” nameplate came for the latin word “vio” which means “to move forward”. Its design was quite interesting, having a V-shaped nose and a large trapezoidal grille, tinted headlights and large blacked out areas that gives it a bolder look. Another important visual and functional change is that the headlights had light projectors instead of classic reflector-backed bulbs. This budget sedan is quite big for its class, measuring 4,410 mm in length and 1,700 mm in width. The interior is redesigned, having sharp sweeping lines and with the instrument cluster mounted back behind the steering wheel. It features a sporty three-binnacle design with red backlight while the displays and buttons on the central console are all lit in blue. Toyota always based its work on the concept of not replacing what isn’t broken, but improving for better, thus their cars were mostly bought for reliability rather than for looks. Of course, the Vios didn’t look bad, it just wasn’t a beautiful car, but buyers counted on it for driving them from A to B without much of a hassle. The gasoline engine with the VVT-I technology included delivered 109 hp and drove the car to maximum of 171 km/h. It took 12 seconds for the Vios to reach 100 kph. The engine was mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Toyota Vios"",  ""year"": ""2013"",  ""size"": ""big for its class"",  ""overall-design"": [""mature"", ""interesting"", ""bolder"", ""reliable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""trapezoidal"", ""large""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""tinted"", ""projectors""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Corolla Cross (US),"Creating a small-sized crossover based on the Corolla's platform was just one step made by Toyota to gain an advantage in this market segment, but adding the hybrid version was the right way to do it. But the Japanese automaker didn't start with that when it launched the Corolla Cross on the American Continent for the 2022 model-year. Still, the carmaker said that it would eventually launch a hybrid version in early 2023 for the 2024 model-year, and that's what it did at the NYIAS in April 2023. Along with the new drivetrain, the vehicle also featured some styling updates. Thus, the front fascia received a broader black grille that covered most of the front lower bumper. In addition, the design of the upper air intake was redesigned and featured a body-colored horizontal slat interrupted by the company's logo. In the back, there were no significant differences. Even though it looked very similar to its European sibling, it wasn't identical. Inside, the U.S. version of the Corolla Hybrid surprised its customers with regular analog dials inside the instrument cluster. The large tachometer and speedometer also housed the gauges for the coolant's temperature and the fuel level, respectively. In addition, atop the center stack, in a free-floating position, the automaker installed the touchscreen for the infotainment system. But the most crucial upgrade was for the drivetrain. Here, the Japanese automaker installed a gasoline engine that moved the front wheels, while an electric motor could kick in when needed, powering the rear axle.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Corolla Cross"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""small-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""small-sized"", ""hybrid"", ""stylish"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""broader"", ""black""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""front lower""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Agya,"Toyota owned the Daihatsu brand, and it developed a small MPV for specific markets and sold it under both badges for both brands. In some markets, Toyota didn't want to offer a budget vehicle that could spoil the big company name, so it let Daihatsu sell it as a sub-brand. The Toyota badge was better known in other markets, and it was selected as a preferred brand to sell the small MPV. Unfortunately, the small vehicle was not available in the European or the North-American markets, selling it in significant volumes. Toyota thought it would be better to keep the Aygo/Yaris for those customers. The Agya's egg shape was interrupted by a few angular lines on the headlights and the aggressive bumper design. On its sides, the ascending line followed a hot-hatch sporty profile, ended with a roof-spoiler mounted on top of the liftgate. Toyota protected the high-mounted taillights for small bumps in the parking lot or by shopping carts in the rear. Inside, it was surprisingly roomy for its size, thanks to the high seating position and the tall greenhouse. Despite being a small, budget vehicle, it offered adequate comfort features and a sound system with a USB port and a CD-player. The instrument cluster was dominated by a huge speedometer that took center stage and a smaller tachometer on its left side. An LCD took the right side and showed info for the on-board computer. Under the hood, Toyota installed a choice of two gasoline engines that offered 68 hp and 88 hp, respectively. The carmaker paired both of them to a 5-speed manual while a 4-speed automatic was on the options list.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Agya"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""egg-shaped"", ""sporty"", ""roomy"", ""budget-friendly""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""tall""],    ""grille"": [""aggressive""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angular""],    ""bumper"": [""aggressive""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof-mounted""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Rukus,"Toyota tried to introduce a cheaper sub-brand under its umbrella, the Scion. Still, soon after, it died killed by the 2008 world economic crisis's after-effects. The Scion xB was not very successful on the market, but since it used the same platform as the Toyota Corolla/Auris, it was easy to build by the Japanese carmaker. In 2007, due to high demands for spacious, but small, hatchbacks on several markets, it introduced the Rukus. Basically, the Rukus was a re-badged Scion xB with a different front bumper, hood, and badge. The high-roof, boxy, appearance was needed to offer enough interior room. In the back, the flat and vertical tailgate was cut around the taillights. Since the car featured a short wheelbase, the designers had to put higher seats for all passengers to provide enough legroom and headroom. The dashboard was flat and narrow, with the instrument cluster placed in the middle. Their design mimicked an inline-four engine, with separate clusters for the dials and the digital speedometer. The car featured an infotainment unit with a sat-nav system that was installed above the center stack, closer to the passenger than to the driver. Toyota installed a 2.4-liter, naturally aspirated engine under the Rukus's hood. It was paired as standard to a 4-speed automatic gearbox that sent the power to the front wheels. It was the only option available.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Scion xB / Toyota Rukus"",  ""year"": ""2007"",  ""size"": ""small, spacious"",  ""overall-design"": [""high-roof"", ""boxy"", ""flat"", ""vertical"", ""narrow""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""different"", ""flat""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""different"", ""front""],    ""wheel"": [""short wheelbase""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""high""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TOYOTA Yaris Hatchback,"Toyota tried to get a share of the U.S. small-segment market and introduced the Yaris hatchback in 2018, but the customers were up for a surprise. It was not unusual for the Japanese carmaker to sell small-segment vehicles on various markets. Still, it was unusual for it to sell re-badged vehicles, such as the Yaris hatchback. Behind that Toyota badge on the grille, the car was a Mazda 2. From the outside, only the headlights might give a clue that under that bodywork was a Mazda 2 vehicle. At the front, the huge grille from the lower side of the bumper reminded us of the ""Jaws"" movie, while the two sculptured lines from its sides might remind you of the Storm Troopers masks. Unlike its sedan sibling, the Yaris hatchback featured a sloped, curved rear end. Its tailgate tall opening was good in creating a low loading area, but it was not that wide. Inside, it was a Mazda 2 from top to bottom, except for a few Toyota upgrades. The carmaker installed a 7"" infotainment touch-screen on top of the center stack for the entire range. An additional rotary knob placed between the front seats could also control the unit. Toyota claimed a 15.9 cu-ft (450 liters) trunk size.

TOYOTA Grand Highlander,"Toyota introduced the 2023 Grand Highlander lineup as a new model in its stable just a few hours before the Chicago Auto Show opening and offered this model with three available grades. The Japanese automaker was already known for its impressive SUV lineup, and it made the Grand Highlander a competitor for minivans and other crossovers as well. Toyota offered the new vehicle with three available powertrains and three available trim levels. Moreover, since it was a three-row vehicle, it also provided room for eight and a large trunk in the back. From the outside, the massive vehicle sported a front fascia with LED daytime running lights and headlamps. At the front, the main grille was placed in the bumper and featured a trapezoidal shape with angled surroundings. On the sides, the three-row SUV featured muscular-looking wheel fenders and sculptured door panels. Finally, at the back, the raked-forward D-pillars and tailgate made the rear overhang look normal, despite being more extended than on the regular Highlander. Inside, up to eight passengers could enjoy all the comfort they need. The Grand Highlander also boasted a 12.3"" Toyota Audio Multimedia unit placed in a floating position atop the center stack. The upper trim levels benefited from a leather-wrapped interior. A seven-seat option with two captain seats in the middle row was also on the options list. As for the loading area, with all the second and third seats folded down, the Grand Highlander provided 98 cu-ft (2,775 liters) of cargo space. The three drivetrains available were either exclusively gas-powered or hybrid versions. While the 2.4-liter turbocharged gasoline engine and the 2.5-liter Hybrid were available in front or all-wheel drive configurations, the 2.5-liter Hybrid Max was exclusively offered with traction on all four wheels.",TOYOTA,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Grand Highlander"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""massive"",  ""overall-design"": [""muscular"", ""sculptured"", ""raked-forward"", ""comfortable"", ""impressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""trapezoidal"", ""angled""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""daytime running""],    ""bumper"": [""front""],    ""wheel"": [""muscular-looking""],    ""doors"": [""sculptured""],    ""roof"": [""raked-forward""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
TVR Griffith,"After ending the production of the 1991 model Griffith in 2002, the British car-maker TVR went into silence for over a decade about their flagship model and, in 2017, it unveiled the next generation. It was unveiled at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. It took the center stage and made the wealthy guests open their check-books. But the car was to be released as a series model in 2020. Due to the pandemic situation and the fact that there was no factory, the car was still gathering orders and nobody could tell when they will be delivered. Back to the car itself. The 2020 Griffith featured a new, bold design with LED headlights and a sculptured front area. The wide grill was placed lower, with two side air-intakes to enhance the aerodynamic. An arched roofline with a short 2-seat cabin with a large shelf for luggage in the back. On the sides, behind the front fenders, the concept-car featured the exhausts on each side. Most probably those will be moved to the back, under the big diffuser, since the safety regulations forbid the side exhausts. Inside, the Griffith featured a TFT display for the instrument cluster and a touch-screen display for the infotainment system. Since TVR designed its vehicles in a different way than other sports-cars manufacturers, it showed an interior with a different layout for buttons and controls. The driver was surrounded by the center console. The entire car was focused on the driver. It was a true driver's car. The engine was a 5.0-liter Cosworth V8 mated to a 6-speed manual. The 50:50 weight distribution contributed to the car's handling along with the independent suspension in all corners. The extensive use of carbon-fiber elements led to a low weight of only 1250 kg (2756 lbs).",TVR,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Griffith"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""bold"", ""sculptured"", ""wide"", ""arched"", ""driver-focused""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sleek""],    ""grille"": [""wide"", ""lower-positioned""],    ""hood"": [""sculptured""],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""arched""],    ""diffusor"": [""big""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""side-mounted""]  }}```"
VAUXHALL Astra Estate,"Along with the introduction of Astra's first station wagon, Vauxhall also unveiled a more powerful version that revived an older nameplate: the GSe. Vauxhall's hot hatches were highly appreciated in the UK, and Stellantis came up with the idea of a hot station wagon based on the same platform as the rest of the Astra range. That was unusual for two reasons: there were few powerful station wagons in that segment, and also it was also Vauxhall's first long-roof version for the Astra. Creating such a vehicle was relatively easy for the automaker. It took the already existing Sports Tourer bodywork and enhanced it with GSe-specific amenities. Thus, at the front, the car featured the same front bumper as the five-door Astra GSe, added a set of 19"" light-alloy wheels, and adorned the back of the car with a redesigned roof spoiler mounted on the upper side of the tailgate. Inside, the carmaker installed a fully digital Pure Panel with two large 10-inch widescreen displays. The dashboard's minimalist design and the center console's clean lines were part of Opel's design philosophy. For this sporty version, the automaker installed high-bolstered bucket seats at the front that promised better side support during high-speed cornering maneuvers. Yet, the practical side wasn't left behind, and despite the bigger battery pack, it could still provide 516 liters (18.2 cu-ft) of space with the rear bench up, or 1,553 liters (54.8 cu-ft) with the backseats folded down. Under the hood, the car received a plug-in hybrid powertrain that offered 225 PS (222 hp) on tap sent to the front wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission.",VAUXHALL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Astra"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""station wagon"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""powerful"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""practical""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""front"", ""GSe-specific""],    ""wheel"": [""19-inch light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""redesigned"", ""spoiler-mounted""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": [],    ""interior"": [""digital Pure Panel"", ""minimalist dashboard"", ""clean center console"", ""high-bolstered bucket seats""],    ""cargo-space"": [""516 liters with rear bench up"", ""1,553 liters with backseats folded down""],    ""powertrain"": [""plug-in hybrid"", ""225 PS"", ""eight-speed automatic transmission""]  }}```"
VAUXHALL Astra Hatchback,"Vauxhall stepped up its game under Stellantis' ownership and introduced a sportier version of its compact hatchback Astra on the British market with the GSe version. After switching sides and moving from GM to Stellantis, Opel and Vauxhall started to share their underpinnings with the French automakers Peugeot and Citroen. Thus, the Astra received the same platform as the Peugeot 308, which was used on many other cars as well. In addition, the GSe version was introduced as a hot-hatch version for the Astra and benefited from a plug-in hybrid and several other changes when compared to the rest of the Astra range. On the visual side, the front bumper was modified so it could fit a broad, U-shaped grille, incorporating the fog lamps on the sides. Likewise, the main grille was slightly pinned-down, sporting a wide V-shaped lower line. From its side, the Astra revealed the same floating-roof design and sculptured doors as the rest of the range. Finally, at the back, the automaker didn't conceal the exhaust system under the rear bumper and left it exposed. Inside, the carmaker installed a digital cockpit with a fully-glazed option. The dashboard's minimalist design and the center console's clean lines were part of the trend. Like its European sibling, the 2023 Astra GSe featured a pair of ergonomic seats that offered a comfortable ride and good support for the occupants. In the back, a split-folding bench provided room for three adults.

VAUXHALL Corsa 5 Doors,"-This is the sixth generation of the Corsa and the model's roots go way back to 1982. Now, the German brother of the PSA group has launched a new generation of its small car, but some might say that it is very close technically to the new Peugeot 208. The new generation of the Vauxhall Corsa is the same vehicle as its german sibling with Opel emblems The styling, of course, is genuine Opel and, for the first time, it is available with LED headlights on the whole range, regardless the engine type. For the bodywork, the manufacturer decided to put the car on a drastic diet, reducing its base model weight bellow 1000 kg (2204 lbs), which is impressive if we take into account that the vehicle is equipped with all the mandatory modern safety features. For the engine department, Opel offers a small range of variants, gasoline and electric. The base model has a 1.2-liter three-cylinder gasoline engine with 75 HP, while the top version is a pumped-up turbocharged version of its base model, but offers 130 HP. They worked hard to keep the fuel consumption low. According to the newest WLTP form, the new Corsa can use between 3.6 and 6.1 liter/100 km (65.3 mpg – 38.5 mpg) depending on the engine. For those who are willing to pack a full list of options on a city car, the Corsa can be equipped with an 8-speed AT transmission.

VAUXHALL Corsa 3 Doors,"Vauxhall introduced the fourth generation of the Corsa in 2014 at the Paris Motor Show and its European sibling, the fifth generation of the Opel Corsa. When Opel introduced the Corsa's first generation in Europe, Vauxhall chose a different badge and named the 1982 small-segment vehicle the Nova. It switched to the Corsa designation only from the second generation in 1993. Fast forward to 2014, and the British carmaker introduced the last Corsa designed and engineered by General Motors since the American carmaker sold both brands to Peugeot-Citroen in 2019. The front fascia featured the ""wing"" shaped headlights, which incorporated Vauxhall's signature and LED daytime running lights. Its reversed trapezoidal grille featured the chromed Vauxhall badge, and a lip-spoiler adorned the lower part of the apron. An arched rear side window amplified the sporty look of the three-door version, while the sculptured doors and rear fenders made the car look longer. Inside, the Corsa featured five seats but with limited access for the rear passengers. The dashboard was simple and plain on the base models, with a center stack where the carmaker installed the radio and climate controls. On higher trim levels, Vauxhall installed a new infotainment unit with a 7"" touch-screen. In addition, it featured connectivity with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Vauxhall offered the Corsa a choice of five gasoline and two turbo-diesel engines paired as standard with a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic, depending on the version.

VAUXHALL VXR8,"Most of the Vauxhall cars are just re-badged and right-hand drive European Opel vehicles. But not all of them. The Vauxhall VXR8 was a big difference. And it was based on an Australian car. Far away from the U.S. and Europe, Australia has its national brand, named Holden. It is part of General Motors and it has some freedom to make cars suited for Australians. One of those cars was the Holden Monaro. A car that was so good that the Americans took-it and re-badged it as a Pontiac GTO. It was offered as a four-door sedan as well. And that was imported in the U.K. and re-badged as a Vauxhall VXR8. The last year when the car was imported in the U.K. was in 2017. Only 15 units were made and all of them were sold before they were produced. It was a rare car. In the front, it featured a black grille and a big air-intake in the lower part of the bumper. Two side-vents on the front fenders took care of the air trapped in the wheel-well. In the back, a body-colored wing helped to add more downforce to the car. Inside, the front sport-bucket seats were upholstered in leather and featured very big side bolsters. The dashboard resembled the one found in the Opel Insignia, along with the steering wheel and few details. But the most important part of the car was under its skin. The engine was the same LSA V8 from the Chevrolet Camaro. It offered 595 hp and 740 Nm (545 lb-ft) of torque. It was mated with a 6-speed automatic and a 6-speed manual was available as an option.

VAUXHALL Insignia VXR Sedan,"The British twin brother of the Opel Insignia OPC was the Vauxhall Insignia VXR. While the OPC stands for Opel Performance Center, the VXR came from VX Racing (or Vauxhall Racing). The three letters meant more performance for, otherwise, normal daily drivers. Most of the Vauxhall products had a VXR version, for those who didn't want just a regular car. And it wasn't only about the performance. A part of the modifications was made to the car's appearance. The Insignia VXR featured a bigger front bumper with a lower apron and big air-intakes in the middle and on the sides, with satin-silver color for the grille and side scoops. A set of big, 19” light-alloy wheels was installed. The ground clearance was reduced with 10 mm (0.4”) than the standard version. In the back, the redesigned bumper revealed two large exhausts on the sides. When compared with the standard Insignia, the VXR featured sport-bucket seats and standard leather upholstery. On top of the center stack, the manufacturer installed a standard color monitor for the infotainment system, which included the navigation as well. The powertrain offered a twin-turbo V6 engine mated to a standard six-speed gearbox. The all-wheel-drive system featured a Haldex center and an electronic limited-slip rear differential.

VAUXHALL Grandland,"Vauxhall revealed the most powerful version of the Grandland lineup in late 2022 and provided customers with a 300 PS (296 hp), all-wheel-drive crossover. Adding a performance version for a crossover might be a good idea for a premium automaker, but creating such a vehicle for a Vauxhall was unusual. Still, the British automaker that was now under Stellantis' umbrella was allowed to do that so it could provide a flagship model that improved the brand's image. Suddenly, Vauxhall wasn't seen as a mundane vehicle on British roads. Even though it shared most of its body panels with the regular 2022 Grandland, the GSe version came with an improved front fascia that sported piano-black trims on the lower bumper's side scoops. In addition, the automaker offered an improved design for the lower grille, which featured a hexagonal-pattern mesh design instead of horizontal slats. At the back, Vauxhall installed a new roof spoiler. To further enhance the car's sporty look, Vauxhall installed a set of 19"" light-alloy wheels. Inside, there was a new dashboard design with two displays. The touch-screen mounted atop the center stack was for the infotainment system, while the up to 10"" LCD in front of the driver served as an instrument panel. Like its predecessor, the seats were certified by the ""Aktion Gesunder Rücken e.V."" (campaign for healthy backs) for their ergonomic shape. On the center console, the automaker placed the gear selector for the automatic transmission that resembled the one fitted in the Peugeot 3008. Under the hood, the automaker installed a turbocharged 1.6-liter powerplant that provided 200 PS (198 hp), helped by a 110 PS (109 hp) electric motor that drove the rear wheels.",VAUXHALL,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Grandland"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""powerful"", ""all-wheel-drive"", ""premium"", ""improved"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""improved"", ""hexagonal-pattern""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""piano-black trims"", ""lower""],    ""wheel"": [""19-inch"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""new"", ""spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VinFast VF 8,"The Vietnamese automaker broke covers of the magazines with the VF8 in spring 2022, and it looked like a mature vehicle, not a tryout made by a startup company. Vinfast invested many billions in developing a new platform and creating a range of vehicles from the ground up. After the carmaker started to understand what's about the motoring industry, it created a range of electric vehicles ditching the former gasoline-powered vehicle it had already produced since 2019. The VF8 was a crossover that tried to outpace not only its competitors but also brought many improvements and a premium feeling for its customers. At the front, the vehicle sported the signature LED light strip and the V-shape badge that took center stage of the front fascia. On the lower side of the apron, the automaker installed a wide, trapezoidal grille flanked on the sides by the LED daytime running lights and a pair of scoops that channeled the air around the vehicle. The VF8's profile revealed the sculptured door panels and, at the back, a raked-forward rear windscreen for the broad tailgate. Moreover, the back of the car also featured the same signature V-shaped taillights fitted with LEDs. Inside, the carmaker carried over the same idea that Tesla had with a center-mounted, 15.6"" landscape-oriented touch-screen. The driver, on the other hand, could see all the information in front of them, projected on the windshield as a HUD. Thanks to the flat floor, the VF8 provided plenty of room for all five passengers that could fit inside the ample, generous cabin. As an option, the VF8 also came with a sunroof that could've been voice-controlled. The front and the rear outboard seats from the bench were heated and cooled, adding more comfort for customers. Under the hood, the VF8 featured a pair of electric motors that drove all four wheels.

VinFast VF 9,"VinFast didn't let the big family haulers aside and created the VF 9 as a people carrier with room for up to seven people aboard. While the world was shocked due to the war between Russia and Ukraine in Europe, the Vietnamese automaker pushed forward its development program and introduced the VF 9 crossover at the 2022 New York Auto Show. It was a bold move from the carmaker, which tried to stay one step ahead of the competition. With a design signed by the renowned Pininfarina Design Studio, the VF 9 played in the same dimensional league as the well-established crossovers, such as the Chevrolet Traverse or the KIA Telluride. The design, on the other hand, was clearly fresh. The front of the vehicle sported the same signature lighting LED, with a V-shape in the middle, to emphasize the brand's logo. Even though it didn't need too many cooling areas since it was electric, it sported wide air intakes in the apron and above the bumper. From its profile, the car featured a tall beltline ending on unique-looking C-pillars that resembled two V-shapes pointing one to another. The back of the vehicle showed a wide tailgate and a light strip that served as taillights. The interior shared some components with its smaller sibling, the VF8, such as the 15.6"" touch-screen display on the center stack and the HUD for the driver. Thanks to the three rows of seats, the crossover could accommodate up to seven passengers. As an option, the middle row was available with two captain seats that provided more comfort and a premium experience to their occupants.

VOLKSWAGEN ID.3,"Volkswagen brought a refreshed version of the ID.3 small-sized vehicle in 2023, more than three years after model's debut. During these years, the world struggled with a pandemic and a big war on the European continent, but the German automaker had to move on. Its engineers worked hard to produce this facelifted version and to make the small-sized ID.3 more competitive on the market. Thus, apart from some aesthetic changes, it also featured a revised interior and a choice of two batteries. The refreshed ID.3 sported a new front fascia with an enhanced lower bumper that enhanced the car's aerodynamics. Thus, on the sides, it featured two slats that diverted the air from the front of the vehicle to the sides, lowering drag resistance. Another significant upgrade was for the headlights, which were available with Matrix-LED technology and a standard main beam for the entire range. Inside, Volkswagen created a cabin where 77% of the materials were recycled, thus lowering the car's carbon footprint. There was also an augmented reality (AR) head-up display that helped the driver navigate the road and showed important information. Another significant step forward was the introduction of the V2X technology that gathered data from other Volkswagen vehicles or infrastructure to warn the driver about potential hazards on the road. The MEB platform used by the ID.3 featured the same 204 PS (201 hp) motor that drove the rear wheels from its predecessor. It was fed by either a 58 or a 77 kWh battery pack, which allowed the vehicle to travel 426 km (265 miles) or 546 km (340 miles), respectively.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""ID.3"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""small-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""competitive"", ""aerodynamic"", ""sustainable"", ""technological""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""enhanced""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""Matrix-LED"", ""standard main beam""],    ""bumper"": [""enhanced lower bumper""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Tiguan (US),"Since it was the best-selling Volkswagen from its time, the Tiguan received another update for the 2022 model year. Even though it wasn’t a completely new model, it still sported some differences to make it appealing for a few years more. But, just like its predecessor, the second generation of the Tiguan received the facelifted version after five years since its introduction. For the exterior, the 2022 Tiguan designers took their inspiration from the Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport range, with LED daytime running lights that guarded the headlights’ bottom and outer sides. The grille’s crisp lines received a new chromed treatment to make them look bolder than before. Depending on the trim level, the roof-rails were black on S and SE R-Line Black, while the SE, SEL, and R-Line were black. The heated front seats were fitted as standard, and ventilation was available for the upper trim levels. Another welcomed improvement was for the FWD version, which received a standard three-row seating, with a 60/40 split-folding system for the second row and a 50/50 for the third one. Volkswagen installed standard MIB touch-screen infotainment systems on the entire Tiguan range, with a 6.5” display for the Tiguan S and an 8” unit for the others. Also, the Virtual Cockpit Display was the only option available, with an 8” display and an option for a 10.25” cluster available as an option for specific versions.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Tiguan"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""bold"", ""crisp"", ""sporty"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""angled"", ""curved""],    ""grille"": [""chromed"", ""bold"", ""crisp""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""daytime running"", ""guarded""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""black"", ""sleek"", ""stylish""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Touareg R,"The 2024 Volkswagen Touareg R represents the enhanced version of the SUV's facelift model, launched in the same year. However, it is not the first of its kind. In the division's over two decades of existence, it offered some impressive Touaregs, such as the R50 that came equipped with a V10 diesel engine. Although the model made a name for itself through the high torque of the big diesel engine it had in the past, the 2024 version continues the tradition of the pre-facelift model and comes only with a hybrid powertrain. The plug-in hybrid propulsion system in the Touareg R eHybrid consists of a combination of a V6 petrol engine and an electric drive motor. This advanced hybrid drive configuration of the SUV generates an impressive system power of over 450 horsepower, enabling the car to convey it to the wheels through a four-wheel permanent drive system. Combining this with the improved coordination of the running gear and control systems makes the vehicle a real competitor in the fast-SUVs category, of course, keeping in mind the price range. Besides the numerous advanced technologies that the Touareg R inherited from the base version, the flagship has a lot of design features that are meant to differentiate it from the rest of the pack. The specific blue R color is used in many zones, such as the brake calipers and the interior stitching. When starting the car, the R logo pops up on the navigation system to remind the driver once again that he is behind the wheel of a racing-inspired machine, not only a comfortable and very spacious SUV. One awesome feature is the standard 20-inch Braga alloy wheels that can optionally be upgraded to some 22-inch Estoril alloy wheels meant to be more imposing than the car itself. For a better look, the designers of the SUV implemented an R logo projection from the exterior mirror housing, which is turned on whenever the doors are opened, to try somehow to materialize the racing aura that floats around this Volkswagen. The IQ.Light HD matrix headlights and the IQ.Light LED tail light clusters with dynamic brake and turn signal function and illuminated Volkswagen logo have the ability to highlight the fine lines and edges of the car, not only to increase the safety and the comfort of the passengers. To conclude, the Tiguan R eHybrid is such a versatile car that you can take it to the racetrack one day, then the following day, pack all the things you need in the car and go on a road trip with your whole family. Besides this, the off-road trails no longer seem so scary when you're in the front seat of a complete German-made SUV.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Volkswagen Touareg R"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""spacious"",  ""overall-design"": [""racing-inspired"", ""imposing"", ""versatile"", ""German-made""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""IQ.Light HD matrix"", ""fine-lined"", ""dynamic""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""20-inch Braga alloy"", ""22-inch Estoril alloy""],    ""doors"": [""spacious"", ""R-logo projection""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Atlas,"Volkswagen unveiled the 2024 model year Atlas at the beginning of 2023 and improved the big crossover that was based on the same MQB platform as its smaller sibling, the Golf. Using a common base for more vehicles allowed Volkswagen to produce them at lower costs. The increased ground clearance and the available all-wheel drive system allowed the Atlas to perform well in a market that craved SUVs and crossovers. And, after five years on the market, the big VW got its well-deserved facelift. At the front, the Atlas featured a new adaptive front-lighting system (AFS), which surrounded the headlights with a DRL strip. In addition, an illuminated lightbar connected the headlamps. On the main grille, the illuminated round VW logo took center stage, thus creating a premium look for the big crossover. But the automaker didn't stop there and also added a redesigned bumper that sported a set of triangular side scoops pointed inwards. From its profile, the Atlas revealed a muscular stance thanks to the enlarged wheel arches. Finally, at the back, the tilted forward tailgate sported a roof spoiler on its upper side. Inside, the German automaker created a new cabin with an upgraded dashboard. Atop the center stack, Volkswagen installed a 12"" touchscreen for the infotainment system. At the same time, all versions were fitted with a 12.5"" digital instrument panel fronting the driver. Like its predecessor, the 2024 model-year came with three rows of seats and room for seven adults. Underneath the hood, the engine cover left the impression that there was a transversely-mounted V8. But that was only an illusion since the car was powered by a turbocharged inline-four that produced 269 hp (273 PS), which was more potent than the previous VR6 was capable. Power went to the front or in all corners of the car via an eight-speed automatic transmission.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Atlas"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""big"",  ""overall-design"": [""muscular"", ""premium"", ""upgraded"", ""spacious"", ""powerful""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""illuminated"", ""round"", ""premium""],    ""hood"": [""redesigned""],    ""headlights"": [""adaptive"", ""surrounded"", ""DRL"", ""illuminated""],    ""bumper"": [""redesigned"", ""triangular"", ""sporty""],    ""wheel"": [""enlarged"", ""arches""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""tilted"", ""spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Touareg,"The Touareg, Volkswagen's first SUV, was introduced in 2002, marking the brand's entry into an already exploding segment. It set the stage for the success of Volkswagen's SUV lineup, which now spans across various segments. The design DNA of the Touareg, characterized by a distinct front end, raised V-shaped bonnet, and unified headlights, can be seen in all Volkswagen SUVs. The vehicle gained attention for its powerful engines, including the V10 TDI and the limited-edition W12 models, capable of doing unbelievable stunts, like towing a Boeing 747. Carrying the legacy of the first three generations, the 2024 model accommodates new technologies and characteristic features that make the SUV stand out. For instance, besides technologies like Park Assist Plus, Trailer Assist, and Night Vision, one advanced technology seamlessly combines the roof load sensor with the running gear electronics. This integration enhances agility by detecting the presence of a roof box and relaying this information to systems like Electronic Stability Control. Consequently, the vehicle's stability is improved as these systems intervene earlier. On the other hand, without a roof load, Touareg's systems enable a sportier driving experience. With four versions, Basic, Elegance, R-Line, and R Model, the SUV offers a wide variety of types of equipment capable of suiting every buyer's needs. The V6 engine is omnipresent, but in different instances, it can vary from gasoline to diesel or hybrid. Even though the powertrain as a whole is not the same for all the variants, they all share an eight-speed automatic transmission and the 4MOTION permanent all-wheel drive system. Besides the basic version, all the Touaregs will be equipped standard with the new IQ.Light HD matrix headlights, a new technology on all Volkswagen vehicles that will feature almost 40 000 micro LEDs capable of providing an interactive light carpet for a safer driving experience. The Touareg offers versatile on-road and off-road capabilities through its driving profile selection feature. The driver can choose from various profiles and adjust parameters for the automatic gearbox, steering, optional air suspension, engine responsiveness, and assist systems. Depending on the version, the vehicle also offers advanced running gear systems like active roll compensation and all-wheel steering. Adding this to the already existing wide and tall vehicle stance makes adventures much more accessible. The interior of the SUV has received an upgrade to provide an enhanced experience. It now comes standard with the Innovision Cockpit, which combines the Digital Cockpit with a 30.5 cm display and a high-end infotainment system called Discover Pro Max featuring a 38.1 cm touchscreen. The two displays create a seamless digital landscape on a single axis, offering features such as lane-level navigation and high-resolution HD map data. Additionally, the voice control system of the Touareg has gone through significant upgrades. Volkswagen also increased comfort during long road trips through foamed surfaces around the knee area and a 730-watt Dynaudio sound system to keep the passengers entertained.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Touareg"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""wide and tall"",  ""overall-design"": [""distinct front end"", ""raised V-shaped bonnet"", ""unified headlights"", ""versatile on-road and off-road capabilities""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""raised"", ""V-shaped""],    ""headlights"": [""IQ.Light HD matrix"", ""interactive light carpet""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""roof load sensor integration"", ""agility-enhancing""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Passat Variant,"Volkswagen introduced the ninth generation of the Passat in station wagon shape in 2023, continuing the legacy of one of this automaker's best-selling nameplates. In half-of-century, the mid-size contender of the German automaker from Wolfsburg sold more than 34 million units, and it was available over time in several shapes, including a fastback coupe. The station wagon, also known as Variant in Volkswagen's terminology, was deemed one of the most effective vehicles in its class thanks to its fuel efficiency, interior volume, and wide range of options. For the ninth generation, the automaker continued to follow its policy of form-follow-function and improved the vehicle while keeping customers in mind. As a result, the exterior sizes increased compared to its predecessor, and the wheelbase grew as well. The front of the vehicle has shown a distinct departure from the eight-generation of the Passat, with the center of the hood lower than its sides. In addition, the front fascia showed a styling inspired by Volkswagen's electric vehicles, such as the ID.3 and ID.4. The narrow LED headlights were visually connected by a chromed stirp that ran across the upper grille, interrupted only by the carmaker's badge in the middle. The lower bumper featured a broad grille flanked by slim and tall air intakes made to reduce drag, which reached a Cd of 0.25 instead of 0.31 like its predecessor. From its profile, the car looked sporty thanks to its ascending beltline, and the slightly sloped-down roof line ended with a raked-forward tailgate. At the back, the automaker installed wide taillights connected by an LED strip that crossed the tailgate, while the lower bumper completely concealed the tailpipe. It looked mostly like an EV, not a vehicle fitted with an internal combustion engine. Inside, thanks to the longer wheelbase, Volkswagen installed a comfortable interior fit for five adults. The dashboard's design followed the minimalist trend of the automaker already seen on the ID.3, ID.4, and ID.Buzz. In front of the driver, the automaker installed a 10.25"" digital dashboard, while atop the center stack, it placed the 12.9"" infotainment touchscreen. Volkswagen made the front bucket seats available in a few variations, including a set of high-bolstered ones, depending on the engine version, trims, and options. In the back, the Passat Variant offered a split-folding bench seat for three adults. Under the hood, Volkswagen installed a wide choice of seven gasoline or turbodiesel engines, of which two were plug-in hybrid versions. The entire range benefited from automatic (dual-clutch) gearboxes. Power went to the front or in all corners, depending on the engine version. The PHEV variants came with a large battery pack that allowed them to run up to 100 km (62 miles) on electricity alone.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Passat"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""efficient"", ""sporty"", ""minimalist"", ""electric-inspired"", ""wide range of options""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""n/a""],    ""grille"": [""narrow"", ""chromed"", ""upper grille""],    ""hood"": [""distinct"", ""lower center""],    ""headlights"": [""narrow LED"", ""visually connected""],    ""bumper"": [""broad grille"", ""slim and tall air intakes"", ""reduced drag""],    ""wheel"": [""larger""],    ""doors"": [""n/a""],    ""roof"": [""sloped-down"", ""raked-forward""],    ""diffusor"": [""n/a""],    ""spoiler"": [""n/a""],    ""exhaust"": [""concealed""]  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Multivan,"Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles introduced a new generation of the Multivan model in 2021, replacing the aging T 6.1 Caravelle lineup. Even though it came after the facelifted version of the T6, the new generation was not named T7 on the official papers. In addition, unlike its predecessors that were built on designated utility-vehicle platforms, the 2021 Multivan was based on the MQB platform shared with many other cars produced by Volkswagen. Since the vehicle was built as a successor to the Caravelle, it had to be comfortable and good-looking but still bear a van-like appearance. At the front, the narrow, high-mounted headlights resembled those fitted on the Golf, while the fat bumper sported a massive grille with a rhomboidal pattern. From its profile, the MPV featured wide windows that covered the upper third-part of the vehicle. Apart from the big front doors, the Multivan also received one or two sliding doors, depending on the options. Last but not least, the rear tailgate could've been electrically opened. Inside, the Multivan could accommodate up to seven passengers on three rows of individual seats. The last row, which was previously fitted with a bench, consisted of individual places that could've been moved or removed, depending on the necessities. The middle row featured two captain seats that could rotate 180 degrees. At the front, a pair of high-mounted seats were already usual for the Multivan. These allowed their occupants to enjoy the great view offered by the wide windscreen and tall side windows. In addition, the dashboard was mounted low enough not to obstruct their sight. Underneath the car's skin, Volkswagen installed a choice of hybrid and turbodiesel engines. In addition, a plug-in hybrid fitted with a 13kW battery pack was available.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Multivan"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""MPV"",  ""overall-design"": [""comfortable"", ""good-looking"", ""van-like""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""wide"", ""tall""],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""rhomboidal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""narrow"", ""high-mounted""],    ""bumper"": [""fat""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""big front doors"", ""sliding doors""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Golf R Variant,"While the Golf R was designed for those who enjoyed driving and didn't need a large trunk in the back, the Golf R Variant came as an important addition for those who needed a station wagon. A family with kids needs a car with a big trunk where the bicycles, scooters, and other toddler-related items need to be stored. On the other hand, nobody said station wagons can't have powerful engines. And Volkswagen decided to give an important boost to its already known Golf Variant in the form of the R version. The 2021 Golf R Variant shared most of its bodywork with the Golf R up to the B-pillar, but it featured different C-pillars and rear doors. An additional glass area covered the space between the C- and the D-pillar. The carmaker sacrificed some part of the trunk space for this Golf generation and raked-forward the tailgate for a sportier look. Volkswagen even installed a roof spoiler on the upper side of the rear windscreen. Under the bumper, the carmaker installed four oval exhausts, similar to those from the Golf R hatchback. Lile its Golf R sibling, the R Variant featured a sporty interior with high-bolstered front seats. Its full-digital instrument cluster and the paddle-shifters behind the wheel were just a confirmation that it wasn't just a regular grocery-getter. But, since it was a station wagon, it offered a split-folding rear bench which provided between 611 liters (21.6 cu-ft) and 1,642 liters (58 cu-ft) of trunk space. For the drivetrain, Volkswagen installed a turbocharged inline-four gasoline engine. It was paired to either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed DSG (dual-clutch) automatic transmission. Power went to all corners via a newly developed all-wheel-drive system with torque vectoring.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Golf R Variant"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""station wagon"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""powerful"", ""functional"", ""sleek"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked-forward""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""sporty""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""different rear doors""],    ""roof"": [""roof spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""oval exhausts""]  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Polo 5 Doors,"Volkswagen upgraded the sixth generation of its small-segment Polo in 2021 and improved mostly the car's interior, but didn't forget the exterior look or the drivetrain. With 20 million units sold, the Volkswagen Polo was a huge success for the German brand, and the 2021 model came with up-scale features. Even though it was not that small-segment budget car as it was when the first generation went on the market, its core customers asked for more technological improvements. It even came with partly automated driving. With its standard LED headlights, the facelifted sixth generation of the Polo offered a new front fascia. An LED strip for the daytime running lights crossed the car's front from side to side and enhanced the car's look. The carmaker also installed a new bumper with a more aggressive styling on the lower grille. Its taillights were full-LED. As an option, the carmaker offered Matix headlights. Inside, the Polo featured a standard 8"" instrument panel with an option for a 10"" screen behind the steering wheel. For the infotainment system, Volkswagen installed a standard 6.5"" touch-screen on the center stack, with an option for up to 8"". There were four trim levels named Polo, Life, Style, and R-Line. Even the base-level offered a lane keep assist, while the Adaptive Cruise Control was also available. For the drivetrain, Volkswagen announced only gasoline engines. A 1.0-liter engine was available in three power versions: 80 cp, 95 cp, and 110 cp. A 1.0-liter LPG version was announced for fleets, with 90 hp.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Polo"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""up-scale"", ""aggressive"", ""modern"", ""stylish"", ""technological""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""new"", ""aggressive""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""Matix"", ""enhanced""],    ""bumper"": [""new"", ""aggressive""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Golf R,"The Golf R reached its fifth generation and all offered sports car performances, with all-wheel-drive traction and aggressive look. Volkswagen was considered the inventor of the hot-hatch category when it introduced the first generation of the Golf GTI. It was a segment that grew and, soon, other carmakers produced various performance vehicles in the segment. The Golf evolved and offered more and more performances, but they were no longer the kings of the hot-hatches despite their efforts. Honda, Ford, Renault, and Opel/Vauxhall, made a fierce competition. But the Golf R returned to fix that. A hot-hatch doesn't have to look just as regular as the rest of the range. While on older models, there were just a few aesthetic differences, the Golf R went all the way. The taller bumper with huge grilles on the lower side and big side-pods made a perfect match for a car that had to look fierce. The new, slim headlights with an upper LED daytime running light strip made the vehicle looks mean. On the sides, there was a new aerodynamic package with side sills and a bigger rear roof-spoiler. In the back, the four exhausts were shown under the bumper, next to the splitter. Such an aggressive look couldn't be complete without a race-inspired interior. The sport-bucket seats with integrated headrests for the front passengers were high-bolstered to keep their occupants in place while hard-cornering. The full-digital instrument cluster and the paddle-shifters behind the steering wheel made the car looks business. For the drivetrain, Volkswagen installed a turbocharged inline-four gasoline engine.

VOLKSWAGEN Jetta / Vento / Bora,"For three decades, the Jetta was the best-selling Volkswagen on the market, thanks to its compact size and three-box sedan look, which made it suitable for families and company cars as well. In 2021, the German carmaker introduced a facelifted version for Jetta’s seventh generation, which modified the styling and some of the engines. On the outside, the car featured a new grille with two distinctive chromed bars that flanked the VW logo in the middle. For the GLI version, a red strip ran across the bumper, connecting the standard LED headlights. From its sides, the chromed trims around the windows were another standard feature for the 2022 model year. Inside, the German carmaker upgraded the infotainment system to the MIB3 version, fitted as standard for the GLI and available as an option for the rest of the range. Volkswagen also included an 8” display for the instrument cluster, with an option for a 10” unit dubbed Digital Cockpit Pro. As expected, the car featured wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. Under the hood, Volkswagen adopted the 1.5-liter turbocharged unit for most of the range. On the other hand, the GLI, provided the same 2.0-liter turbocharged powerplant as its predecessor.

VOLKSWAGEN T-Roc,"Like a clockwork mechanism, Volkswagen introduced the revised version of the T-Roc four years after its initial launch in 2017. With its mathematical precision, the German carmaker upgraded the Golf-based T-Roc in the autumn of 2021 and brought new features and amenities for the subcompact crossover. While some upgrades were subtle, others were more in your face. The car's exterior design went through a mild refresh that brought more lighting effects and a restyled front area. Also, there were new color options and an R-Line package that added a dynamic appearance to the car. At the front, a daytime running light strip crossed from inside the headlights onto the honeycomb-styled grille. In addition, another set of vertical LED lights adorned the side scoops from the lower side of the bumper. The main headlights were available with an option for MATRIX-LED.  The redesigned LED taillights with cascading turn-signals at the back, while the lower bumper sported fake exhaust tips. Inside, the carmaker enhanced the dashboard's look. As standard, depending on the market, the driver got an 8"" instrument cluster with an option for a 10.25"" unit named Digital Cockpit Pro. In addition, Volkswagen placed a standard 8"" or 9.2"" touch-screen for the infotainment system atop the center stack, depending on the trim level and options. Another improvement was for the door cards, which received standard fabric materials. Under the hood, the carmaker offered a choice of diesel and gasoline engines ranging between 110 PS (108 hp) and 190 PS (187 hp) paired with either manual or seven-speed (dual-clutch) automatic transmissions. In base models, the T-Roc only sent the power to the front wheels, while the all-wheel drive systems were available on the more powerful versions.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""T-Roc"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""subcompact"",  ""overall-design"": [""mathematical precision"", ""mild refresh"", ""dynamic appearance""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""honeycomb-styled""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""daytime running"", ""LED"", ""MATRIX-LED""],    ""bumper"": [""lower side scoops"", ""fake exhaust tips""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""standard fabric materials""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Polo GTI,"In 1975, Volkswagen introduced the inaugural Polo model, followed by the Scirocco GTI in the subsequent year. Despite the long-standing presence of these two names for nearly fifty years, it wasn't until 1998 that the GTI version made its way to the third generation of Polo. Since then, this vehicle has gained recognition in the compact category for its practicality, efficiency, and racing aspirations. Leveraging the reliability of the base model and incorporating speed-focused characteristics, the new Polo GTI stands out as an enjoyable and affordable option for daily driving. With its upgraded technology, drivers can enjoy a comprehensive driving experience that combines classic manual control with a semi-automated mode. The IQ.DRIVE Travel Assist system enables the car to take control of steering, braking, and acceleration between 0 and 130 mph (209 kph). It cleverly integrates two simpler systems, adaptive cruise control and lane assist. However, it is essential to note that the driver must always keep their hands on the steering wheel all the time, hence the semi-automated nature. Staying true to the Polo's tradition, the engine delivers efficiency with moderate fuel consumption, complemented by a DSG transmission. A sport chassis, lowered by two-thirds of an inch, contributes to the car's dynamic stance. The lightweight construction enhances the great alignment of its components and makes the driver who sits behind the sport leather wheel feel like the car can conquer any racetrack. While the compact body of the car affects its luggage capacity, providing a relatively modest 351 liters of capacity, there are some other advantages. For instance, the reduced dimensions make the optional 18-inch alloy wheels appear larger and more stylish, lending the Polo a sportier appearance that may offer a morale and performance boost. The car's rear also has implemented new LED lights featuring animated brake lights and integrated dynamic indicators that make the Polo stand out more even when casually strolling through the city. The chrome exhaust pipe not only transfers the roar of the engine in a very mannered way but also makes a good contrast with the GTI marking from the back of the car. Efficiency is the keyword when talking about the German heritage of the car, as the instruments and infotainment system are strategically positioned within the driver's field of vision for easy readability and usability in all kinds of situations. Despite keeping up with advanced technology, such as including a six-speaker Beats sound system to complement the 10.25 inches display, the main attraction of the interior remains the distinctive GTI touch. The trademark red contrast stitching, Titanium Black trim color for the roof pillars, and roof liner accentuate this compact Volkswagen's performance-oriented character. Combining red, black, and chrome design elements enhances the interior's very sleek appearance.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Polo GTI"",  ""year"": ""1998"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""practical"", ""efficient"", ""racing-inspired"", ""dynamic"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""stylish"", ""sporty""],    ""hood"": [""dynamic""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""animated"", ""dynamic""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""18-inch alloy"", ""stylish""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""Titanium Black"", ""sleek""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""chrome"", ""mannered""],    ""interior"": [""red contrast stitching"", ""sleek"", ""performance-oriented""]  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN T-Roc Cabriolet,"With a market dominated by crossovers and SUVs, making a convertible version for such a vehicle was an unusual approach, and yet, Volkswagen dared to build and offer the T-Roc as a convertible as well. Even though the convertible accounted for a small fraction of the T-Roc's sales, the carmaker decided to go on with it and kept it on the assembly lines. After all, it was the only crossover convertible on the market, and Volkswagen didn't want to let that advantage go. For the facelifted version, the T-Roc received a similar treatment as its stablemates. Yet, there were a few details that made it special, apart from the folding fabric roof. For instance, the front fascia was similar to the regular T-Roc, but at the back, the trunk lid received a lip spoiler. It wasn't there for a specific aerodynamic advantage but for the vehicle's overall look. For the passenger area, the carmaker used the same dashboard with an 8"" infotainment screen atop the center stack and an option for a 9.2"" unit. In front of the driver, Volkswagen replaced the older analog dials with an 8"" TFT display named Digital Cockpit. A 10.25"" screen dubbed Digital Cockpit Pro was on the options list. As for the seats, they did look somehow like those from the five-door version, but they were folding and provided more side support even on the standard version. Behind the cabin, the carmaker installed the retractable roof compartment. That pushed the rear bench forward, leading to smaller legroom than on the regular T-Roc. Under the hood, the German carmaker offered the T-Roc with a choice of two engines paired with either a six-speed manual or a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""T-Roc"",  ""year"": ""facelifted"",  ""size"": ""crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""unusual"", ""convertible"", ""special"", ""folding fabric roof"", ""retrofitted lip spoiler""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""folding""],    ""roof"": [""retractable""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""lip""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN T-Roc R,"Volkswagen refreshed the entire T-Roc lineup in 2021, four years after the nameplate introduction on the market. That facelift also included the sportiest version, the R. The R version was the hottest of them and provided a sportier appearance backed up by a more powerful engine. Moreover, with the new upgrades, it looked more aggressive than its non-facelifted sibling. Volkswagen understood that only placing a more powerful engine and standard all-wheel drive won't be enough to justify a much higher price than the rest of the T-Roc range. Thus, it added a shiny-black honeycomb-style grille at the front, crossed by an LED strip for the daytime running lights system that started from headlights. Also, in the redesigned bumper, a pair of vertical LED lamps adorned the side scoops that flanked the center lower grille. From the sides, it was noticeable the lowered ground clearance by 20 mm (0.8"") and the silver caps for the rearview mirrors. At the back, a black roof spoiler completed the sporty image. Thanks to the optional Akrapovic titanium exhaust system, the fake tips in the back were replaced by real ones. Inside, the carmaker installed sport seats with higher bolsters on the sides and exclusive upholstery. Also, it offered the option for a body-colored dashboard. In addition, the driver got the Digital Cockpit Pro 10.25"" TFT display for the instrument panel, while the rest of the range had to cope with the 8"" version. Another improvement was for the infotainment system, which sported the 9.2"" display atop the center stack. But the most crucial aspect of the T-Roc R was the drivetrain, which received the two-liter turbocharged gasoline engine. It provided 300 hp and was paired with a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox that sent the power in all corners.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""T-Roc"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""aggressive"", ""shiny-black"", ""exclusive"", ""lowered""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""honeycomb-style"", ""LED strip""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""redesigned"", ""vertical LED lamps"", ""side scoops""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""black spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""black""],    ""exhaust"": [""Akrapovic titanium"", ""real tips""]  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Golf GTI / GTD / GTE,"The inventor of the hot-hatch category is back with a new version. Of course, we are talking about the Golf GTI from Volkswagen. It is one of the icon cars of the automotive industry. Millions and millions of fans around the globe waited for this eighth generation of the GTI. Despite that it is based on the same MQB platform, launched with the third generation of Audi A3 in 2012, the Golf has succeeded to leave a good impression and the GTI version came with some pretty good improvements. The DCC (Dynamic Chassis Control) system is one of those updates. It continuously reacts to the road surface and driving situations while measuring the steering inputs, braking and acceleration. The main assistance is made to improve comfort depending on the road smoothness, adjusting the four shock absorbers or strengthening them for a sportier driving mode. The DCC also has different pre-set profiles: COMFORT, ECO and SPORT. Plus an “Individual” mode, which can be tailored as desired by the user. The engine used in the Golf GTI is a 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline unit. It offers 245 hp and 370 Nm (272 lb.ft) of torque. It is coupled as standard to a 6-speed manual gearbox, but a 7-speed DSG dual-clutch is offered extra. No data regarding its performance was issued at the time of the publishing.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Golf GTI"",  ""year"": ""eighth generation"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""iconic"", ""improved""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Golf Variant,"Based on the same MQB platform as the regular, eighth generation, of the Volkswagen Golf, the Variant was the station-wagon version for the well-known German compact car. Ever since the third generation of the Volkswagen Golf, the German car-maker offered its most known product in a family version, with a bigger trunk area. While most of the credits are usually going for the 5-door or the 3-door versions, the station-wagon was very well sold all over the world. The eighth generation of the Golf featured a slimmer front fascia, with narrow headlights extended on the upper side with “eyebrows” swept on the fenders. The front bumper featured a wide grill in the apron with horizontal slats that visually made the car looks wider. Up to the A-pillars, the car looked the same as the hatchback, but the longer roof and the back were different. A set of side windows was placed behind the rear door and the raked tailgate completed the car. Inside, the Golf Variant featured the same dashboard as the regular Golf, with that clean look for the dashboard, uncluttered by too many buttons. The 8.25” touch-screen infotainment display was installed in a floating design trend, on top of the center stack, and close to the instrument cluster. The automatic gearbox selector was placed on the center console, like a mini-joystick. Under the hood, the Golf Variant featured a mild-hybrid system powered by a turbocharged gasoline engine with direct fuel injection. It was mated to a 7-speed automatic transmission (DSG – dual-clutch).",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Volkswagen Golf Variant"",  ""year"": ""eighth generation"",  ""size"": ""station-wagon"",  ""overall-design"": [""slimmer front fascia"", ""narrow headlights"", ""wide grill"", ""clean dashboard"", ""floating infotainment display""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wide"", ""horizontal slats""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""narrow"", ""extended"", ""swept""],    ""bumper"": [""wide""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""5-door"", ""3-door""],    ""roof"": [""longer""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Tiguan Allspace,"Volkswagen created the Tiguan Allspace to compensate for the lack of an affordable seven-seat SUV but managed to stay away from its bigger brother, the Touareg, customers. Despite the world pandemic situation, Volkswagen had to refresh the Tiguan range, and it did it. Working with uninfected or healed workers, it managed to keep its production lines rolling, and the 2021 model year rolled out from the assembly lines in autumn 2020. That was just the beginning. Since the Allspace was just the extended version of the Tiguan, it was normal that it will receive an update as well. At the front, like its five-seat sibling, the Tiguan Allspace featured a more striking grille with illuminated strips and a reshaped VW badge in the middle. Its LED headlights were enhanced and received 24 individual LEDs, which could adjust their light for different situations. The system was first implemented on the Touareg. Inside, the carmaker offered its newest version of the control panel for the climate control system, with a touch-screen and sliders on the center stack. The seven seats remained similar to those installed on the previous, non-facelifted model. Strangely, the Allspace offered less trunk space than its five-seat sibling, offering up to 1,755 liters of space instead of the 1,920 liters provided by its smaller brother, with all the seats folded down. Under the hood, Volkswagen installed a choice of five engines: three turbo-diesels and two turbocharged gasoline units.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Tiguan Allspace"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""extended"",  ""overall-design"": [""striking grille"", ""enhanced LED headlights"", ""refreshed control panel"", ""seven seats"", ""choice of five engines""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""striking"", ""illuminated"", ""reshaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""enhanced"", ""LED"", ""adjustable""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Golf Alltrack,"Based on the station-wagon version of the Volkswagen Golf VIII, the Alltrack was the lifted and all-wheel-drive version for the well-known German compact vehicle. In the mid-'80s, Volkswagen unveiled one of the first cross-over vehicles on the market. It was known as Golf Country and it was an all-wheel-drive and lifted 5-door Golf. It was not the time and it was not very successful. Over time, the customers started to look for vehicles that offered a higher ground clearance in compact-size bodyworks. The eighth generation of the Golf was unveiled in October 2019 and it was one of the last major models unveiled live before the COVID 19 pandemic started. The Golf Alltrack was based on the station-wagon version of the Golf. It offered a higher ground clearance and a rougher look like it would like to go camping. The LED foglights, the side sills, and the slim gray trims around the wheel-arches are emphasizing the cross-over look of the car. On top of that, a pair of roof-rails was installed. Inside, the Golf Alltrack featured the same interior as the Golf Variant, with that clean look for the dashboard, uncluttered by too many buttons. The 8.25” touch-screen infotainment display was installed in a floating design trend, on top of the center stack, and close to the instrument cluster. The automatic gearbox selector was placed on the center console, like a mini-joystick. Under the hood, the Alltrack featured a mild-hybrid system powered by a turbocharged gasoline engine.

VOLKSWAGEN Arteon,"Volkswagen didn't rest on its laurels after launching the Arteon lineup in 2020 and brought some significant improvements to the vehicle for the 2022 model year. After it dropped the Phaeton, the Arteon remained Volkswagen's flagship sedan. Even though it was based on the same scalable MQB platform shared with most other stablemates. For the 2022 model year, the sporty-looking vehicle was available in three trim levels: SE R-Line, SEL R-Line, and SEL Premium R-Line. All three versions featured the R-Line pack both inside and out. For the 2022 model year, the aggressive stance was emphasized by the contoured hood lines that emerged on the main grille. Furthermore, the base version featured standard 18"" light-alloy wheels, while the SEL R-Line was available with 20"" ones. Finally, the Premium R-Line was offered with standard 20"" alloys. In addition, the middle and top versions got an illuminated light bar in the grille to complement the LED daytime running lights. Also, the LED headlights were fitted as standard on the entire range. Inside, all versions had a three-zone Climatronic Touch HVAC system as standard. In addition, for cold weather, all versions received standard heated front seats. At the same time, the Premium L-Line featured heated and ventilated four seats. In addition to the standard MIB3 touchscreen infotainment, the German automaker offered Sirius XM with 360L and a 700-Watt harman/kardon audio with 12 speakers, including a subwoofer. The high-quality sound system was standard for the Premium L-Line. Apart from the SE R-Line, fitted with FWD-only, the rest of the range featured a 4Motion all-wheel-drive system. However, the most significant upgrade was under the hood, where the automaker installed a 300 hp (304 PS) turbocharged inline-four paired with a seven-speed automatic gearbox.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Arteon"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""mid-size sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""aggressive"", ""elegant"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""contoured""],    ""grille"": [""illuminated"", ""aggressive""],    ""hood"": [""contoured""],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""18-inch"", ""20-inch"", ""alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""turbocharged""]  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Tiguan,"Volkswagen introduced the third generation of its compact SUV, Tiguan, in 2023, and it was a big step forward for the vehicle compared to its predecessor in terms of styling, technology, and features. The Tiguan started its career trying to catch up with Nissan Qashqai and losing most of the time. Volkswagen didn’t have the reputation of a 4x4 car maker, so its products suffered in that segment. But the German automaker didn’t give up and pushed harder on the market. The second generation, which it launched in 2016, performed better and took the crown as the best-selling VW. By 2023, the Tiguan had reached 7.6 million units sold and was on its way to success. That’s why its creator tried to make a better car and surprise its customers in a good way. With styling cues carried over from its bigger brother, the Touareg, the Tiguan looked more up-scale than its predecessor. Strangely, there was no grille above the massive bumper, just a lower one needed to cool the engine and a pair of side scoops that housed a pair of air intakes. The LED headlights showed a new, more angular design than on the Tiguan’s second generation and flanked a strip that supported the carmaker’s badge. From its profile, the compact SUV revealed its sculptured doors and the widened rear quarter panels, creating a muscular image for the Tiguan. Finally, at the back, the tilted forward tailgate sported a roof spoiler. Also, at the back, customers could notice the lack of any exhaust, not even fake ones. For the sporty version, Volkswagen added piano-black trims at the front bumper, the B- and C-pillars, and the rear bumper. Inside, the third generation of the Tiguan boasted a more luxurious cabin than its predecessor. It now featured a standard 10” instrument cluster and up to 15” touchscreen for the infotainment system. Just like the rest of the Volkswagen range, the multimedia unit didn’t feature a dedicated volume knob, but the automaker thought slightly differently. Volkswagen listened to its clients and ditched the touch-buttons from the steering wheel and replaced them with physical ones, which was a good thing. Between the front seats on the center console, it installed a rotary dial with its own touch-button inside that could control several systems, including the volume. The front occupants could access it from their comfortable seats designed for long journeys. In the back, the carmaker installed a split-folding bench seat that could expand the 652-liter (23 cu-ft.) trunk. Volkswagen built the Tiguan on the MQB evo platform and installed a choice of hybrid, gasoline, or diesel drivetrains. All of them were prepared for the Euro 7 emission standards and provided not just good performance but also low fuel consumption figures. Furthermore, the 2023 iteration of the Tiguan was the first to completely ditch the manual gearboxes and featured just dual-clutch ones for the entire range.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Tiguan"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""compact SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""up-scale"", ""muscular"", ""luxurious"", ""sporty"", ""angular""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""massive"", ""lower""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""angular""],    ""bumper"": [""massive""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured"", ""widened""],    ""roof"": [""tilted"", ""spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof""],    ""exhaust"": [""lack of any""]  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Amarok,"The Volkswagen Amarok came to fruition in 2010 as a result of extensive work that started back in 2005. As a mid-size pickup truck, it fulfills the need for ample cargo space, transporting goods with a very high volume while satisfying the need for a comfortable car in day-to-day life. While being a standard for quality, the new Amarok succeeds in filling the boots of the last generation regarding practicability, reliability, and versatility. The new model encapsulates all the off-road capabilities of its predecessor in a way more impressive package, using up-to-date materials and technology to provide its users with a well-rounded experience. The interior is marked by the leather inserts on the instrument panel and on the door trim surfaces and by the digital cockpit, which optionally can have up to 12 inches. A high-end Harman Kardon audio system accompanies all the delicate touches. The model is based on the Ford T6 platform and shares multiple features with the Ford Ranger and the Ford Everest, making it quite a unique Volkswagen. It comes in four variants: Life, Style, PanAmericana and Aventura. The options vary from a standard-equipped truck to a premium one ready to take on tough off-road challenges. The customizability extends even to the engine and transmission, and the car can have a rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive complemented by an engine ranging from an inline four 2.0 L to a V6 3.0 L capable of 236 horsepower. The Amarok also has an impressive towing capacity of 7000 lbs, made possible by the automatic transmission, which enhances the engine's power in the best way possible. From the standpoint of cargo capacity, the loading area can impressively fit a Euro pallet loaded sideways between the wheel arches and has sturdy eyelets that can help fix it. Volkswagen offers the option of a hard top or a roll cover, marketed as accessories meant to help you accommodate different types of cargo in the back of your truck. Also, the roof has a load capacity of 700 pounds, more than enough to pitch a tent or have some extra storage while camped. Regarding camping, the new model aspires to handle well all the off-road encounters that may interfere with a smooth and fun drive. For instance, the fording depth was extended by 11 inches, totaling a staggering 31 inches. This feature may help you get to previously unreachable spots where you can set your camp deep into the wilderness. The charm of the Amarok is that while it can perform outstandingly on various terrains, it can also be the smooth ride you enjoy on your daily commute to work, making you feel pleased when you spend time near the truck or in it, while you're stuck in traffic.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Volkswagen Amarok"",  ""year"": ""2010"",  ""size"": ""mid-size pickup truck"",  ""overall-design"": [""practical"", ""reliable"", ""versatile"", ""premium"", ""off-road capable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""stylish""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""digital"", ""high-end""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""sturdy""],    ""doors"": [""customizable""],    ""roof"": [""spacious"", ""strong""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Golf 5 Doors,"Volkswagen had been producing the Golf VII for 5 years now, and the Golf VIII is a very important model. It shares the same chassis with its older brother, and we could say that the Golf VIII’s interior looks pretty avant-garde, having two large touchscreens. They can be used with gesture controls as well. The rather clean design has no physical buttons and is equipped with touch sensitive surfaces. For the automatic transmission, the regular lever has been replaced by a little paddle. In front of the paddle there’s a surface that allows wireless charging for the phone. The infotainment system has sharp graphics and the driver and passengers can connect their drives via the Apple Car play or the Android Auto. For Android users, the device can only be connected with a wire. Voice commands are also available for this model. For example, the driver could ask the intelligent system to start heating the seat(s). The car can also be equipped with Automatic Park Assist, Adaptive Cruise Control with predictive speed detection. The new Golf is super easy to drive and has good visibility. The steering is both nice and light. It is equipped with progressive brakes, but very efficient in case of emergency.

VOLKSWAGEN Passat GTE,"Just like the pre-facelift version, the refreshed 2019 Volkswagen Passat GTE is based on the standard Passat sedan and is the second of it's kind to be powered by a plug-in hybrid system, offering over 1,000 km of total driving range. After no less than 30 million Passat models have been produced over the span of 7 generations, the eighth iteration of the nameplate in GTE guise was unveiled in 2019. Thanks to new hardware and software, the new Digital Cockpit has been massively improved compared to the previous Active Info Display. With much enhanced graphics and improved features, the system now offers three various display configurations can be customized using the redesigned multifunction steering wheel. Still part of the Passat lineup, the GTE plug-in hybrid has received a considerably higher all-electric range, with up to 55 kilometers being covered in the WLTP cycle, which correspond to approximately 70 kilometers in the old NEDC. Visually, the Passat GTE is still very similar with its standard version, with minor changes to the front end consisting of a specific chrome radiator grille with a blue line, C-shaped LED daytime running lights as well as chrome bladed lower side air intakes. The interior is decorated with blue stitching and ambient lighting while the display system has been modified for integration with the hybrid drive system. Mechanically, the GTE still gets motivated by the same a turbocharged direct injection gasoline unit mated with an electric motor offering a total of 218 horsepower. It can reach 130 kph in pure electric mode and over 220 kph in hybrid mode, where both powerplants work in tandem.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Volkswagen Passat GTE"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""standard sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""modern"", ""sleek"", ""stylish""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""chrome"", ""specific"", ""blue-lined""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""C-shaped LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Passat Alltrack,"With over 30 million Passat models manufactured over the span of 7 generations, the mid-cycle facelift of the eighth iteration of the nameplate in station wagon Alltrack guise was unveiled in 2019, alongside the other members of the Passat family. Just like its platform brothers, the revamped Passat Alltrack has received a cornucopia of technology, most of it having trickled down from some of the more expensive car brands under the Volkswagen Group umbrella. In other words the eighth generation of the Volkswagen Passat has received one of the most technologically advanced mid-cycle facelifts in its history. Thanks to new hardware and software, the new Digital Cockpit has been massively improved compared to the previous Active Info Display. With much enhanced graphics and improved features, the system now offers three various display configurations can be customized using the redesigned multifunction steering wheel. Still with the Passat Variant used as the base model, the Alltrack is now a lot more up to date compared to its rivals.

VOLKSWAGEN e-UP!,"In production relatively unchanged since 2013, the Volkswagen e-Up! received a rather substantial mid-cycle facelift in 2019. Part of a multi-billion euros electric vehicle offensive that also includes all-new cars from the ID. lineup, the refreshed e-Up! features a brand new battery, which offers increased range, and an even more competitive price compared to its predecessor. The visual enhancements are minimal, with the overall design language being largely identical to the old model. The new Lithium-ion battery has a capacity that has been almost doubled, from 18.7 to 36.8 kWh, of which 32.3 kWh comprise usable energy. Thanks to an average energy consumption of around 12.9 kWh/100 km, the revamped VW e-Up! can achieve a range of up to 260 kilometers from a single charge. Using direct current from the optional CCS charging connection, the model can be recharged from 0 to 80 percent in a single hour. With alternative current from a 7.2 kW socket, the battery can be charged at the same 80 percent in a little over four hours.

VOLKSWAGEN Passat Variant GTE,"With over 30 million Passats manufactured over the span of seven distinct generations, the eighth iteration of the nameplate in plug-in hybrid Variant GTE guise was unveiled in 2019 alongside other versions of the mid-sized model. With tons of features infused in the revamped model, most of it having been borrowed from the more premium car brands under the Volkswagen Group umbrella, the eighth generation of the Volkswagen Passat has received one of the most technologically advanced mid-cycle facelifts in the model's history. Inside, mostly thanks to new hardware and software, the new Digital Cockpit has been massively improved compared to the previous Active Info Display. With much enhanced graphics and improved features, the system now offers three various display configurations can be customized using the redesigned multifunction steering wheel. The GTE plug-in hybrid has received a considerably higher all-electric range, with up to 55 kilometers being covered in the WLTP cycle, which correspond to approximately 70 kilometers in the old NEDC. Most of the changes that With the electric motor being paired with a turbocharged internal combustion engine, the combined maximum output of the two is a healthy 218 horsepower when used in hybrid mode.

VOLKSWAGEN Golf Sportsvan,"Volkswagen introduced a new generation of its Golf-based MPV Sportsvan in 2014 and added a mid-life cycle refresh three years later. Volkswagen introduced the Golf Plus in 2004 and kept it on the market until 2014 when it replaced it with the Golf Sportvan, an MPV based on the same platform as the Golf MK7. After its more notorious sibling received a mid-life cycle impulse, the minivan brother followed and got refreshed. At the front, the 2017 model featured a new pair of headlights with standard halogen lamps and LED daytime running lights. As an option, the carmaker provided the Sportvan with full-LEDs instead of Xenon brights. In addition, the front bumper received an updated look with sharp, angular lines that evoked a sportier design. At the back, the carmaker added LED taillights fitted as standard for the entire range. Inside, Volkswagen upgraded the infotainment system. It introduced an eight-inch screen as standard with an option for a Discover Pro unit that featured a 9.2"" display on the center stack. Additionally, the carmaker provided an option for an interface named Media Control, which the owner could install on a smartphone or tablet, enhancing the onboard experience. Depending on the countries, the Sportsvan came equipped with a WiFi hot-spot. As part of the safety package, the carmaker added automatic braking features, including pedestrian detection. Under the hood, the 2017 Sportsvan ditched the famous turbo-diesel engines from its lineup for specific markets but kept two of them for the European customers. Its gasoline units ranged between 85 hp and 150 hp.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Golf Sportvan"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""angular"", ""updated"", ""enhanced"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""sharp"", ""full-LED"", ""halogen"", ""angular""],    ""bumper"": [""sharp"", ""angular"", ""sportier""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN up!,"Volkswagen introduced a restyled up! at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show and showed an extensive personalization program that could make any car almost tailor-made. The German styling culture was almost every time based on the form follows function theme, and so was the up! While the Italians sacrificed some features and knee room or headroom for the design's sake, Germans never did that. The French were somewhere in the middle road. Back to the up! With a look that could conquer the hearts of a geometry lover, the up! showed a new front fascia with LED daytime running lights. The grille was just a thin line between the hood's edge and the wrapped-around plastic bumper. An additional cooling area found its place under the license plate area, flanked by a pair of optional fog lights. In the three-door version, the up! Provided access through its wide doors. The greenhouse looked like a cube with a raked windshield at the front and a vertical drop at the back. Thanks to the wheels pushed to the corners, the up! looked prepared for small parking spaces and mall parking lots. Inside, there was a new dashboard design, which was available in six different colors. On the center stack, the carmaker relied on customers' smartphones for pretty much everything, from music player to navigation. A special cradle sat on top of the vehicle's radio. In front of the driver, Volkswagen mounted a rounded-shaped instrument cluster. For seating, the carmaker confirmed that it was, in the best-case scenario, a four-seat vehicle. It offered enough legroom and headroom on the two-seat bench. Under the hood, Volkswagen installed an inline-three, either naturally aspirated or turbocharged.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""up!"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""geometric"", ""functional"", ""tailor-made"", ""compact"", ""stylish""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""raked""],    ""grille"": [""thin"", ""integrated""],    ""hood"": [""wrapped-around""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""daytime running""],    ""bumper"": [""plastic""],    ""wheel"": [""corner-pushed""],    ""doors"": [""wide""],    ""roof"": [""cube-shaped"", ""vertical drop""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Caddy,"The fifth generation of the small VW carrier was shown in 2020 and the news about it are rather interesting. It is the first VW commercial vehicle that uses the MQB platform. The first Caddy was based on the VW Golf Mk1 and it was named the Rabbit Pickup in North America. The second generation was based on the VW Polo and the third on a small Czech utility vehicle, the Skoda Favorit. The fourth generation had its own mix of components, from Polo and Golf plus some other parts specially engineered for it. The 2020 generation received more passenger-type characteristics, in order to be more like a family-car for a small entrepreneur, contractor or handyman. In its longest variant, the Caddy can be loaded with two Euro pallets of cargo, sideways or via the rear doors. Power comes from a turbodiesel in two power outputs (75hp and 122hp), a turbo-gasoline (TSI) unit with 116 hp and a turbocharged natural-gas engine (TGI). These options are made to meet the strictest 2021 emission standards. For instance, the TDI versions have a double SCR (emission control system) to lower the NOX figures. The interior for the 2020 Caddy is enhanced, being more like a car and less like a van. It even has an infotainment unit with a touchscreen of up to 10” in size.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""VW Caddy"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""family-car"", ""commercial"", ""enhanced interior"", ""passenger-type"", ""compact""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""small"", ""modern""],    ""hood"": [""compact""],    ""headlights"": [""modern""],    ""bumper"": [""functional""],    ""wheel"": [""spacious"", ""functional""],    ""doors"": [""sliding"", ""functional""],    ""roof"": [""sleek""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN e-Golf,"The electric revolution caught the imagination of Golf lovers who looked at the German carmaker to offer them a reason not to buy a Nissan Leaf. Volkswagen was looking to pay its sins from Dieselgate, and the e-Golf was the perfect answer. With its zero-emissions from the pipe and the smooth promised driving experience, it enchanted its fans with an electric Golf. The first model was introduced in 2014 and, just two years later, the Golf was changed and updated. In 2016, the seventh generation of the Golf received a mid-life cycle impulse that brought new technologies and a slightly different look on it. The e-Golf, even though it was just two years old, had to follow its siblings and showed a LED headlights and taillights. Its bumpers were refreshed as well. The e-Golf was the only version in its range that showed a C-letter pattern daytime running lights in the front bumpers. In the rear, Volkswagen installed fake chromed exhausts on the bottom of the bumper. It was an unusual and illogical decision. Inside, it was the same digital instrument cluster. Volkswagen offered a new Discover Pro infotainment system fitted with a 9.2” glass-display on the center stack. It provided a gesture control system and a fully configurable home screen. The most important change was under the... floor. Volkswagen installed a new battery with an increased storage capacity from 24.2 kWh to 35.8 kWh thanks to the lithium-ion technology. The motor was also new and developed 19 more hp, reaching a total of 134 that could rocket the car from 0 to 60 mph (0-97 kph) a second faster than its predecessor.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Golf"",  ""year"": ""2016"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""electric"", ""smooth"", ""refreshed"", ""digital"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""taillights""],    ""bumper"": [""refreshed"", ""C-letter pattern daytime running lights"", ""fake chromed exhausts""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""fake chromed""]  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Touran,"The third generation of the Touran was introduced at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show. The MPV was more stylish than before and it featured more comfort and safety amenities. Like most of the Volkswagen range, the Touran was developed on the MQB platform. It was fitted with an automatic post-collision braking system, adaptive cruise control, and city emergency braking. It also featured pre-crash proactive protection, side assist, and rear traffic alert. From the design point of view, the Touran featured a grille inspired by its three-box sibling, the Jetta. With its chromed longitudinal lines which were stretched from one headlight to another, it made the MPV look wider. The Touran was fit between the Golf Plus and the Sharan. Inside, there was room for seven passengers with seven individual seats in the middle row, which could slide and tilt. The last row was fit for children. When folded, the second and third-row made a flat platform that expanded the trunk space. The dashboard was minimalist, in the Volkswagen style. The infotainment system supported Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. For the drivetrain, the Touran was offered with a choice of three versions of turbodiesels and three turbocharged gasoline units. Most versions came mated as standard with a 6-speed manual, while for the top versions (one diesel and one gasoline) a 7-Speed DSG (dual-clutch system) was fitted as standard.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Touran"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""MPV"",  ""overall-design"": [""stylish"", ""wide"", ""minimalist"", ""comfortable"", ""safety-oriented""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""chromed"", ""wide""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Scirocco R,"The first generation of the Scirocco was launched in 1974 and ended its production in 1981. In the same year, Volkswagen released the 2nd generation intended to last until 1988 when they proposed the Corrado. As the Corrado was not a very successful model, they continued to sell the Scirocco second generation until 1992. Volkswagen decides to revive the Scirocco nameplate in 2008. In 2014, Volkswagen brought a refreshed version of the Scirocco. As the changes are minor, it takes a good eye to spot the design differences. The front end was slightly modified, with a refreshed bumper, new fog lamps and full LED headlights. In the back, the rear bumper got black air vents – they had no real use, but we must admit the back of the car looks better. The rear headlights are now equipped with LEDs as well. All in all, the front of the car has a more sportier, aggressive look with the arrival of the face-lift, compared to its predecessor. The exit pipes were mounted on both sides, while its predecessor had two exit pipes on the same side. The sporty model comes with a 6-speed manual or a DSG dual clutch automatic transmission. The most powerful engine mounted on this car is the 275 bhp 2-liter 4-cylinder turbocharged petrol. The power is routed to the wheels through an AWD system. The R model brings a stiffer suspension and optional adaptive dampers. The interior was updated with new colors, the R having the “Race” seat covers with the R logo. The new materials and the new steering wheel were borrowed from the sibling Golf GTI. The seats make you feel connected to the road due to their low position. The steering is very accurate and offers good feedback, a really important aspect of a sporty car. Three auxiliary instruments were added on the dashboard: turbo pressure, engine oil temperature and chronometer. The suspension was lowered by 10mm.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Scirocco"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""aggressive"", ""refreshed"", ""minor changes"", ""full LED headlights""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""full LED""],    ""bumper"": [""refreshed"", ""sportier"", ""aggressive""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""dual exit pipes"", ""mounted on both sides""],    ""interior"": [""new colors"", ""low-positioned seats"", ""new materials"", ""new steering wheel"", ""auxiliary instruments""]  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Scirocco,"In 2008, Volkswagen decided to revive the Scirocco name. Like its predecessor, it was based on the same platform with the Golf but offered a sportier look. It was one of the sexiest cars made by the German brand. The first generation of Scirocco was introduced in 1974 and it was followed by a second-generation in 1981, which remained on the market until 1992. It was overlapped for a few years by its more powerful but less successful brother Corrado, between 1988 and 1995. After that, no other sport-compact car was offered by Volkswagen, until 2008. Despite the bad world economy, the third generation was introduced in 2008, but it was well-received by the market. In 2014, it was refreshed. It featured new LED strips inside the headlights and a new bumper with new fog-lights inside. In the back, the facelifted version featured a small line over the tailgate. The new taillights design was enhanced by LEDs. The interior featured sport-bucket seats and leather sport steering wheel carried-over from the Golf GTI fitted as standard. There were more new configurations and a new Dynaudio sound system for the infotainment unit, that included the sat-nav. For the drivetrain, the Scirocco featured a choice of gasoline and diesel engines. Most of the buyers preferred the latter since they offered good performance and they were very fuel-efficient.

VOLKSWAGEN Gol,"Volkswagen Gol was the most successful car on the Brazilian market and it was produced since 1980 as a replacement for the popular VW Beetle. In 2014, the car already reached its third generation. In 1980, Volkswagen was looking for a way to replace the cheap and reliable Volkswagen Beetle on the South-American market. It was just very hard to create something affordable to buy and cheap to run. So, the first generation was made on a mix of platforms and an air-cooled VW Beetle engine but mounted in the front. As the years went by, the car grew and changed market expectations. The 2014 model was a facelift for the 2008 model. It featured a look closer to the European Polo in some details such as the headlights and the taillights. The Gol was available in a few shapes and sizes such as hatchback, sedan, or even as a pickup. The front bumper with a honeycomb lower grille and other stylistic details were unusual for a car from its segment. Inside, the instrument cluster featured the same layout as from a European Volkswagen Golf 6, with an LCD display between the tachometer and the speedometer. The audio system looked like a carry-over from an older generation of Volkswagen products on the standard trim level, but a modern infotainment unit with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity was available. For the engine, the Gol was available with a choice of two units of 1.0- and 1.6-liter. Both engines featured flex-fuel systems, with either gasoline or ethanol. The standard transmission was a 5-speed manual, and an option for 5- or 6-speed automatic was on the options list.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Volkswagen Gol"",  ""year"": ""2014"",  ""size"": ""hatchback, sedan, pickup"",  ""overall-design"": [""affordable"", ""stylistic"", ""modern"", ""flexible"", ""reliable""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""front-mounted""],    ""grille"": [""honeycomb""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""European-inspired""],    ""bumper"": [""front with honeycomb lower grille""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Sharan,"After selling more than 600,000 units in 15 years of the Sharan's first generation, Volkswagen introduced its successor at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. Volkswagen and Ford formed a joint venture to build MPVs and resulted in the Sharan and Galaxy, respectively, but in 2010 the blue-oval badge brand dropped the ball, and Volkswagen had to decide if it would continue the project on its own. And it did it, launching the second generation of the Sharan, which was still produced at the same factory as its predecessor. Since it was left alone on this project, the German carmaker used the same PQ46 platform used on the Passat. The design was sharper, with clear lines and angular-shaped headlights that resembled a similar look as the rest of the Volkswagen's range, following a common design language. Even though it looked more like a taller station wagon, the Sharan featured rear sliding doors fitted as standard. Moreover, it was fitted with LED daytime running lights and offered with an option for bi-xenon headlights. Inside, the seven-seat cabin, with a 2-3-2 layout, provided enough room for adult-sized passengers on the first and middle rows, while the third was more appropriate for children. The dashboard's design was inspired by the Passat, with a tall center stack that was continued on the center console. It comprised the infotainment unit placed on top. The instrument cluster featured two larger dials for the speedometer and tachometer that flanked a small TFT display for the onboard computer. By folding all the seats, apart from the driver's one, the Sharan could reach up to 2,430 liters (85.8 cu-ft) of storage space. Under the hood, the carmaker installed a wide choice of diesel and gasoline engines paired to either a six-speed manual or a 5- or 6-speed automatic.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Sharan"",  ""year"": ""2010"",  ""size"": ""MPV"",  ""overall-design"": [""sharp"", ""angular-shaped"", ""taller station wagon"", ""clear lines"", ""LED daytime running lights""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""sharp""],    ""headlights"": [""angular-shaped"", ""bi-xenon option""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""rear sliding"", ""seven-seat cabin""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Polo Sedan,"The Polo sedan was a good choice for the emergent markets, for the families that didn't want to share the cabin with their luggage compartment. Small, nimble, and light, the Polo sedan was a great choice for countries where the three-box version was considered more upmarket than the hatchbacks. In the ASEAN market, Russia, and specific market, Volkswagen offered a three-box version for its well-known Polo from the fifth generation. From the outside, the Polo Sedan featured the same front fascia as the rest of the range, with angular-looking headlights and a two-slats grille design with chromed accents. Depending on the trim level, the aerodynamically profiled bumper featured a pair of round fog lights installed on the outer section. In the middle, the carmaker installed an additional grille to cool the engine. The three-box version featured a third triangular window behind the rear C-pillar and a sloped D-pillar from its sides. Its taillights were mounted only on the rear quarter panels. Inside, the Polo Sedan offered adequate space for four passengers but with limited legroom for the rear seat occupants. The carmaker installed a pair of seats designed for comfort rather than for spirited driving at the front. While the dashboard design was similar to the sedan version, but with a slightly different instrument panel design, especially for the tachometer and speedometer. Depending on the market, the Polo Sedan was available either with two gasoline engines or a 1.5-liter turbodiesel.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Polo Sedan"",  ""year"": ""fifth generation"",  ""size"": ""small, nimble, light"",  ""overall-design"": [""angular-looking headlights"", ""two-slats grille design with chromed accents"", ""aerodynamically profiled bumper"", ""triangular window behind the rear C-pillar"", ""sloped D-pillar"", ""taillights mounted on the rear quarter panels"", ""adequate space for four passengers"", ""limited legroom for the rear seat occupants"", ""comfortable front seats"", ""similar dashboard design with a slightly different instrument panel design""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""two-slats"", ""chromed accents""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angular-looking""],    ""bumper"": [""aerodynamically profiled"", ""pair of round fog lights""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN ID.5 GTX,"When Volkswagen introduced the GTI badge on the Golf back in the '70s, it didn't know how much of an impact those three letters would make on the market. So the GTX version of the ID.5 tried to tell the same story to its customers: this is the special version. Since the ID.5 was a crossover SUV, it didn't feel appropriate to place the same GTI badge on it. Moreover, since it's an electric vehicle, telling that it features a fuel-injected engine wouldn't be something to brag about. But that X was placed there to suggest an all-wheel drive system. This top version featured the same shape, but there were quite a few details that made a difference. At the front, the GTX featured a wide trapezoidal grille. Inside the vertical side-scoops, the carmaker placed three LED lights, which were not available on the regular ID.5. Another small detail was on the greenhouse. Finally, while the non-GTX version sported a body-colored side arch, the more powerful version featured a black one. Inside, ID.5 GTX featured sport bucket seats with higher side bolstering. So even though it's hard to believe that someone bought it to race it around town, the carmaker installed seats that provided the much-needed side support. Also, like its sibling, it featured a TFT display mounted on the steering-wheel column, so it moved together when the driver needed to adjust the wheel. The most crucial difference between these stablemates was for the drivetrain, where the GTX was all-wheel-drive. It was also more powerful, providing almost 300 ponies to the German crossover SUV-coupe.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""ID.5"",  ""year"": ""2020s"",  ""size"": ""crossover SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""special version"", ""electric"", ""all-wheel drive"", ""sporty"", ""powerful""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""wide"", ""trapezoidal""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""body-colored"", ""black""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN ID.5,"Volkswagen made a surprising move when it introduced the ID.4 on the market. The carmaker said that it was just part of its beginning in the electric trend. Then, the ID.5 came to prove that. While the ID.4 emphasized family and traditional-looking vehicles, the ID.5 was a step further. VW made it for those looking for a sporty yet ecological vehicle. While both cars shared the same platform, the ID.5 was a clear evolution in more areas, not just from the design point of view. At the front, the car kept the same LED headlights as its sibling. Even though it sported a grille-like part above the bumper, it was actually a closed panel, crossed from side to side by an LED daytime running light. Like the ID.4, it features a lower grille to help cool the batteries and the electrical system. Up to the B-pillar, the car looked similar to its more conventional-looking sibling. After that, the sloped roofline created a coupe-like styling up to the wide liftgate. A small wing with an LED third braking light added an air of sportiness. To complete the car's sport-oriented profile, Volkswagen installed a set of 21"" light-alloy wheels. Inside, despite the sloped roof, the car was roomy enough for four adult passengers. In front of the driver, a minimalist-looking dashboard featured a center stack with a 12"" infotainment screen. In addition, a head-up display was on the options list. As for the trunk, since the car was slightly longer than ID.4, it had the same 549 liters (19.4 cu-ft) of space. The ID.5 was available with a rear-wheel drive setup in two power options: 176 hp and 204 hp.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""ID.5"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""roomy, coupe-like"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""ecological"", ""conventional-looking"", ""minimalist"", ""roomy""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""closed"", ""LED""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""lower grille""],    ""wheel"": [""21\"" light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloped"", ""coupe-like""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""small wing with LED""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Golf GTD Variant,"The first Volkswagen Golf GTD was launched in 1982 and the first station-wagon Golf was introduced in 1993. In 2015, the two elements were combined, forming the first Golf GTD Variant. At the 2015 Geneva Motor Show, the German car-maker introduced the first station-wagon GTD for the Volkswagen Golf. The new version transformed the Golf into a fast-paced family mover. But it wasn't just a station-wagon with a more powerful engine. It came with a complete package. From the outside, the Golf GTD Variant (station-wagon) showed a different front fascia than other siblings. It featured a bigger, wider, opening into the front spoiler. Two additional wide air-intakes were placed on the sides and with the optional LED fog-lights inside. A gray strip ran along the front fascia, at the bottom of the grille and inside the standard bi-Xenon headlights. It was specific to the GTD versions. In the rear, a roof spoiler and a twin-chromed exhaust were installed. The smoked taillights were specific for the GTD station-wagon. Inside, the front seats were upholstered in classic ""Clark""-style GT tartan design. The standard ambient lighting and the “Composition Touch” radio system were fitted as standard. Regarding the trunk-space, the GTD Variant offered 605 liters (21.3 cu-ft) to the windows line and up to 1620 liters (57.2 cu-ft) with the rear seats folded. The 184 hp engine under the hood was mated to a standard 6-speed manual and a 6-speed auto was offered as an option.

VOLKSWAGEN Transporter Kombi,"The sixth generation of the Transporter was launched in 2015 and it is the most successful commercial vehicle in Germany. The previous generation sold in 2.0 million units. The classic design remained almost the same. It is hard to change a vehicle that knows that in some parts of the world the LCV's are called ""transporters"" regardless of the brand. It is hard to decide either it is a new or a facelift vehicle since the engines, interior, and safety features are new. But the platform remained the same. Even if other vehicles from the VW brand have 2.0-liter turbodiesel engines, VW Commercial Vehicles installed a specially developed unit for themselves. It is available in various power outputs ranging from 82 hp to 204 hp. For the gasoline market, the Transporter is available also with a 2.0-liter TSI, which delivers either 150 hp or 204 hp. Transmissions offered are either 6-speed manuals or 6-speed DSG (dual-clutch) automatic. It is available as FWD or AWD (4Motion) and the latter may be equipped with Hill Descent Control. Inside, there is a new interior with new materials and a new infotainment unit. A new trim level was introduced, named Highline. The name was carried over from the Volkswagen Passenger range and represents the highest trim level for VW automobiles. The german concept of ""forms follows function"" worked in the Transporter. Even if it doesn't have the same nice look of other MPV's on the market, everything is very neat and clean, in a Bauhaus design manner.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Transporter"",  ""year"": ""2015"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""classic"", ""neat"", ""clean"", ""Bauhaus design""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""classic""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Jetta GLI,"Considered by many a Golf GTI with a trunk, the Jetta GLI was the most potent version of the best-selling Volkswagen in more than three decades. The German carmaker refreshed the entire lineup in 2021, three years after the car's introduction on the market. Even though the overall appearance remained the same, there were a few visual differences compared to its predecessor. At the front, the carmaker installed a new bumper that sported LED fog lights for the GLI version. The hexagonal pattern on the grille was black and adorned by a horizontal red slat with two chromed lines. On the lower side, VW placed a black apron with additional cooling areas. In addition, a set of black door mirrors was specifically exclusively for the GLI version, while a set of 18"" black, light-alloy wheels completed the car's aggressive look. Inside, Volkswagen upgraded the infotainment system to the MIB3 level, and the carmaker spoiled the driver with a 10"" digital instrument cluster. In addition, the GLI featured exclusive red stitching on the seats' upholstery on the seats, providing a sporty appearance. The GLI was based on the MQB platform but with multi-link independent rear suspension like its less-powered siblings. Volkswagen also installed an electronically-controlled limited-slip differential, which worked together with the adaptive damping system. Its turbocharged 2.0-liter unit, with direct fuel injection, provided 228 hp. Volkswagen paired it with a standard six-speed manual transmission, while a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) was on the options list.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Jetta GLI"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""potent"", ""refreshed"", ""aggressive"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""hexagonal"", ""black"", ""horizontal"", ""red"", ""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""new"", ""sported"", ""black"", ""additional cooling areas""],    ""wheel"": [""18\"""", ""black"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [""black""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Taigo,"After the SUV coupe evolution, more and more carmakers tried to offer something on that segment, dominated in the beginning by premium brands. But the customers with not-so-deep pockets could only dream of an affordable SUV Coupe. Yet, it came in the shape of the Renault Arkana for the European and South American market, while the US customers were left aside. In 2021, Volkswagen reconsidered its strategy and introduced the Taigo as a crossover coupe based on the same MQB A0 platform as the T-Roc. Its higher ground clearance and sporty-aggressive stance were enhanced by the front fascia, which featured a light strip across the grille, stretched from side to side. The LED daytime running lights surrounded the headlights, with an angular shape on the outer corners. On the lower part of the bumper, the carmaker installed an A-shaped grille that helped to cool the engine. From its side, the roof descended behind the C-pillars in a short fastback style. Its Kamm back design was adorned at the top of the tailgate with a roof spoiler. The back of the car didn’t reveal any big surprises. Volkswagen followed the same horizontal-line design theme that became a common feature for most of its models. Inside, the carmaker offered the MIB3 infotainment system fitted as standard on the entire range. Depending on the options, a digital instrument cluster for the driver. Like the T-Roc, the Taigo provided limited legroom for adults seated on the rear seats. Under the hood, Volkswagen dropped a small engine range with three and four cylinders paired to a five or six-speed manual or a seven-speed (dual-clutch) automatic.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Taigo"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""crossover coupe"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""aggressive"", ""fastback style"", ""Kamm back design"", ""horizontal-line design""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""light strip"", ""stretched"", ""A-shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angular shape"", ""LED daytime running""],    ""bumper"": [""lower part A-shaped grille""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""short fastback style"", ""descended behind C-pillars""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""roof spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN T-Cross,"Volkswagen introduced the T-Cross on the market in 2018 as its smallest crossover available. It built the car on the same MQB-A0 platform as the Polo or the Audi A1. It was a successful model, and customers liked it for its high-quality materials and bold stance, even though it wasn't a big vehicle. Come 2023, the T-Cross broke cover with a refreshed version. With an exterior that challenged most people to play the guessing game of ""spot the differences,"" the T-Cross. At the front, the most significant change was noticeable on the side scoops that Volkswagen placed on the lower bumper. While the 2019 model year had them in a rectangular shape, the 2024 model year came with new, triangular ones, which sported LED daytime running lights on their outer sides. In addition, the plastic element that mimicked an underbody shield was thicker. On the sides, the only noticeable change was for the wheels, which got redesigned. Still, the black plastic moldings remained in place. Finally, at the back, the automaker changed the rear bumper. It featured a thick plastic trim that resembled a shield, an element that was not available for the 2019 model year. Inside, Volkswagen completely redesigned the dashboard, neatly integrating the touchscreen for the infotainment system into it. In addition, the automaker offered a choice of different trim colors that matched the car's exterior on the dash and center console. Like on the 2019 model year, the 2024 version featured a color display for the instrument cluster. Furthermore, the seats sported new colors and upholstery options but no leather. Thanks to the tall greenhouse, the 2024 T-Cross offered enough room for two adults in the back on the 60/40 split-folding bench seat. Even though the vehicle was available only with a front-wheel-drive setup, the automaker profiled the car's floor with a center tunnel for improved rigidity and protection in case of an accident. Nevertheless, the trunk space remained at the same value of 286 liters (10.1 cu-ft). New rules and regulations in terms of emissions were just around the corner, and Volkswagen tried to be up-to-date with its engines. Thus, under the T-Cross hood, it installed a choice of gasoline and turbo diesel engines ranging between 95 PS (94 HP) and 150 PS (148 HP). Both base versions fueled by diesel and gasoline sent their power to the front wheels via a five-speed manual gearbox. For the rest of the range, Volkswagen offered either a six-speed manual or a seven-speed (dual-clutch) automatic gearbox. A classic, torque-converter, six-speed automatic was the only option for the top trim level that was powered by a 1.5-liter turbocharged unit. Volkswagen fitted the MQB-A0 platform with McPherson struts at the front and semi-independent trailing arms at the rear. Even though it was not the best technological solution, it was the only one that allowed the carmaker to keep the T-Cross price down. The small-sized crossover segment was highly contested by most European mass-market automakers.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""T-Cross"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""bold stance"", ""refreshed exterior"", ""tall greenhouse""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""thicker plastic underbody shield""],    ""headlights"": [""LED daytime running lights""],    ""bumper"": [""thick plastic trim at the rear""],    ""wheel"": [""redesigned wheels"", ""black plastic moldings""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Atlas Cross Sport,"Volkswagen introduced a refreshed version of the Atlas lineup on the U.S. market in 2023 and facelifted the Cross Sport version as well. The German automaker developed and produced the Atlas lineup on top of the MQB platform shared with other vehicles made by it, such as the Golf or the Jetta. Thus, the big crossover could be easily adapted and transformed. In addition, it was available with front- or all-wheel drive systems. Last but not least, the sportier-looking Cross Sport version was made for those who didn't really need a seven-seat vehicle. But the Atlas Cross Sport shared more than its platform with the regular version. It also sported a similar-looking front fascia that featured the adaptive front-light system (AFS). This consisted of a light surrounding the headlights and a light strip that ran across the upper section of the main grille. But the main difference between the Cross Sport and its seven-seat sibling was in the profile, where the Cross Sport featured a raked-forward tailgate at the back, in a Kammback styling. Inside, the automaker installed bolstered front seats and a bench profiled for three in the back. Since it didn't have to worry about the legroom for the third row, Volkswagen provided more space for the rear-seated occupants. Also, in the 2024 model-year, the Atlas Cross Sport featured a new dashboard design that was adorned with a 12"" center touchscreen atop the center stack for the infotainment system, while the driver fronted a 12.5"" display for the instrument panel. Underneath the hood, the engine cover left the impression that there was a transversely-mounted V8. But that was only an illusion since the car was powered by a turbocharged inline-four that produced 269 hp (273 PS), which was more potent than the previous VR6 was capable. Power went to the front or in all corners of the car via an eight-speed automatic transmission.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Atlas Cross Sport"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""big crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""adaptive"", ""raked-forward"", ""spacious"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""similar-looking"", ""adaptive""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""Kammback styling""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN ID.4,"When Volkswagen introduced the ID.4, it showed just a glimpse of what the MEB platform was capable of, and the 2021 ID.4 GTX revealed more of it. Volkswagen was not the first carmaker to switch to electric power for its vehicles, but it didn't rush either. At first, the German carmaker adapted some of its well-known products such as the up! and Golf while it was researching a better platform for electric mobility. The ID.3 was a clear sign of what the newly developed MEB platform could do, and the ID.4 GTX confirmed it. Designed in-house, the ID.4 GTX showed a muscular stance with a high body shape, specific for an SUV. At the front, it showed a similar fascia as the ID4, with additional daytime running lights in the front's side scoops. The ascending beltline continued to the raked C-pillar. Alongside the newly designed bumpers included 3D LED taillights with brake lights that formed an X-sign with the horizontal light strip across the tailgate. The body color was more dominant than on regular ID.4 models. The roof and rear spoiler were black, while the roof frame was high-gloss anthracite. Inside, the vehicle's dashboard relied mostly on two displays: one as an instrument cluster and the other for the infotainment system. The minimalist design trend followed the dashboard's look, with flat and clean surfaces. The upper section of the dashboard and leatherette inserts in the doors came as a dark shade of blue. Volkswagen installed a dual-motor system for the ID.4 GTX, one for each axle. Their total output was 299 hp, and thanks to its intelligent all-wheel-drive system, it could climb a 32.5% ramp effortlessly.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""ID.4 GTX"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""muscular stance"", ""high body shape"", ""specific for an SUV"", ""minimalist design trend"", ""dominant body color""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""similar fascia as the ID4""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""additional daytime running lights"", ""3D LED taillights""],    ""bumper"": [""newly designed bumpers""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""leatherette inserts in dark blue""],    ""roof"": [""black"", ""high-gloss anthracite""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""rear spoiler in black""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Arteon Shooting Brake,"The four-door coupe Volkswagen Arteon received a facelift in 2020 and, along with that, a shooting-brake version as well. Usually, when a car receives a facelift, most of its parts are the same, and only some minor external and internal details are changed. It was not the same situation as the Arteon facelift. Volkswagen decided to give it a station-wagon shape. Since the car was a four-door coupe, the result was a shooting-brake. Like the rest of the range, the Shooting-brake featured a new pair of headlights and a new bumper design. Both versions of the facelifted version had the same length, but the extended roofline made the car look longer than the coupe. The chromed lines on the grille and the integrated LED daytime running lights from the headlights made the Arteon one of the best-looking Volkswagen on the market at its launch. Inside, the Arteon Shooting-brake made more headroom for the rear passengers due to the long roof. The 1 m (3.3 ft) legroom for the rear passengers was never a problem. The rear bench's asymmetrical split-fold extended the trunk space from 565 liters (20 cu-ft) up to 1632 liters (57.6 cu-ft). There was a new infotainment unit for the front occupants, with wireless integration for the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as well. Under the hood, the Arteon Shooting offered a choice of engines, both turbodiesel, and turbocharged gasoline units. The standard transmission was a 7-speed DSG (dual-clutch) for the entire range. Power ranged between 150 hp and 190 hp for the regular Arteon Shooting brake.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Volkswagen Arteon"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""station-wagon"",  ""overall-design"": [""shooting-brake"", ""longer"", ""chromed"", ""integrated"", ""best-looking""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""chromed""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""new"", ""integrated"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""new""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""extended"", ""long""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Polo BlueGT,"The 2013 Polo BlueGT represented the mix between a sporty little hot-hatch and an economic car, even if the price was not so low at the time of its launch. But it offered very good features. From the outside, the BlueGT version can be recognized due to its modified front bumper, which featured a larger air-scoop. From the side, the standard 17” aluminum wheels had specific design. A small roof spoiler was added on top of the tailgate. In order to achieve a better aerodynamic coefficient, the car was lowered by 15 mm (0.6”) compared to a regular Polo. Inside, there were more special features. Like the rest of the Polo range, it had the infotainment system installed on the central console and a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox (DSG). The real treatment was on the seat upholstery, which featured blue Alcantara and special stitchings. The most important feature of the BlueGT was under the hood. Volkswagen installed a 1.4-liter TSI gasoline engine that offered 140 hp. That power was not unusual for a turbocharged engine of that size. The innovation was the cylinder deactivation. If it is almost normal for most of the V8's to have such a system, it was unusual for a four-pot engine. That, combined with the intelligent gearbox, could reduce fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions. But, when pushed, the four cylinders would come back to live in a split of a second and pull the car up to 210 kph (130 mph).",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Polo BlueGT"",  ""year"": ""2013"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""economical"", ""aerodynamic"", ""modified"", ""special""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""modified""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""larger air-scoop""],    ""wheel"": [""17” aluminum"", ""specific design""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""small spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN ID.7,"Volkswagen stepped-up its pace and introduced the ID7 as a new, larger vehicle on the market based on the same MEB platform used for the ID.3, ID.4, and ID.Buzz, and the new model was set as an all-electric replacement for the well-known Passat. After investing billions in the MEB platform, the German automaker started to get its first results. All ID.-badged vehicles were very appreciated by customers. Yet, those looking for a large-sized electric sedan made by Volkswagen had to wait more for something to suit their tastes. But that eventually came in the spring of 2023. With a length that was on par with other premium mid-size sedans, the ID.7 showed a front fascia that sported the carmaker's design language for electric vehicles. The slim LED light strip that connected the angular, swept-back headlights was interrupted only by the carmaker's badge. Lower on the bumper, the automaker placed a pair of T-shaped side scoops that flanked a trapezoidal-shaped grille needed to cool the electrical system. From its profile, the fluid lines of the bodywork showed just rounded lines and curved shapes towards the fastback-looking greenhouse. And, unlike the Passat and the Arteon, it featured a big, sloped-down tailgate, which also accommodated a red LED strip between the taillights. Inside, Volkswagen installed a completely digital dashboard fronting the driver. Next to it, on the center stack, placed a 15” touchscreen for the infotainment system. At the front, occupants could enjoy the bucket seats with mild bolstering, while at the back, there was enough room for three adult-sized passengers. Since the automaker made the ID.7 on the MEB platform, it could use the single-motor or the dual-motor setup for the rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive system, respectively.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""ID.7"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""large-sized electric sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""angular"", ""swept-back"", ""fluid"", ""digital""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""trapezoidal-shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angular"", ""swept-back"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""T-shaped side scoops""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""fastback-looking""],    ""roof"": [""curved"", ""fastback-looking""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN ID. Buzz,"Volkswagen decided to return the classic, beloved Bulli in a new vehicle, but with a design inspired by its famous former predecessor, and called it the ID. Buzz. Based on the same platform as the rest of the ID. Family, the ID. Buzz tried to make a stance in the mid-size MPV and LCV segment with its electric powertrain that provided it enough power and energy to be used as a delivery van or a family-oriented leisure vehicle. At the front, the carmaker placed a sloped front fascia instead of a flat, vertical one as on the Bulli. Yet, the big, chromed VW badge and the wide V-shaped front panel resembled the older model. For the apron, the carmaker chose an unusual rhomboidal pattern. On its sides, the car unveiled the same basic principle as its predecessor, with regular, front-hinged front doors and sliding ones for the rear passengers. The back was also unusual, with very slim taillights connected via an LED strip that ran across the tailgate. The interior was a completely new story, with a display above the center stack and a TFT screen in front of the driver. But Volkswagen took a smart decision and let a passage between the front seats, with a retracted center console that divided only the space between the front passengers. The car featured a 60/40 split-folding bench wide enough for three occupants with plenty of legroom and headroom in the back. Unlike its siblings, the ID.3 and the ID.4, the ID. Buzz was available with only one drivetrain option at the launch. Volkswagen chose a 204 hp electric motor fed by a 77 kWh battery pack for propelling the vehicle. It could also store energy and deliver it either to other cars or to a home.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""ID.

VOLKSWAGEN up! GTI,"When a bunch of engineers is trying to implant the most powerful engine into the smallest car of the company, this is what you get: the up! GTI. The 2018 up! GTI was a resemblance of the original Golf GTI from 1976. It might as well be the born year for some of the engineers that worked on the project, or to some of their parents. The team took the 1liter turbocharged engine from the shelf and installed it into the up! They even mated it with a 6-speed gearbox. And, if the first Golf GTI offered 110 hp and 140 Nm (103.2 lb-ft), up! featured 115 hp and 200 Nm (147.5 lb-ft). Some little details tell the difference between a regular up! and a GTI version. First of all, there was a red stripe over the black grille. On the sides, there were double stripes over the side sills and, in the rear, the black liftgate had one red stripe on it and a larger roof-spoiler on top. The up! GTI came standard with 17” light-alloy wheels. The interior of the car had the same sporty appeal as the outside. The fabric on the seats matched the pattern on the original Golf GTI with classic tartan fabric pattern with off-white and red stripes on a black background on the center panels of the seats. The dashboard featured a ""pixels red"" design matched with the black and red interior elements. The upper door panels were in body-color.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""up!

VOLKSWAGEN Nivus,"Volkswagen designed the Nivus for the South American market and Mexico, but it planned to sell it in Eastern Europe. It was an SUV-coupe based on the same platform with the T-Cross. The Nivus hit the market in 2020, and it resembled a few models from the German car-maker stable but was a completely different vehicle. It wasn't just a cut-out from an already existing model. The European customers became very interested in that SUV-coupe and asked Volkswagen to bring it to European countries. The car's front side featured long horizontal lines over the grille to make the car look wider. With its swept-back LED headlights surrounded by the LED daytime running lights, it didn't make the impression of a budget-SUV, even if it was built on the MQB A0 platform, the base one used for the Polo. The raked A-pillars and the sloped-back roofline mimicked the shape of other successful, mid-size SUV-coupe vehicles. At least one of the two side-mounted exhausts was fake in the back, but offered a balanced look for the car. Inside, some elements resembled the Polo. It featured an integrated 10"" touch-screen on top of the center stack and a classic, analog instrument cluster. As an option, the instrument cluster was available as a digital display, connected with the infotainment unit. That was a premiere for the small-class crossover segment. Due to its short wheelbase, there was not too much room in the back, but at least the roof was sloped after the rear seats. Due to the bi-fuel system, the car was fitted with a 1.0-liter engine carried-over from the Brazilian Polo Sedan. The three-cylinder unit returned 116 hp when ran on gasoline and 128 when ran on ethanol.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Nivus"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""small-class crossover"",  ""overall-design"": [""swept-back"", ""sloped-back"", ""wide"", ""balanced"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""swept-back""],    ""grille"": [""horizontal"", ""wide""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""swept-back"", ""LED""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""short wheelbase""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""side-mounted"", ""balanced""]  }}```"
VOLKSWAGEN Vento,"The Volkswagen Vento name appeared in 1992 on the European market for the three-box Golf version. For the Indian market, the name was kept and used for the three-box Polo version on the 2010 model. The Indian small sedan market was highly contested by Japanese and European car-manufacturers. Volkswagen needed a strong contender there. It wasn't the first time when it builds a three-box Polo version. In some markets, that version was named Fox. In India though, it used the Spanish word for wind, and that was the Vento. The 2010 Vento had many similarities with the Polo, but at the front, it featured different fog-lights and air-scoops. On the side, the flared wheel-arches and sculptured profile gave the impression of a bigger car, even though its exterior dimensions are from the small class category. It featured a longer wheelbase than the Polo, and that helped to gain more rear room for the passengers. Inside, there was a two-tone dashboard, with a mix of gray and lightly brown on it. Some chromed accents were used. For the audio system, an MP3/CD player was installed. The dashboard had a simple layout with an instrument cluster that featured four dials and a small display for the on-board computer. It offered a climate control unit, instead of a simple AC. Under the hood, the Vento was offered with two 1.6-liter engines, a turbodiesel, and a gasoline unit. The standard transmission was a 5-speed manual. A 6-speed auto was offered for the gasoline version.",VOLKSWAGEN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Volkswagen Vento"",  ""year"": ""2010"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""sculptured profile"", ""flared wheel-arches"", ""longer wheelbase"", ""two-tone dashboard"", ""chromed accents""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""different fog-lights"", ""air-scoops""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLVO XC40,"Volvo introduced the XC40 in 2017 and became an instant hit in the carmaker's portfolio, even though it was offered with internal combustion engines. But that was changed over the years. In 2021, the carmaker introduced a facelift for the crossover and gave the XC40 Recharge an all-electric powertrain. From the outside, the overall shape was kept, but there were some changes here and there. For starters, the grille's place was taken by a curved panel since there was no need for a large cooling area. It was flanked by the two headlights featuring the Thor hammer design for the DRL. As expected, the car received LED lights for everything, thus reducing energy consumption while also improving lighting efficiency. At the back, the flared wheel arches and the specific Volvo taillights remained virtually unchanged. The charging port was mounted on the left rear fender. On the interior, the carmaker understood that it had to offer a premium experience and installed high-quality upholstery. But just to keep the things on the right side, the upholstery was made from sustainable materials and no real-leather skin on the seats or door cards. The center stack sported the infotainment display powered by Android, which promised a better end-user experience. For the drivetrain, Volvo installed an all-electric powertrain fed by a 68 kWh battery pack, which allowed it for a 270 miles (434 km) range.",VOLVO,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""XC40"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""curved"", ""flared"", ""premium"", ""sustainable"", ""efficient""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""curved""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""Thor hammer design""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""flared""],    ""doors"": [""high-quality"", ""sustainable""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLVO XC90,"The refreshed XC90 released in 2019 is a large SUV, a 7-seater perfectly designed for large families. It was spacious, luxurious, simple and sophisticated at the same time. The exterior design hadn’t changed in comparison to the previous version at it didn’t need to, as it was already well thought and definitely beautiful. The Volvo’s attention to details can be recognized in 2019 as well, as even the key was all wrapped in Nappa leather. The interior was very inviting, with a minimalistic design. Depending on the buyer’s taste, the interior trims could be made of wood, aluminum or carbon fiber. All seats are covered in Nappa leather that came in 3 color options. We already said that it is a spacious car and usually an ideal vehicle for large families. The leg and head room in the 2nd seats row ensures a comfortable ride, however, the 3rd seats row not that much. The middle seat in the 2nd row is foldable, to ease the access to the 3rd row. The cargo area is a bit cramped with all the seats unfolded, however, the XC90 offers a 86 cubic feet of room with the seats folded. The on board technology is worth mentioning as well, the car being equipped with a 12.3-inch color instrument cluster which allows a good view over the necessary driving information. Volvo is already known for the safety offered by their vehicles and the XC90 was no exception. It was equipped with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist and pilot assist. The pilot assist offers autonomous driving but also requires the driver to be 100% attentive.

VOLVO S90,"The Swedish company introduced a newly refreshed S90 at the beginning of 2020. The main feature introduced by Volvo's flagship vehicle is a mild-hybrid system, which is now available on every engine version. From the outside, the S90 facelift has minor upgrades, visible on the front and rear bumpers and fog lights. Maybe some of the most important exterior upgrades are the taillights, with a new LED signature. On the inside, the Volvo S90 was known for its special audio system signed by Bower&Wilkins, which replicates the sound experience from the Gothenborg concert hall. Also, for better occupant comfort, Volvo installed a new air-cleaner system, with a special PM 2.5 particle sensor, to decrease the amount of particles absorbed inside the cabin. For the engine compartment, Volvo has installed the same 2.0 liter turbo engine with gasoline as before, but offered with different power levels. The base model is called the T6, has 316 hp and and 295 lb-ft (400 Nm) of torque. Also, there is a plug-in hybrid version called the T8, which offers a total power output of 392hp and 640 Nm (472 lb-ft) of torque. For the transmission, the S90 is equipped with an 8-speed automatic transmission for the entire range.

VOLVO V90 Cross Country,"The launch of the 2020 S90/V90 couldn't be completed without the 2020 V90 Cross Country variant. It is designed to be used as a luxury vehicle, a people carrier and, in some situations, a station wagon that can climb to a remote lodge on top of a hill, on a twisty, bumpy road. Despite having the same technical platform as the S/V90, the Cross Country version has only traditional internal-combustion engines and no plug-in hybrid was announced, but the existing versions are mild-hybrid. The Volvo V90 Cross Country represents the first electrified variant in the history of the Cross Country range. There are two gasoline versions and two diesel engines ones. All of them are 4-cylinders and turbocharged. The gasoline versions develop 250hp and 310hp, respectively, while the turbodiesel variants offer 190hp and 235 hp, respectively. Only the low-power diesel is available with a 6-speed manual while the others are equipped with an 8-speed automatic. All-wheel-drive is standard on all Cross Country models. For the interior, the V90 Cross Country offers a Bowers and Wilkins sound system tuned after the Gothenburg concert hall. For the rear passengers, Volvo replaced the 12v sockets with USB-C plugs. The cargo area remained the same as for the 2016 version with 560 (19.8 cu.-ft) liters with the rear seats up and up to 1526 liters (53.9 cu.-ft) with the rear seats folded.",VOLVO,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""V90 Cross Country"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": ""Luxury, people carrier, station wagon"",  ""overall-design"": [""Luxury"", ""Versatile"", ""Elegant"", ""Rugged""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""Sleek""],    ""grille"": [""Distinctive""],    ""hood"": [""Sculpted""],    ""headlights"": [""Sleek"", ""Modern""],    ""bumper"": [""Rugged""],    ""wheel"": [""All-terrain""],    ""doors"": [""Streamlined""],    ""roof"": [""Aerodynamic""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLVO V90,"In 2020 Volvo refreshed its upper class lineup and, besides the S90 and V90 Cross Country, the V90 was refreshed also. Even if it wasn't really necessary The most striking detail changed on the V90 is the design of the new taillights. It now includes a LED signature for the sequential turn-light indicator. Other exterior changes include new light-alloy wheel designs and new colors for the bodywork. Inside, Volvo installed two USB-C sockets for the rear seats, instead of the 12v outlets. Maybe this is a downside since most people are still using regular 12v type plugs. For the front occupants there is an option for a wireless charger for phones. The SPA (Scalable Product Architecture) used for the V90 now allows the use of a Bowers & Wilkins audio system, which means that the vehicle will be like a concert hall on wheels. The same platform is responsible for the introduction of the mild-hybrid system with a 48v architecture. Elsewhere in its model range, Volvo Cars is significantly expanding the number of its 48 volt mild-hybrid powertrain options, making these engine options available on every single Volvo model. For the engine range, Volvo installed 4-cylinder diesel or gasoline units, all turbocharged. For diesel, the power ranges between 150 hp and 235 hp, while the gasoline engines offers between 190 hp and 310 hp. The top of the range is the plug-in hybrid model T8, which offers a total output of 390 hp and 640 Nm (472 lb-ft).",VOLVO,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""V90"",  ""year"": ""2020"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""refreshed"", ""striking"", ""new colors"", ""light-alloy wheel designs""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""mild-hybrid""]  }}```"
VOLVO S60,"The Volvo S60 is as global as a vehicle could be. The brand was from Sweden. Its owners were from China and the assembly plant in the U.S. And it was built for the Premium market. A minimalist design both on the outside and on the inside, a clear brand image with its horizontal T-DRL in the headlights (T was from the Nordic god Thor) and only state-of-the-art engines and features. The outside look is somehow similar to a shrunken S80 with which it shares the same SPA (Scalable Product Architecture). The rear shoulders over the fenders were typical for a Volvo. But it was more than a shorter S80. On the front, the bumper featured big air-scoops in front of the wheels, to cool the brakes. It was a sign of performance. And for most versions, it was true. The interior was a carry-over from the V60. Usually, the station-wagon is launched after the sedan. In this case, the sedan was launched later. On the center console, there was a big infotainment unit touch-screen. The instrument cluster was another TFT display, which could have been configured by the driver to show the information needed, where it was needed. But the biggest philosophy change was under the hood, where the Volvo left all the diesel engines out. Under the hood, there were only turbocharged gasoline engines and, for the top-of-the-range T8, a hybrid system with electric motors.",VOLVO,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Volvo S60"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""global"", ""minimalist"", ""premium"", ""shrunken"", ""performance""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""clear""],    ""grille"": [""horizontal"", ""minimalist""],    ""hood"": [""shrunken""],    ""headlights"": [""T-DRL"", ""horizontal""],    ""bumper"": [""big air-scoops"", ""performance""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLVO V60,"Volvo aimed high with the 2018 V60 as a family-friendly vehicle that placed its bets on interior room, safety, and ecology without giving up the performances. After the Ford era, the Swedish carmaker convinced its new owner, Geely Holding Group, to finance them for developing premium vehicles. The result was the Volvo SPA platform, which the carmaker used for the second generation of the XC60 and the S90. In 2018, the V60 showed up with a radical change in design over its predecessor. While the first generation of the V60 looked like a shooting-brake with four doors, the second generation returned to a more formal station wagon shape. The car's exterior featured a new front fascia designed in the Swedish minimalist way. Its clean lines and flat surfaces resembled some IKEA pieces of furniture but sturdier. The profile revealed sculptured doors, body panels, and an ascending beltline towards the car's back raised above the enlarged rear fenders. A set of vertically mounted taillights flanked its tilted-forward tailgate in an already typical Volvo design. Inside, the V60 provided room for five adults. At the front, Volvo installed two bucket seats separated by a square-looking center console. Unlike its predecessor, the dashboard didn't sport the floating center stack. A big, 12.3"", portrait-type touch screen occupied the center stack flanked by a pair of vertical vents. The Sensus infotainment system was unusual for a car segment dominated by floating screens placed in a portrait mode above the center stack. On the rear 40/20/40 split-folding bench, it was room enough for three adults. The V60 provided 529 liters (18.7 cu-ft) of trunk space, expandable to 1,441 liters (50.9 cu-ft), with the rear seats folded down. Under the hood, Volvo installed a choice of four-cylinder engines, turbocharged, both gasoline, and diesel. On top of that, the carmaker added two hybrid versions.",VOLVO,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""V60"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""station wagon"",  ""overall-design"": [""minimalist"", ""sculptured"", ""formal"", ""sturdy"", ""clean""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""new front fascia"", ""Swedish minimalist design""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""sculptured"", ""formal"", ""ascending beltline""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLVO V60 Polestar,"The Polestar was for Volvo like AMG for Mercedes-Benz or M for BMW. It was their division of mad engineers that tuned and tricked Volvo vehicles. While it was still under Ford's ownership, Volvo had to do safe, soccer-mom, eco-friendly vehicles. They were not allowed to brag about their victorious racing past. Volvo could only show their automatic braking systems, the gazillion airbags, and its Swedish steel superiority. Well, Geely changed all that philosophy after Volvo passed through some hands and landed on the Chinese giant portfolio. The new owner tried to make Volvo fans smile again, and the Polestar versions were just a way to do that. From the outside, the V60 Polestar sported a way more aggressive stance than its regular versions. The design team added a new lip-spoiler, a roof spoiler, and a diffuser under the rear bumper for starters. A pair of big exhaust was far from any ecological statement but quite convincing for anyone who wants to go faster. To complete the image of the bad guy of the family, Volvo installed 20"" light-alloy wheels. The Polestar version was similar to its V60 siblings, but it featured a different trim on the center console, which featured carbon-fiber accents. Its bucket-seats with high bolstering had blue stitching, the official color of the Polestar. The 2017 version sported a 2.0-liter inline-four engine.  A turbocharger and a supercharger helped it obtain 367 hp, which went to an 8-speed automatic transmission that sent the power to an electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system biased to the rear axle.",VOLVO,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Volvo V60 Polestar"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""mid-size"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""sporty"", ""performance-oriented""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""aggressive""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""diffuser"", ""aggressive""],    ""wheel"": [""20-inch"", ""light-alloy""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""spoiler"", ""aggressive""],    ""diffusor"": [""under rear bumper""],    ""spoiler"": [""lip-spoiler"", ""roof spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": [""big"", ""sporty""]  }}```"
VOLVO V60 Cross Country,"Just like the V60, upon which it is based, and the S60 sedan, the second generation of the Volvo V60 Cross Country is based on Volvo's Scalable Product Architecture (SPA) platform, which is used on every modern model developed after Geely took over the brand. Essentially a V60 station wagon with increased ride height and standard all-wheel-drive, the V60 Cross Country wears a nameplate that is shared with other Volvos is a bit of a legend in its own right. Based on a brand new platform, the second generation of the model is larger in almost every respect, while its design closely follows the same lines introduced by its bigger brothers in the 90 Series, but with an added dose of ruggedness from the carmaker's SUVs. Apart from the ride height, which has been increased by 60 mm compared to the regular V60, the most underlying Cross Country features are the black plastic additions to the wheel arches and the lower parts of the front and rear bumpers, which are bespoke to the model. Volvo is mostly proud of the so-called “Thor's Hammer” LED headlamp design, all-new grille and the evolved Volvo Iron Mark badge, but those elements are shared with the regular V60 all other SPA-based modern Volvos. The new V60 Cross Country is powered exclusively by four-cylinder engines, which deliver between 190 horsepower to 250 horsepower and can be mated either to an Aisin 8-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual gearbox. As expected, an all-wheel-drive system in standard on all Cross Country models, including the V60.",VOLVO,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""V60 Cross Country"",  ""year"": ""second generation"",  ""size"": ""larger"",  ""overall-design"": [""rugged"", ""modern"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""all-new"", ""evolved""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""Thor's Hammer""],    ""bumper"": [""black plastic additions"", ""bespoke""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLVO S60 Polestar,"After Volvo broke the chains with Ford, it started to dream better and evolve to a different level. It was more focused on safety and ecological cars. But the Polestar versions were its spoiled offsprings. When you hear the expression “bring everything you got,” you might think of a drama or action movie. For Volvo, that was what the new management told the motorsports department. And the engineers from there brought all they got and put it into one car: the S60 Polestar. It was the car that Volvo could do it a long time ago, but they were assigned to stick with the safety leader badge, not the sport one. But Polestar was something else. It was a small racing team acquired by Volvo in 2015, and the S60 Polestar was their first product under the roof of the Swedish carmaker. For starters, the designers gave more stance to the midsize Volvo sedan by adding a new lip-spoiler, a trunk spoiler, and a diffuser under the rear bumper. A pair of big exhaust was far from any ecological statement but quite convincing for anyone who wants to go faster. To complete the image of the bad guy of the family, Volvo installed 20” light-alloy wheels.

VOLVO XC60,"Launched at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show, the XC60 was the second generation for the premium SUV built by Volvo. It was a very important model for the Swedish brand. The XC60 accounted for around 30 percent of the Volvo sales worldwide. It was important for introducing new safety features and since the compact SUV market was so demanding, Volvo didn't want to cut any corners to build a better car. They rounded them. While the first generation was based mostly on the former Ford Mondeo platform, the second generation was based on a new Volvo SPA platform (Scalable Platform Architecture) used by other Volvo models as well. The design language kept the “Thor's hammer” daytime running lights inside the headlights and the big chromed grille. But the car didn't look like a station-wagon on stilts, but its rear design was inspired mostly by the hatchback segment. Inside, Volvo insisted to put as many recycled materials as possible. The wood grain on the dash and door panels, the cloth, or the man-made leather upholstery were of top quality, with premium fits and finishes. For the drivetrain, the XC60 was offered with front or all-wheel-drive systems. It was offered with diesel, gasoline, hybrids, and plug-in hybrid versions. The safety features covered most of the areas, including automatic lane-keep assist, adaptive cruise control, and blind-spot monitor.

VOLVO EX90,"Volvo introduced its full-electric flagship SUV EX90 in late 2022, offering an alternative to the already-known Tesla Model X. The Swedish automaker was under Geely's umbrella when it started reinventing itself after a few long and painful years spent in the same boat with Ford. Then, with Chinese funding and Volvo's engineering, things started to move in a better direction. Thus, after a few electrified models, the automaker launched a new brand, Polestar, and then new electric models, such as the EX90. Sporting a clean front fascia design, the SUV looked different than other car manufacturers. There was no grille but a plastic panel crossed by Volvo's logo and its traditional diagonal line. The LED headlights resembled the ""Thor hammer"" styling, continued on the lower bumper's sides by six light blocks. From its profile, the SUV resembled the XC 90, while its sculptured doors had similar creases on the bottom of the doors as the XC 40. Finally, at the back, the angular styling used for the taillights was also very Swedish. In addition, the LED lights from the D-pillars matched the pattern of the front DRLs. Inside, a luxurious yet clean design surrounded the occupants with a relaxed atmosphere. There were around 50 kilograms (110 lbs) of recycled materials inside. The design team installed a small screen in front of the driver for the instrument panel, accompanied by a massive 14.5"" portrait-type touchscreen on the center stack. It used the floating design theme but didn't look like it was placed there by accident. For the front occupants, Volvo installed its unique-designed seats with active headrests. At the same time, three passengers could share the middle row. Finally, two more extra seats were added in the trunk area. A 380 kW (510 HP) twin-motor all-wheel drive system was installed under the car's skin fed by a 111kWh battery pack.",VOLVO,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""EX90"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""Full-electric flagship SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""Clean"", ""Luxurious"", ""Angular"", ""Sculptured"", ""Swedish""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""Clean"", ""Plastic"", ""Logo-centered""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""Thor hammer styling""],    ""bumper"": [""Angular"", ""Six light blocks""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""Sculptured"", ""Creases""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLVO C40,"At the beginning of 2022, Volvo introduced a sportier-looking version of the XC40 Recharge on the market and named it C40 Recharge. While the XC40 was a regular crossover with an almost vertical tailgate, the C40 was more of a four-door coupe crossover. But both vehicles shared the same underpinnings. The C40 has a specific shape from the outside, but some parts were shared with its XC40 Recharge sibling. Since there was no need for a larger cooling area, the all-electric C40 Recharge received a curved panel instead of a regular grille. In addition, Volvo installed a choice of light-alloy wheels up to 20"" in size. At the front, the car shared the same look as the XC40, but it featured a sloped-down roofline with a tailgate at the back. The specific design of the taillights was emphasized by the rear fenders' shape, with enlarged areas that created the known ""Volvo shoulders."" The interior looked similar to the one from the XC40 Recharge. Atop the center stack, the carmaker placed an Android-powered infotainment unit. In addition, Volvo installed a rather tall center console between the front seats, even though it didn't need any room for a gearbox since it didn't feature one. The C40 Recharge offered room for two adult passengers at the back, although the headroom was not as adequate as in the XC40. Volvo introduced the C40 Recharge with the 402 hp (408 PS) dual electric motor setup that rocketed the EV from 0 to 62 mph (0-100 kph) in less than five seconds.",VOLVO,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""C40 Recharge"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""elegant""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""curved""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""shared look with XC40""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [""light-alloy"", ""up to 20\""""],    ""doors"": [""four-door coupe style""],    ""roof"": [""sloped-down""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""electric""]  }}```"
VOLVO EX30,"Volvo's smallest SUV, the EX30, combines world-renowned safety with high practicability and reduced dimensions, making the vehicle useful for a broader range of customers. It has three powertrain versions to suit different needs for complete versatility. The first version, with a single electric motor, is made to be used in urban traffic and for short distances, having the lowest range of the three interpretations offered by Volvo. On the other hand, this version is the most cost-effective one and represents a more affordable approach to the quality that defines Volvo as an automaker. For longer trips, a Single Motor Extended Range variant encapsulates a bigger battery that can provide up to 300 miles of range from a single charge. This one may be a good match for drivers who tend to have ""range anxiety."" For speed enthusiasts, Volvo offers a third variant of the EX30, Twin Motor Performance, with two electric motors, as the name suggests. It is Volvo's fastest-accelerating car at the time of its presentation, having a 0 to 62 mph time of only 3.6 seconds. Although it can have impressive dynamic performances thanks to its power output of 422 hp, the vehicle also has the lowest carbon footprint amongst all the Volvos ever produced. The car also has optional fast charging that can see the battery charge from 10 to 80 percent in no more than 25 minutes. For more versatility, the Swedish carmaker offers an EX30 Cross Country version in the form of a car with increased ground clearance, skid plates mounted on every part of the vehicle, optional 19-inch black wheels, and Cross Country branding that is highlighted by a Swedish flag mounted on the hood. These features help keep Volvo's cross-country tradition alive and provide the EX30 with a total off-road makeover. The EX30 prioritizes safety, as one would anticipate from a Volvo, and has many active and passive safety features meant to create a safe environment for the passengers and the other traffic participants. One notable safety feature is its standard inclusion of a dedicated system to prevent ""dooring"" incidents involving bicycles. This feature notifies the passengers when they are about to open a door in the path of a cyclist, scooter rider, or runner, ensuring their safety and avoiding unpleasant situations and eventual injuries. Also, for more functionality, the car comes equipped with Park Pilot Assist, a function that reduces the risk of collisions when trying to squeeze the car into tiny spaces across the city. Volvo EX30 represents one of the most versatile SUVs due to its small size and competitive characteristics, and it can be a suitable car for both daily driving and off-roading without any significant modifications.",VOLVO,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""EX30"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""practical"", ""versatile"", ""safe"", ""efficient"", ""dynamic""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""small"", ""sleek""],    ""headlights"": [""modern""],    ""bumper"": [""functional""],    ""wheel"": [""optional 19-inch black""],    ""doors"": [""equipped with Park Pilot Assist""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
VOLVO EM90,"Volvo introduced its first modern MPV in late 2023 for the 2024 model year and tried to convince customers that minivans were worthy thanks to their vast interiors and increased level of comfort. As part of the Geely Chinese industrial giant, Volvo had access to new platforms and technologies that allowed the Swedish automaker to dodge the bullet of bankruptcy and become another dormant automaker. In 2022, the Chinese brand Zeekr introduced the 009 minivan as a luxurious people carrier. Zeekr, as part of the same Geely company, shared its MPV underpinnings with Volvo, who adapted the vehicle to suit its brand image. But even if it was a badge-engineered product, the EM90 was different in many aspects, raising the bar in terms of luxury and image. Volvo’s first people carrier vehicle was the PV445 Duett during the ‘50s, followed by the P210 Duett in the ‘60s. After that, the Swedish automaker focused on sedans and station wagons more than on anything else, so the EM90s was the first minivan made by Volvo in more than half a century. Its front fascia features a panel crossed by small illuminated elements and the automaker’s backlit badge. On its upper sides, the automaker installed its signature design element, Thor hammer, for the daytime running lights, and underneath them, it placed the main LED headlights. The big front fascia continued downward with an apron that sported a trapezoidal-shaped air intake that cooled the electronic components behind it and a pair of side scoops. From its profile, the EM90 boasted a silhouette with a short front end followed by a steep panoramic windshield. The double A-pillars reduced the blind spots for the driver and allowed the automaker to install front-hinged front doors. Volvo installed sliding doors for the rear passengers, while at the back, the car featured a vertical tailgate adorned by a small roof spoiler that incorporated the third braking light. Inside, the EM90 was a true luxury home with tall-mounted seats for the front passengers and a wide center console that separated them where Volvo installed the drive selector and a storage compartment. The Swedish automaker created a minimalist design in the cabin, so the dashboard was uncluttered by buttons and switches. It moved most of the controls on the 14.5” infotainment screen that sat on top of the dashboard’s center. Fronting the driver was the main instrument panel shown on a display. For the second-row seated passengers, the car manufacturer created two comfortable reclining and sliding armchairs with an incorporated folding table into their armrests. Access to the third row of seats was rather difficult since the second row had to be slid forward. Under its skin, at the launch, the EM90 featured a 200 kW (268 hp) electric motor that drove the rear wheels. It was fed by a 116 kWh battery pack that ensured a range of up to 738 km (459 miles) under CLTC (Chinese standards).",VOLVO,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""EM90"",  ""year"": ""2024"",  ""size"": ""MPV"",  ""overall-design"": [""luxurious"", ""modern"", ""minimalist"", ""sleek"", ""spacious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""panoramic""],    ""grille"": [""trapezoidal-shaped""],    ""hood"": [""short""],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""illuminated""],    ""bumper"": [""apron"", ""trapezoidal-shaped""],    ""wheel"": [""rear wheels""],    ""doors"": [""front-hinged"", ""sliding""],    ""roof"": [""small roof spoiler""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""small roof spoiler""],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
WIESMANN GT MF5,"Inspired by older British cars, the Wiesmann brothers produced cars for petrolheads with deep pockets and a real need for speed attitude backed up by driving skills. The German car manufacturer was established by two brothers: one engineer and one businessman. They started in 1993 when their first roadster left the workshop. Later on, the small company launched other products in convertible and coupe shapes. But there was one thing that remained constant: the powertrain carried over from BMW, and the MF5 was the most powerful version produced by the small, Dulmen-based enterprise. Designed as a sporty British coupe from the '60s, the MF5 was packed with modern technologies. Its rounded shapes of the bodywork and ample front wheel fenders were part of the retro-style design. The round headlights with clear lenses were far better than the '60s best headlights. As for the bumper, well, there was none. The crash-protective elements were well hidden behind the front fascia. Wiesmann believed that a true, hard-core sportscar had to feature a minimalist design, and that's how it did it. In the back, the carmaker installed four LED taillights grouped by two. An impressive wing adorned the trunk lid, and it wasn't there just for the look. The interior was manually crafted, and there was even an iPhone connection cable in the armrest. There was only a small cluster in front of the driver, where the car showed the gear and a few lights. The speedometer and other gauges found their place on the center stack, tilted toward the steering wheel. Under the hood, Wiesmann installed a twin-turbo V-8 engine from BMW. It produced 555 hp, which transformed the beautiful and elegant coupe into a rocket since its weight was just 3,241 lbs (1,470 kg).",WIESMANN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""MF5"",  ""year"": ""1993"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""sporty"", ""retro-style"", ""elegant"", ""minimalist"", ""modern""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""rounded""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""rounded""],    ""headlights"": [""round"", ""clear-lensed""],    ""bumper"": [""minimalist""],    ""wheel"": [""front fenders""],    ""doors"": [""manually crafted""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""impressive""],    ""exhaust"": [""twin-turbo""]  }}```"
WIESMANN GT MF4,"After a few years of development, Wiesmann transformed the MF3 roadster into a capable two-door sportscar powered by a BMW-sourced V8, and the result was spectacular. Martin and Friedheim Wiesmann brothers created something unusual but pleasant for those who asked for a custom-looking car but could still find parts for it. They put some British car design cues into a blender and mixed them with modern technologies, and the result was not just stunning but also thrilling. From the outside, the heart-shaped grille that resembled the one from a Jaguar XK120, the doors from an E-Type, and the roofline from an Austin Healey (or, maybe, Morgan Aeromax) created a mix of beautiful cues. In addition, the four headlights mimicked machine guns from a WWII aircraft. There was no visible bumper on either side of the vehicle since that was neatly concealed underneath the bodywork. The sloped rear end also sported the same number of round lamps, plus a set of two other fog lights flanked the twin exhaust system. Inside, the cabin was tiny, just wide enough for two people. But it didn't lack luxurious amenities such as quilted Alcantara on the sports seats with high-back and leather outer sides. Fronting the driver was just a small instrument cluster with a few displays, while the main dials were placed on the center stack. A special storage area between the seats hosted a phone or MP3 player connector, plus the buttons for the heated seats and the adjustments for the electric door mirrors. Under the hood, the MF4 featured a 4.4-liter V8 that provided 408 hp (408 PS), 46 hp more than the previous MF4 introduced in 2008.",WIESMANN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Wiesmann MF4"",  ""year"": ""2009"",  ""size"": ""tiny"",  ""overall-design"": [""custom-looking"", ""mix of beautiful cues"", ""stunning"", ""thrilling"", ""luxurious""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped""],    ""grille"": [""heart-shaped"", ""resembling Jaguar XK120""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""four"", ""mimicking machine guns""],    ""bumper"": [""concealed underneath the bodywork""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""from an E-Type""],    ""roof"": [""resembling Austin Healey or Morgan Aeromax""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""twin""]  }}```"
WIESMANN MF4 Roadster,"Wiesmann introduced the MF4 Roadster in 2010 at the Geneva Motor Show, and it proved to be one of the best modern-classic vehicles on the market. While some people are taking old cars and install new drivetrains inside, Wiesmann designed the car from the ground up. With a new chassis and modern suspension, it was much easier to make the car corners faster than a re-engineered one. It also used modern alloys and technologies for the chassis and bodywork. The MF4 Roadster might have resembled a British roadster. Its grille revived memories about a Jaguar or, maybe, an Alfa Romeo. Its headlights featured four rounded lamps used for high and low beams and the turn-signals. From its sides, the Coca-Cola bottle design showed its lowest point on the door, with the handles at the same level as the front and reared upper lamps. In the back, its three-lamp design, plus the fog-light and the reversing lamp flanking the license plate, emphasized the car's classic look. Like all the Wiesmanns before, the MF4 Roadster was hand-built piece by piece. Thus, there is no wonder that it's interior looked like custom-made luxurious furniture. Apart from the infotainment's screen and the instrument panel, everything else was upholstered in leather. The dashboard, the center stack, and the center console sported the same expensive material. With its dials and gauges installed in the middle of the panel and the warning-lights panel placed in front of the driver, Wiesmann managed to blend the old and the new in a luxurious and functional blend. Under the hood, the German car manufacturer installed a 4.4-liter V-8 supplied by BMW. It was paired to a standard six-speed automatic gearbox and sent all the power to the rear wheels.",WIESMANN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""MF4 Roadster"",  ""year"": ""2010"",  ""size"": """",  ""overall-design"": [""modern-classic"", ""luxurious"", ""functional"", ""hand-built"", ""British roadster""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""resembles British roadster"", ""resembles Jaguar or Alfa Romeo""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""four rounded lamps"", ""classic look""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""Coca-Cola bottle design"", ""handles at same level as lamps""],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": [""classic look""]  }}```"
WIESMANN MF5 Roadster,"Wiesmann produced vehicles for those with deep pockets who could appreciate a bespoke sports car built on their taste, and then the German carmaker offered it as a roadster. When a big carmaker wants to build a special roadster, the engineering team will have an army of accountants behind them who will scream that they will not approve an unusual project. But there are a few car manufacturers who could do that. Wiesmann was one of them. Dressed like an old British roadster, the MF5 was packed with new technologies. The rounded shapes of the bodywork and ample front wheel fenders are part of the retro-style design. Its round headlights with clear lenses are far better than the '60s best headlights. As for the bumper, well, there is none of that. The crash-protective elements are well hidden behind the front fascia. The purity of a roadster consisted of a minimalist design, and Wiesmann designers were good at that. In the back, behind the exposed retractable roof-top, the carmaker installed six LED taillights grouped by three, flanking the trunk. Also, no bumper here, but the protection element could have been seen behind the license plate support, above the two exhausts. The interior was manually crafted, and there was even an iPhone connection cable in the armrest. There was only a small cluster in front of the driver, where the car showed the gear and a few lights. The speedometer and other gauges found their place on the center stack, tilted toward the steering wheel. Under the hood, Wiesmann installed a twin-turbo V-8 engine from BMW.

WIESMANN GT MF4-CS,"Wiesmann was on the brink of extinction when it introduced the GT MF4-CS at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show in March, and some people didn't believe that the German car manufacturer would be able to produce the car. And yet, it did. When it was unveiled, the car manufacturer was not in good financial shape. The world financial crisis left deep marks on Wiesmann's bank accounts, and the owners struggled to survive and keep the brand alive. Moreover, they came up with a bold idea: to create a celebration model, and that was the GT MF4-CS, where the last letters came from Club Sport. Because that's what the sports car was all about: a race car with number plates on it. With its fiberglass bodywork and its flowing lines, the CS version was very similar to its standard MF4 model. Yet, the rear carbon fiber wing differentiated it enough to not be mistaken with its less hard-core version. The specific heart-shaped grille that took its inspiration from older Jaguar sports cars and the two-lamps headlights system was still there. Behind the front panel, the carmaker added the protective bumper but hid it to not spoil the car's look. From its profile, the CS version showed its new 19"" light-alloy wheels with wider seats at the back. The interior was nowhere as luxurious as in its GT MF4 sibling. It lacked an air-conditioning unit and an infotainment system. Wiesmann considered that a track car doesn't need that. Moreover, it filled the center stack with two big dials and added some more gauges atop them. The sports seats featured race harnesses to keep their occupants in place during a track session. Like its siblings, the CS version featured a 4.0-liter V8 powerplant carried over from BMW. The naturally aspirated engine sent its power to the rear wheels via a seven-speed automatic gearbox via a limited-slip differential.",WIESMANN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""GT MF4-CS"",  ""year"": ""2013"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""bold"", ""celebration"", ""race-inspired"", ""flowing"", ""aggressive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""flowing""],    ""grille"": [""heart-shaped"", ""inspired"", ""Jaguar""],    ""hood"": [""fiberglass""],    ""headlights"": [""two-lamps""],    ""bumper"": [""protective"", ""hidden""],    ""wheel"": [""19-inch"", ""light-alloy"", ""wider""],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""carbon fiber""],    ""exhaust"": [""rear""]  }}```"
WIESMANN MF4-S Roadster,"Derived from its sporty MF4-S Coupe, the 2010 Roadster version aimed at those who wanted an open-top vehicle with a retro-inspired design but still up to date in terms of technology. When most cars were built on top of chassis, the open-top versions were lighter. Later on, when the automakers widely introduced unibody construction for vehicles, convertibles became heavier. Thus, most performance cars with a hard roof were faster than their open-top siblings. But that didn't stop car enthusiasts from looking for roadsters, which were not as fast but more pleasant to drive. That's why the Wiesmann brothers created the MF4-S Roadster; for those who cared more about pleasure and less about lap times. In addition, the car was no slouch. Featuring the same signature design of the Wiesmann vehicles, the MF4-S Roadster sported the same heart-shaped grille at the front and no visible bumper. That was concealed behind the body panels. The car's twin-headlamp design was unique on the market and distinguished this brand's car from any other car manufacturer. Behind the long and curved hood, the automaker installed thick A-pillars that supported the windshield. There was no B-post or safety arch to disturb the car's profile. When retracted, the canvas roof was visible behind the seats, as it happened with old roadsters. Since it was a car built for pleasure, it boasted a leather-wrapped interior. Apart from the floor, everything was covered with that. The instrument panel placed in front of the driver showed just a few data on an LED. The rest of the information, such as speed or revs, was shown on the dials mounted on the center stack. Like its coupe-shaped sibling, the MF4-S Roadster was powered by a 4.0-liter V8 carried over from BMW. It was paired with either a six-speed manual or a seven-speed automatic.",WIESMANN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""MF4-S Roadster"",  ""year"": ""2010"",  ""size"": ""compact"",  ""overall-design"": [""retro-inspired"", ""sporty"", ""pleasure-focused"", ""unique"", ""up-to-date""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""thick"", ""curved""],    ""grille"": [""heart-shaped""],    ""hood"": [""long"", ""curved""],    ""headlights"": [""twin"", ""unique""],    ""bumper"": [""concealed""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""canvas"", ""retracted""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
WIESMANN GT MF4-S,"There are three key ingredients for a sports car: low weight, perfect weight distribution, and more power, and the Wiesmann GT MF4-S had them all. Derived from the standard MF4 Coupe, the Wiesmann GT MF4-S was the lighter and faster version of its luxurious brother. While some customers were happy with their standard vehicles, others asked the car manufacturer to build them a sportier version, and thus the -S version appeared. There were some minor exterior changes between the two versions. In the GT MF4-S, the front spoiler featured a mesh-grille on the apron and a lip underneath. Its dual Xenon-headlights fitted as standard showed a better view during night driving. At the back, the carmaker changed the taillights and included the reversing lights in the lower lamp, while the fog-lights were moved lower. A speed-dependable rear wing found its place under the windscreen. Inside, the customization program was extensive and allowed the owner to chose colors and a combination of features. What it couldn't change was the automatic transmission. The shift-buttons on the steering wheel were also fitted as standards. Wiesmann installed four gauges on the center stack, two larger dials for the tachometer and speedometer, and a clock. Under the hood, the carmaker dropped a BMW M3 V-8 engine that provided 420 hp. It was paired as standard to a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox. Thanks to the lightened vehicle, it offered thrilling experiences for those who asked for more from the retro-modern German coupe.",WIESMANN,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Wiesmann GT MF4-S"",  ""year"": """",  ""size"": ""lightweight"",  ""overall-design"": [""retro-modern"", ""luxurious"", ""sporty""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""speed-dependable""],    ""grille"": [""mesh""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""dual Xenon""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""rear""],    ""exhaust"": [""lower""]  }}```"
Xpeng G3,"The Chinese automaker XPeng unveiled the facelifted version of the G3 electric SUV in 2021, aligning the vehicle's look with the rest of the carmaker's products. Despite its short history on the market, the carmaker pushed hard to launch new products. It didn't start low, and thanks to massive investments, it was able to show a few models in less than a decade of existence. One of the products was the all-electric SUV G3, which was introduced in 2018 and received an update just three years later. With a front fascia that featured a closed panel instead of a grille, already a design signature for electric vehicles, the G3i sported angular-shaped headlights integrated into the bumper. Above them, the automaker installed slim horizontal daytime running lights. Even though it was an electric vehicle, it still needed some cooling area, and that was placed in the apron behind a trapezoidal-shaped grille. From its profile, the compact-sized crossover featured a sloped-down greenhouse that ended into a racked-forward tailgate at the back. The interior boasted high-bolstered front seats and a split-folding benchseat in the rear. On the dashboard, the automaker placed a large, portrait-mode touchscreen as a center stack and a second smaller display inside the instrument cluster. One particular feature of the vehicle was the windscreen, which was extended on the roof above the front occupants. While the electric motor was nothing to write home about it, the car's AI-based system allowed the vehicle to perform simple autonomous tasks such as parking. It could do that even if no one was onboard to steer the wheel.",Xpeng,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""G3"",  ""year"": ""2021"",  ""size"": ""compact-sized"",  ""overall-design"": [""angular-shaped headlights"", ""sloped-down greenhouse"", ""racked-forward tailgate"", ""portrait-mode touchscreen"", ""extended windscreen""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""extended on the roof""],    ""grille"": [""closed panel"", ""trapezoidal-shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""angular-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [""integrated headlights"", ""cooling area""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""racked-forward""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
Xpeng P5,"XPeng introduced its third model, the P5, in 2021, attacking the mid-size sedan segment with an EV that promised to be a contender against vehicles such as the Tesla Model 3. Even though the Chinese automaker was new on the market, it forged ahead with new products. It didn't want to wait to see if the direction was good. As a result, even though the world pandemic was not over yet, Xpeng started production for the P5. While the carmaker didn't yet have a design signature for its lineup, it tried to create one and installed an LED strip across the front fascia, from side to side. Some might say that they saw that design somewhere else and, somehow, they can't be blamed. The angular, angry-looking headlights featured LED high and low beams, and the lower bumper, which also incorporated a small grille in the bottom center position, sported a pair of side scoops that helped the vehicle get a better aerodynamic coefficient. From its profile, the P9 sedan featured a curved roofline with a sloped-back windscreen followed by a short deck. Finally, at the back, XPeng installed a long red light strip between the taillights. Inside, the front high-bolstered front seats could have been completely reclined, converting the cabin into a sleeping place so those who lay down there could stare at the stars through the glass roof. The dashboard was fitted with a small screen in front of the driver and a portrait-mode touchscreen placed instead of the center stack above the center console. In the back, there was plenty of room for three passengers. Since the car was built on the same platform as the G3, it was available exclusively with a front-wheel drive system.

Xpeng G6,"XPeng unveiled the G6 electric crossover coupe in the spring of 2023 for the 2024 model year, and the new vehicle showed a more composed design, which was called tech-fluid aesthetics by the carmaker's representatives. With less than a decade passed since the brand's establishment, the Chinese automaker seemed to be on a mission to cover all grounds. By 2023 it already had a small-sized crossover and two sedans on its lineup. In addition, a big-sized SUV named P9 was already competing with other electric crossovers on the market, like the Tesla Model X. The 2024 G6 had already adopted the automaker's design language, which consisted of an LED strip that crossed the front fascia. Below it was a panel that housed the angular-shaped headlights and a lower, trapezoidal grille placed at the bottom of the bumper. From its profile, the coupe-shaped vehicle sported retractable door handles, like in a Range Rover, and a sloped-down roofline that resembled a Porsche Cayenne Coupe. Finally, at the back, XPeng dropped the idea of a continuous red light strip and placed two distinct LED taillights instead. Inside, the automaker installed a pair of high-bolstered front seats that could have been completely reclined, thus converting the car into a sleeping place. On the dashboard, the automaker installed a 15” touchscreen atop the center stack for the infotainment system. Fronting the driver, a second display showed the speed, navigation, range, and other critical information to those behind the wheel. In the back, there was enough room for three passengers on the split-folding benchseat. Thanks to its new 800 volts architecture and the newly developed engines, the G6 boasted a range of over 700 km (435 miles) for the version fitted with the biggest battery pack.

Xpeng G9,"The Chinese automaker introduced the G9 in 2022, targeting premium automakers worldwide with this battery-powered SUV. XPeng was on a mission to cover all grounds with its vehicles. It didn't limit itself to producing just one entry-level car and working its way up. It built larger ones to compete against vehicles like the Tesla Model X. Even though the carmaker didn't have such a high automotive experience, it had highly skilled engineers who previously worked for other car brands. The G9 was a full-size SUV with an intriguing design that was later carried over to other products made by XPeng. Thus, at the front, the car featured a LED strip that crossed the vehicle from left to right. Underneath it, the carmaker installed a large panel instead of a grille. This bodywork element also housed the angular-shaped headlights. Since the car was electric, it didn't need massive cooling areas, so the only grille installed was on the lower side of the bumper. From its profile, the G9 had a greenhouse that covered one-third of the vehicle's height and featured darkened B- and C-pillars. At the back, the D-pillars and the racked-forward tailgate completed the car's dynamic look. Another interesting feature was the retractable door handles, which resembled those installed in the Land Rover Range Rover Velar. Inside, the five-seat interior boasted expensive materials and advanced infotainment systems. At the front, the bolstered seats and fronted a dashboard covered in leather on the lower side and high-quality foam on the upper side. In addition, it supported three displays: one in front of the driver and the other two, 14.9” in size, were placed atop the center stack and on the passenger's side. A tall center console with a storage shelf on the lower side separated the two front occupants. XPeng offered the G9 in a rear or an all-wheel drive configuration with one or two motors.",Xpeng,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""G9"",  ""year"": ""2022"",  ""size"": ""full-size SUV"",  ""overall-design"": [""premium"", ""intriguing"", ""dynamic"", ""expensive"", ""advanced""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""large panel"", ""angular-shaped""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""angular-shaped""],    ""bumper"": [""lower side grille""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [""retractable handles""],    ""roof"": [""racked-forward tailgate""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
Xpeng P7,"XPeng launched its second model, the P7, in 2019, and it surprised everyone with its impressive range, even for the base model, and some additional quirky features. Just four years have passed since the creation of this Chinese brand, and people were already talking a lot about it. Helped by tech giants such as Xiaomi and smart engineers with automotive backgrounds, XPeng managed to create unusual vehicles. So, after introducing the G3 EV crossover, which was already born with autonomous driving level 2, came the P7, which boasted luxurious features usually seen on much more expensive cars. At the front, the vehicle sported a sharp look with an LED strip that crossed the car as a daytime running light. The actual headlights were mounted lower on the bumper, which also integrated the low-mounted grille. From its profile, the P7 showed its fluid, organic shape. There was not any straight line on any part of the vehicle. The cab-rearward design with a sloped-down rear windscreen suggested a hatchback. Yet, it was a three-box sedan. At the back, the taillights and the red LED strip that adorned the rear fascia mimicked the front of the vehicle. Inside, the automaker tried its best to outrun its competition. At the front, a pair of high-bolstered seats provided comfort and were separated by a tall center console. On the dashboard, the automaker installed a 10.25” display in front of the driver for the instrument panel and a 15” touchscreen for the infotainment system placed atop the center stack. In addition, the Chinese automaker worked with Dynaudio to create a powerful sound experience. XPeng offered the P7 with a choice of three drivetrains. The base version was RWD only and could travel up to 586 km (364 miles). By using the same motor but an 80.9 kWh battery pack, the Super-Long Range version provided a 706 km (439 miles) range. For those willing to trade range for power, the automaker offered a third version fitted with two motors and an all-wheel drive setup.",Xpeng,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""P7"",  ""year"": ""2019"",  ""size"": ""sedan"",  ""overall-design"": [""sharp"", ""luxurious"", ""fluid"", ""organic"", ""cab-rearward""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""sloped-down""],    ""grille"": [""low-mounted""],    ""hood"": [],    ""headlights"": [""LED"", ""sharp""],    ""bumper"": [""integrated"", ""low-mounted""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""sloped""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
Zenvo Aurora,"The Danish car manufacturer Zenvo unveiled the Aurora hypercar at a private event on the eve preceding the Monterey Car Week in August 2023. But while most people expected to see one vehicle, there were actually two: the Agil and the Tur. While the former was built mainly for performance, the latter was created by Zenvo to be a touring vehicle with mind-blowing performance. The Danish automaker Zenvo was not its first vehicle when it made the Aurora. Previously, it had developed and successfully launched the TSR, the TS1 GT, and the ST1, to name just a few. Zenvo developed these hypercars from the ground up, and it also created the engines and the technology behind them to outperform and outrun most other cars from the niche segment of supercars. With the Aurora, the Danish car manufacturer proved that electrification works great, especially on such go-fast vehicles. But it wasn't just about the engines and motors' output. It was also about design, aerodynamics, and unique features that made the Aurora a distinct piece of engineering marvel on the market. The Agile was the first to leave Zenvo's laboratories. The car manufacturer made it around a carbon-fiber ZM1 modular monocoque design. This element ensures not just the vehicle's rigid structure but it is a safety cell as well. In addition, it allowed the automaker to create a car with exposed suspension elements and an incorporated engine compartment in the same cell structure as the cockpit. Many automakers tried the monocoque solution before, but usually, they attached the engine compartment to the rest of the structure. At the front, the pinched-out, narrow front end resembled the same shape as an open-wheel racer but with LED headlights that flanked it. Under the car's nose, Zenvo installed a carbon-fiber splitter that increased the downforce. It wasn't there just for decorations. On its profile, the Aurora Agil revealed its curved, long windshield followed by the arched roofline and the sloped back where the manufacturer placed the engine compartment's lid. Finally, at the back, a large wing adorned the rear end. Altogether with other aerodynamic enhancements of the vehicle, the Aurora Agil provided a downforce of 1940 lbs (880 kg) at 155 mph (250 kph). Inside, the Aurora Agil boasted exposed carbon fiber elements on the center stack, dashboard, and seats. In front of the driver, the automaker installed a three-dial instrument panel where the left one swiveled independently to reveal the infotainment's system that featured wireless connectivity with smartphones. In addition, the right dial could do the same trick that revealed an LCD for the driving dynamics modes and performance. That was unusual and unique on the market. Behind the cockpit, Zenvo installed a quad-turbo hot V12 that produced a massive 1250 PS (1233 HP), but that wasn't all. Helped by an integrated e-motor, it could reach 1,450 PS (1430 HP). Combined with another two motors, the total output reaches 1,850 PS (1825 HP).",Zenvo,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""Aurora"",  ""year"": ""2023"",  ""size"": ""N/A"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""aerodynamic"", ""sleek"", ""modern"", ""innovative""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [""curved"", ""long""],    ""grille"": [],    ""hood"": [""pinched-out"", ""narrow""],    ""headlights"": [""LED""],    ""bumper"": [""carbon-fiber splitter""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""arched""],    ""diffusor"": [],    ""spoiler"": [""large""],    ""exhaust"": [""quad-turbo hot V12""]  }}```"
Zenvo TS1,"The small Danish company Zenvo made a second generation for its supercar. While the first was named ST1, the second received the TS1 name. Still weird, as the look of the vehicle. There were only 15 units produced from the first generation of the ST1, and one burned during a test-drive for a British TV program. But the small car-manufacturer didn't close its shop. It returned to the drawing board and released a better car for 2017. But it didn't work too much on the alien-ship look of the exterior but focused more on the interior and the engineering side. There were not too many changes for the TS1 over the ST1. At the front, a pair of splitters appeared on the side of the spoiler and a big wing was installed at the back of the car. But the overall shape was still the same. Inside, there was a mix of Alcantara, carbon-fiber, aluminum, and leather for the sport-bucket seats. The instrument cluster was no longer fitted with analog dials but with a TFT display. The infotainment unit mounted on the center stalk was bigger and offered more options, including Bluetooth connectivity. The engineering side was completely different. While the ST1 was powered by a 7.0-liter V8 supercharged and turbocharged, the TS1 featured an in-house developed 5.8-liter V8 with two superchargers. The total output was 1104 hp and it was mated either to a 7-speed dog-gear or a 7-speed automatic. Unlike its predecessor, it featured a Torsen limited-slip differential.",Zenvo,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""TS1"",  ""year"": ""2017"",  ""size"": ""small"",  ""overall-design"": [""alien-ship look"", ""sporty"", ""sleek""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""big"", ""prominent""],    ""hood"": [""same as ST1""],    ""headlights"": [],    ""bumper"": [""pair of splitters""],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [],    ""diffusor"": [""big wing at the back""],    ""spoiler"": [],    ""exhaust"": []  }}```"
Zenvo TSR-S,"The third model in the Zenovo’s lineup, the extremely powerful TSR-S was launched in 2018. Zenovo’s first model was the TS1 GT, a legal road car. The second model, the TSR was a track only car, and the TSR-S was the street legal TSR. Aesthetically, the TSR-S featured an extremely aggressive and aerodynamic design with the large central front grille, the new lighter headlights, the large aggressive shapes, the huge cooling vents in the hood and the scoop on the roof - all these visual design cues screamed power. At the rear, the main attraction was the enormous active rear wing that pivoted from side to side to help with downforce through cornering. Under the wing, the TSR-S had an aggressive rear diffuser, as well as big exhaust tail pipes. To keep it as light as possible, the TSR-S offered no luxurious features, not even air conditioning, airbags or a radio. Almost everything was made of carbon fiber, the car weighing only 1,495 kg. Fitted with a 5.8-liter twin-supercharged engine, the exotic vehicle hid no less than 1200 ponies under its hood and reached 100 km/h in just 2.8 seconds. The aggressive car was limited to 325 km/h. Inside, the carbon fiber bucket seats, the racing harness sets, a small racing steering wheel and a customised info system were the only things you could look at. The TSR-S was very exclusive, with only 5 units built per year.",Zenvo,"```json{  ""car-model"": ""TSR-S"",  ""year"": ""2018"",  ""size"": ""lightweight"",  ""overall-design"": [""aggressive"", ""aerodynamic"", ""powerful"", ""exclusive""],  ""design-elements"": {    ""windshield"": [],    ""grille"": [""large"", ""central""],    ""hood"": [""aggressive"", ""large"", ""cooling vents""],    ""headlights"": [""lighter""],    ""bumper"": [],    ""wheel"": [],    ""doors"": [],    ""roof"": [""scoop""],    ""diffusor"": [""rear"", ""aggressive""],    ""spoiler"": [""enormous"", ""active""],    ""exhaust"": [""big""]  }}```"
