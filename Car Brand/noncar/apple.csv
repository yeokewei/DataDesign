870,3031,,,,,i was an android guy for years had phone after phone and loved the features never intended to switch but my company switched us to apple the i realized apple products do not get hot do not have to be reset all the time and just work consistently i still miss the features and customization of android but i do not miss the unreliability ,45,POSITIVE,Stable,related to apple products,
872,3036,,,,,i had a samsung android phone for a long time and i really loved the customization and individuality it allowed but since getting an iphone it is hard to say if i will ever switch back and there are 2 main reasons 1 the reliability yes it is true that for every new feature on the iphone samsung likely had a version of it that came out years ago however when iphone does implement a feature it works much more smoothly and reliably there feels like less bugs and lags with new features on iphones 2 the interconnectivity say you have an iphone want some headphones sure there may be brands that are rated higher in consumer reviews but airpods are still good and nothing else will connect to your devices like air pods will want a smart watch no other smart watch will have as much ease of use and ease of connection to your phone as an apple watch will i still compare shop for all my devices but if you already have one apple product it is going to make every other apple product that much better as a choice eventually you own multiple apple products and you feel silly for considering a third party product that will be slower and not work as well with your devices even if it is supposed to be better ,52,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,

889,3063,,,,,i am in a poor country and i am very much middle class 5 years ago i bought a 128gb iphone 7 still works very well even though for a big chunk of those 5 years i was addicted to my phone and used it 10 hours a day i have never seen an android user around me say this about their old phone and i did not even buy ny phone when it came out it was already a 2 year old product at that point i started university as a med student i realised i need a tablet to not waste so much paper and ink money to print out all the slides that every professor uploads also i could not afford all the medical books that i would only use 10 15 pages of so i invested in ipad 9th gen and an apple pencil makes my studying so much more productive worth every penny ,3,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,

898,3084,,,,,because the hardware is really good and lasts for year with a very high quality user experience i have a macbook air from 2015 that still performs perfectly for my everyday tasks which include programming computer intensive tasks music recording production and using specific software to design pcbs as well as usual tasks the experience of doing all that did not change throughout the years the computer is not slower i never had to reinstall the os everything works perfectly the main problem would be that today i can only work 2 hours unplugged before running out of power which seems perfectly normal to me after 8years the os also offers the best user experience by far you do not need to fight it to install stuff i never reinstalled it but it is not getting slower there is no need for an antivirus except you are dumb and click on stupid things it is not intrusive and lets you concentrate on what you are doing instead of showing popups asking if you are really really sure you want to perform an action basically it works extremely well for an extremely long time i never had that experience with any pcs i used it might be a bit cheaper but it comes with a world of frustration and buying another one much quicker i wish people asking this question would stop assuming it is because of the design and would consider that it is just because it works better,2,POSITIVE,Stable,related to apple products,
899,3087,,,,,there is always a lot of relevant criticism but from a personal point of view i still go for apple because i am still using my 2011 macbook air and 2010 ipad for everyday stuff without a problem after all these years yes it is slower but i can not imagine having the same productivity for so long with other laptops or tablets but i would be happy to be corrected ,2,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,

904,3108,,,,,i am way late and nobody will see this but apple makes their money off hardware not user data as a result the product is more expensive but the experience is superior when the design is built around a product that works rather than a product that funnels advertisements you get a better product ,2,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,

943,3202,,,,,ipads are also much more reasonably priced than other apple products ,285,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,
946,3210,,,,,this is the first apple argument i can not counter and i applaud you for it thanks for pointing this out ,718,POSITIVE,Friendly,related to apple products,
947,3214,,,,,man you really should at least consider getting an iphone since you have already got an ipad and know ipados the fact that i do not have to even think about syncing aaaaaaaanything between my tech devices is just so wonderful and magic clipboard lives up to its name you can copy and paste between devices as long as they are in physical proximity and it requires nothing more than copying on one and pasting on the other no trickery nothing it just works and really that is a big part of why i stick with apple is ecosystem my shit requires almost no maintenance at all i did about a decade in tech support all platforms client and server personal and corporate and apple is stuff just truly does not require the fuss that other platforms do ,16,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,
949,3219,,,,,yep that is basically the reasons i bought into it but i have never looked back for the following reason that has come to my attention after use user experience i download a program and it works perfectly and efficiently why because apple will only let me download the version of the app that fully utilises the features to the best of the ability of the current operating system and specs i can not download something that is not optimised for the os and specs therefore i have never have to troubleshoot a single thing that is unreal quality control that only exists to ensure i am never frustrated by use apple knows and capitalises on how people use technology to create better ergonomics so they release multiple products to use the same programs and those programs sync across the products i will use my homepod or siri in the car to add groceries to my groceries list and then pull out my phone to review them when at the shops i am able to add them when i have those thoughts without having to go through the process of opening an app let is face it it is easier to do that when saying to your partner we are out of x  i set reminders via my phone to add a to do list for work because they allow me to add specific detail which i will not do via siri or homepod necessarily to ensure that detail is translated those reminders are then presented to me on my macbook screen that way i am not checking my phone to review something which is easier because i will not be accomplishing this through my phone i use my ipad to control music in my house it is easier to manage because the apple music app is arranged to fit in your hands easier than scrolling on my phone using two thumbs i just scroll with one thumb and use my free hand to utilise other movements it is literally designed to be easier to use not harder yes android can be customised more but what use is that if i am not able to utilise said customisation effectively i used to be a chromecast and pixel fanboy the camera on the 3a is better than on my iphone 12 but by allowing the technology to not be bogged down by inconvenience and by integrating the technology together due to tight quality control it is more than just the individual parts it is far far easier to use without being frustrated whenever i need to do something new i attempt to do it in the first way i would think of i am usually successful because that is the design ethos around making them work not a single other company cares about making these things easier to use plus the length of time for software support is double the minimum required by law i pay an extra 15percent and my usage is doubled i am literally saving money over time ,1,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,
951,3224,,,,,this is something i am envious of as an android user everything on apple just meshes ,42,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,
954,3232,,,,,i am exactly the same i have been using iphones since 2011 and i just like them more for a while i had a macbook for work and i loved how well it worked with my ipad and iphone they just feel so much nicer than androids to me ,26,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,
955,3234,,,,,the only apple product i use is the macbook i have switched between laptops but the macbook is built like a modern smartphone you can hold it with one hand and do not have to be afraid of the chassis cracking any other apple product seems like a luxury to me you might say that macbooks are more expensive but as a previous windows user you have to calculate the costs of repairing the broken parts and getting them serviced macbooks have the best mobile computer hardware according to a lot of people who have experienced it first hand ,48,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,

963,3271,,,,,not just replacement apps but the ecosystem is just so damn seamless that any device not part of the walled garden kinda breaks the experience airpods are connected to all your devices at once and switch between them instantly you can move your mouse between your mac and your ipad or use it as an extended monitor your phone is a webcam for your desktop your watch unlocks your computer when you walk up i also have a surface pro and a galaxy fold and they are both great devices but whenever i use it it feels odd that they do not talk to each other the same way ,25,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,
964,3272,,,,,on top of that the ecosystem is just mindblowing if you have a full apple setup iphone macbook and ipad and yeah maybe you could fix that with other software and apps but i actually like it when i just get it when i buy the product it justifies the fact that i have to pay a bit more some of the replacements would also not be free you also have to take that in mind apple just gives you them with their product which you paid for ofc ,50,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,

1330,4640,,,,,right but it is a valid question for those who just bought and could technically return and m2 and get a brand new generation for a bit more or whatever in my case i will check it out but chances are will just keep this beautiful machine having said that if there is something interesting that comes up that would be a smart move i can not rule it out since i intend to be with the apple ecosystem for future  i guess i am lucky i can drive 10 km if i choose to return it without any issues ,3,POSITIVE,Elegant,related to apple products,

1340,4661,,,,,yup hugely remorseful i love this thing though and it is the best computer i have ever owned or used i will probably hold onto it for a bit only thing that would change my mind is substantial battery or screen brightness improvements which would be tough since i am already getting 10 20 running a windows vm all day ,2,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,

1375,4782,,,,,i have seen these myself many years back when i went to one of these factories to be fair this is a contract manufacturer that makes stuff for everyone including apple in fact apple does lots of third party audits to make sure there is no slave labor and also that workers have good working conditions that make their products you can read on their supplier responsibility report they publish every year there has also been other improvements done such as break every 4 hours more social activities for workers on off days etc yes it used to be very bad but things have improved per their report now going back to many years ago when i went there first i asked the factory folks whom i met the deal behind this and they told again take with grain of salt that a few attempts they had before was because whenever one person attempted and was successful died m their family would receive about dollar200k in compensation which was a massive amount for them usually these folks come from small towns or rural areas later they changed their contracts so they do not have to pay in case anything happens and also changed working conditions anyways those nets still exists last went to a factory about 2 years back but working conditions looked a lot better now than 8 10 years back ,1,POSITIVE,Stable,related to apple products,

1465,5099,,,,,repetitive but i will allow it,24,POSITIVE,Elegant,related to apple products,
1493,5181,,,,,i feel like apple could remain in good graces with their core fans even while raising prices if they just focused on small value adds like including a fast charger in the box there is a large group of people that do not mind shelling out big bucks as long as they do not feel that they are being nickel and dimed at every turn as well ,4180,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,
1495,5183,,,,,apple is very concerned ,31,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,
1501,5234,,,,,if you look away from the ui and appstore the new galaxy s10 is really an amazing value especially if you stack it against any device in apple is current iphone line up and despite me not loving samsung is design choices and materials used for the s10 line up i can safely say that if ios was available for the s10 then i would not hesitate about switching for one second keep in mind i have never owned anything but iphones downvote me to the depths of hell i am just being honest ,3,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,

1507,5260,,,,,apple meh,1,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,
1508,5266,,,,,i feel like they used to be decently generous with their offerings on high price items the earlier macbook pros or even their powerpc predecessors came with a variety of dongles chargers screen cleaners etc it felt like apple took care of you if you were shelling out the big bucks ,102,POSITIVE,Elegant,related to apple products,
1509,5267,,,,,i remember with a macbook pro and an ipad in mid 2000 is laptop came with charger extension firewire usb and display adaptors no doubt cost them bugger all but saved me another trip to the store and maybe dollar50 little touch but made all the difference same with first ipods usb and firewire adaptors in the box most probably never used them but they were there regardless for those of us that did they cost bugger all and it was appreciated greatly now i balk at the added expense which sucks and i buy third party out of spite they might want my extra handful of dollardollardollardollar for the shitty addons they should just provide but they will never get it it sucks for those of us that remember how it used to be ,42,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,
1510,5268,,,,,this really is key in the past it was easy to justify apple products at high costs because it was always seen as a premium brand with premium products you felt like you were paying more but there was the apple magic that they have thought of everything for you before you realize you needed it i do not mind that they got rid of the 3 5mm i really do not i switched to bluetooth years ago and have not looked back but on the extremely rare cases you needed a dollar9 adapter that really cost some dollar3 to make it feels cheapened that you had to go and buy it  this is across the board back in the day buying an macbook meant you got a charger and extender cable now when you buy an additional charger it does not even come with a usb c cable that feels cheap when you buy an apple tv it does not come with hdmi that feels cheap when you buy an iphone it does not come with a fast charger that feels cheap i mean the imac used to come with a remote for christ is sakes i can not remember the last time i felt wow ed by an apple product unboxing it is not even the practical nature the problem is that they are lowering the feeling of the premium brand which is the real problem you do not feel like you just spent money on a high end product anymore that magic of opening a new apple product to be surprised by oh look they even included that is no longer there it now feels like you just bought a utilitarian product that is expensive i am deep in the ecosystem but it used to be that the competiton is price was better or specs were better while apple is brand experience is better now that they are diminishing the brand experience i am not sure what people will do ,30,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,
1513,5279,,,,,you are right the galaxy s10 phone will charge the iphone faster than the charger the iphone ships with ,16,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,
1514,5281,,,,,totally agree when i bought my first ipod 4th gen it came with cables headphones a dock all kinds of goodies really made it feel like it was worth the money over the past 5 10 years it really feels like that is an area where apple has significan notly cut back ,3,POSITIVE,Elegant,related to apple products,

1516,5302,,,,,this video is so spot on ,2,POSITIVE,Dynamic,related to apple products,
1518,5312,,,,,i do not understand why this makes you worried vp of environment lisa jackson had a spot at the last iphone event that explicitly made the point that apple is focus is on making their phones usable for a longer period of time this was also the launch of ios 12 which had a big focus on increasing the performance on old 5s 6 and 6s phones and it delivered on that promise i have been using an old 5s for the past few weeks and it is quite usable much more than it was last year people complained about new os is slowing down their phones for years and how they had to buy a new phone every 2 years to be able to run the current software apple is the only company delivering on these concerns if people buy a dollar1000 phone and have confidence that they or someone in their family can get 4 5 years of usable life out of it is that so much worse than buying a dollar650 phone and feeling like they need to upgrade in 2 years ,5,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,
1522,5322,,,,, innovation phase has ended it will only be incremental stuff from here on out perhaps but i wonder if they are going to wow us again with some kind of ar device glasses i have only seen rumors about the development but would be interesting to see apple is take on it ,3,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,
1523,5327,,,,,a macbook for example becomes vintage after 7 years but it is not obsolete yet that means apple will make repairs and updates for it until they will announce the obsolescence my dad still uses a 2010 imac on high sierra that came out in 2017 and is still being updated dude no one can make you buy an apple pc laptop but you have to understand the appeal and comfort of these products in fact everyone should ,3,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,
1524,5339,,,,,in my view that was an enormous part of steve job is approach it was about the customer experience from the very moment you purchased the product and then throughout its life cycle you paid premium but everything from the first intro song that macs used to play to the mag safe adapter was designed to be thoughtful and considerate of your experience with the final product the overall impression you were left with was a sense of money well spent and a quality experience as well as a quality product that has become secondary and apple products have lost much of their magic as a result ,1565,POSITIVE,Elegant,related to apple products,
1526,5342,,,,,when they raised the price of the base macbook pro 2018 8th gen intel to dollar1799 and also do not supply it with an extension cord anymore but sell it for dollar19 separately i simply went out and bought a pc laptop last week to replace my macbook with the no travel keyboard not out of spite simply windows 10 is looking good and i like pcs that you can upgrade yourself and add a 1tb drive without it costing dollar1000 i was going to buy the new macbook air but when they got rid of the stellar keyboard of the past and raised the price and put in a poor dim screen that was a deal breaker the fact when you buy a dollar1500 phone and you have to pay dollar50 for a separate fast charger seriously yep nickel and dime ,29,POSITIVE,Modern,related to apple products,
