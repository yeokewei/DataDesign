158,,,,,i do not know if it is dumb this kind of regulation is what protects consumers there are so few label terms that are actually regulated by law the ones that are are actually important because they are usually about protecting people is health sterilization does not happen in people is homes but it is a normal process if you work in any certain types of manufacturing or biotech or even just in a hospital there is regular sterilization of tools and instruments done everyday and those kind of environments at home people use bleach all the time to try and achieve a similar effect to sterilization i think the danger is in a non scientific person believing that they could use something like this to kill a virus or a fungus imagine you needed to sterilize surfaces in your home after a family member has an illness or has a compromised immune system i would google what words or certifications or symbols to look for on cleaning products or wet wipes to make sure i was buying the right thing you could end up buying something that is mislabeled and think you are killing virus when the wipe really does not plus imagine the precedent it sets if the government lets some companies mislabel their products without any penalty but holds other companies accountable for making sure that what is on the label is actually in the product the only alternative is to have no standards and enforce no regulations allowing companies to put whatever they want into food and personal care items and selling them as a completely different product we need these kind of protections against unregulated capitalism ,49.0,POSITIVE,related to daiso,Elegant,
161,,,,,definitely seems important distinction to maintain and it makes sense to require them to not use that label i also just wonder if any consumers were actually misled into thinking that they were doing anything different than what they might have done with any other similar cleaning wipe ,1.0,POSITIVE,related to daiso,Modern,
