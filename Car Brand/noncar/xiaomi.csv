132,481,,,,,tldr snapdragon 8g3 is the first mobile soc based off armv9 2 64 bit only it still uses tsmc is n4p node like the 8 g1 and 8g2 besides using arm is brand new core architecture x4 a720 a520 it also now uses a 1 5 2 core configuration instead of the 8g2 is 1 4 3 or the more traditional 1 3 4 in the 8 g1 arm is new cortex x4 big core boasts some very decent improvements in st performance 20percent over the previous x3 in the likes of the snapdragon 8g2 however power consumption has also increased accordingly so st efficiency is not noticeably improved this is mostly fine considering the big core is generally leveraged to handle short and bursty workloads in order to make the phone feel snappy and fast still noticeably behind apple is a16 a17 pro in terms of st performance efficiency though the a720 medium core and a520 small core are mostly incremental upgrades both in terms of performance and efficiency over their predecessors a720 does get a pretty sweet efficiency improvement in floating point compute but nothing crazy the swapping of yet another small core for a medium core results in some very nice mt performance improvements now putting the snapdragon 8g3 pretty much ahead of the a17 pro is perf w in gb 5 and matching it in gb 6 qualcomm has officially catched up to apple in mt performance and efficiency it does remain slightly less efficient at lower power levels though apparently this chipset is capable of partially turning off its l3 cache and slc to save power but we still do not know much about how that would work and whether it requires software based scheduling or not the gpu is yet again a noticeable upgrade over the sd 8g2 and seems to mostly come from scaling up the compute like 8g2 did over 8 g1 8g2 was already on top of the competition when it came to gpu so this upgrade pretty much puts 8g3 in a class of its own when it comes to both performance and efficiency on the gpu side it completely overshadows every other smartphone chipset and even seems to match the performance a radeon 780m gtx 1050ti with an overclock overall 8g3 is a very solid upgrade over the 8g2 which was already a beast of an soc none of the performance or efficiency improvements are groundbreaking by any means but they are definitely great 8g3 vs 8g2 is a jump pretty much equivalent to 8g2 vs 8 g1 both in terms of cpu and gpu performance efficiency this really puts to shame google is tensor g3 which is barely a performance efficiency improvement over the notoriously bad tensor g2 samsung foundries at it again the amount of competition qualcomm is putting up with apple is really exciting to see ,65.0,POSITIVE,related to xiaomi review ,Modern,
133,492,,,,,cool quest 4 d still do not need standalone p anyway cool piece of hardware ,-4.0,POSITIVE,related to xiaomi review ,Stable,
134,499,,,,,their little cores are fairly huge and still significan notly lead on perf watt compared to everyone else and at much higher performance this remains a key advantage for them if you profile what it is doing even intense things like games try to keep mostly on the little cores and send things to the big cores in blips so this saves on soc power ,21.0,POSITIVE,related to xiaomi review ,Powerful,

145,563,,,,, that is marketing you dingus you think marketing runs their developer outreach too x200b optimize for apple silicon with performance and efficiency cores  recent apple silicon like a13 bionic has both high performance cores p cores and high efficiency cores e cores  these different core types allow you to deliver apps that have both great performance and great battery life  to take full advantage of their performance and efficiency you can provide the operating system os with information about how to execute your app in the most optimal way  from there the os uses semantic information to make better scheduling and performance control decisions  so one moment you say  the reference e cores are so weak nowadays  and the next you say there is no set descriptive idea for what an e core should do  on iphones they absolutely are for performance  there is 4 of them vs 2 p cores and they are quite fast  they do a huge amount of heavy lifting  intel is are also for performance lol intel is e cores are for performance  lol then why are not they called p cores then ,2.0,POSITIVE,related to xiaomi review ,Dynamic,

think this is not a big deal to anyone but it is indeed refreshing to have amoled instead of ips lcd the display is spectacular i have low expectations lol but the colors are so vibrant and i love it second the refresh rate recommends me using the default one which is the adaptive refresh rate where it changes depending on how you are using the device which i think is battery consuming on default the phone is displaying up to 144hz something but there is the custom option where you can choose to have either 60hz or 144hz which sucks so i stuck with default the dynamic one third battery life i was actually alarmed at first when i literally used it after getting it out of the box on how fast the battery drains though i had not optimized it yet but dang those fancy things drain the battery so much the always on display which is cool but unfortunately eats up the battery the refresh rate dynamic one and it is extreme brightness under auto brightness i do not want to disable anything because i have this thought that i upgraded to this one because of these features so turning them off would be useless that is on me  fourth it is smooth as for most part i have the 12 256 variant with expandable ram i forgot how much i did not expand it because i have not tried doing much tasks at once so it is a win for me fifth dolby atmos i like listening to music or streaming and dolby atmos changed the game the sounds became clear like you can each instrument being used in a music lastly idk if it is a me problem a phone problem or a wifi problem but a few hours ago was the first i

313,1531,xiaomi,xiaomi 11t pro personal review after 10 months a great phone held off by poor optimization,i used to own a redmi note 8 pro it was a great phone but after 3 years i started to feel the need for a worthy upgrade with a budget of 400 euros i conducted some research and stumbled upon the xiaomi 11t pro it had everything i needed a powerful cpu a smooth and bright amoled screen with nice features such as hdr 10 support a big battery with super fast charging a competent camera system and an overall fantastic specsheet no other phone offered more at that price at the time of my research i have used it for 10 months and i feel like i wanted to share my experience with you  design  the overall aestetichs are a bit generic since it is very similar to many other xiaomi models but personally i find it quite elegant build quality is really solid both the screen and the back are covered in gorilla glass victus which gives it some really good protection the side rails are made in sturdy feeling alluminum with a grippy matte surface i am not sure if that means it is anodyzed and the top side of the phone features a flat glass surface which houses the top speaker and an ir blaster along with a harman kardon label etched under the glass which i find to be quite a cool detail the back panel houses the three cameras and the bump is quite evident the glass on the back has a brushed alluminum look it attracts a lot of fingerprints and it is slippery unfortunately there is only a ip53 rating but i think there is still a pretty good protection from splashes of water judging by gorilla glass victus and the rubber ring around the sim tray  display it is amazing it is a flat 6 7 amoled panel with vivid colors great contrast and absolute black it is plenty bright for most situations altough i will discuss an issue regarding brightness in the performance and software section the 120hz refresh rate and 480hz sampling rate make for a really smooth experience and the phone automatically switches to 60hz when using multimedia apps like youtube or netflix to save some battery but this is not really adaptive refresh rate since it does not work like some more advanced panel that can switch in a wide range of frequency at any second the software simply knows to switch to 60hz when using certain apps it has support for hdr 10 10 bit colors and dolby vision which is all nice to have  camera system this phone has got a pretty good camera system that is able to take great pictures in pretty much every lighting condition it is not the best since it lacks ois but it still an interesting set of cameras the 108mp main sensor performs really well images are vivid and clear 108mp mode is useful if you want to get some more details or want to get a less processed image xiaomi is processing tends to make photos look oversharpened with a bit too much contrast since more mp better quality you will find that a smartphone sensor simply is not able to capture enough light to make full advantage of all the pixels and in some situations you might get noise videos on the main sensor are really good and it can record up to 8k ai but it is completely unstabilized so i usually go with 4k which gives you eis but i still really wish it had ois it can also record in hdr10 and i have tested it it appears like it makes colors a bit less vibrant than the default mode and goes for a more cinematic look which is nice for some uses but it certainly is a niche feature since recording in this mode might give you some compatibility issues if you are trying to share your video on social media platforms the 8mp uw is also pretty good it does not feel like a downgrade when switching from the main sensor and the images it takes are still pretty crisp it performs decently in low light when using night mode but it is not great in more challenging conditions for example when the sun is in the background it can only record in 1080p the 5mp macro really impressed me this is possibly one of the very few phones to have an actually good macro camera it can focus from really up close and altough 5mp is not a high resolution details are much better than all the other 2mp macro cameras found in many other phones i was impressed by the results you can get with some editing as mentioned before resolution is not very high and you will only get good results in daylight but this is a step above many phones here is a post i have made with some macro footage  the selfie camera is just average and that is true for the majority of xiaomi is models  speakers the dual speaker setup in this phone is really good they are pretty loud the sound has depht and the harman kardon tuning and dolby atmos add to a really enjoyable sound experience the earpiece works together with the top speaker in phone calls the only issue during calls is the proximity sensor that is not reliable enough sometimes i would put the phone on my ear then take it away but the screen would not come back on  battery life and charging battery life on this phone is good but not awesome it can last a day pretty easily with intense use but when its used outside at high brightness and mobile data you might need to charge it towards 7 8 pm with a usage mixed between mobile data high brightness and wifi lower brightness i get an average of 7h sot i was able to get 9 10h hours in a best case scenario inside use only also power consumption in standby is higher than normal sometimes it drains 2 3percent in a hour of standby but to make up for the not incredible battery life this phone has the super crazy 120w fast charging and i can say for sure that it changed my standards for charging in optimal conditions the battery managed to fill up completely in 17 18 minutes device placed directly on a fan just as advertised by xiaomi in most conditions it takes around 21 minutes which is still impressive the factor that most affects the speed of the 120w charging is heat sometimes the battery would reach 46c while charging mostly during summer which is still under control but its a high temperature so just keep an eye on that  performance and software this is where things start to get complicated the 11t pro is equipped with the infamous snapdragon 888 5g a very powerful chip notorious for its overheating issues to be fair the 11t pro handles it better than other devices with the same soc since it appears to have an effective hardware cooling system with big vapor chambers and graphite during normal use the device does not really get hot altough it starts getting warm after one hour of use and this is still normal even while gaming thermals seem to stay under control and the cpu does not throtthle i ran a few benchmarks and got consistently good results antutu 817799 points 3d mark wildlife extreme stress test stability 85percent highest loop score 1440 lowest loop score 1217 battery drained 13percent  problems start to arise when you least expect it sometimes it gets hot during completely normal tasks like browsing or messaging which might start to throtthle down the cpu this issue is much more evident if the device is being used outside during summer my phone would start warming up already from inside my pocket when using mobile data and if i started using it with high brightness to be able to see the screen under direct sunlight it would randomly drop to 50percent even if the slider was maxed up with no way to bring it back up other than turning it off and letting it cool down and to top it all off refresh rate would drop massivelly making the ui feel really sluggish this made using my phone outside very hard since brightness would drop the second it saw a bit of light after some research i have confirmed this is a consequence of overheating meaning that the display will automatically drop brightness and refresh rate when a certain temperature is reached but the inefficient soc is not the only reason for these issues since i have also found miui to be quite poorly optimized even during light tasks especially after the miui 14 update which is a shame because i really like the miui interface but xiaomi does not seem to optimize it properly for each device leading to situations where high end smartphones slow down during completely normal use do not get me wrong the 11t pro 8 256 is a quick and smooth phone that can handle anything you throw at it from multitasking to games on max graphics at 60 framerates but sometimes it shows the effects of that poor optimization  verdict for the 10 months i have owned it the xiaomi 11t pro has been an excellent device but not without its flaws right now it can be bought for 400 euros and for that price you are essentially getting a flagship specsheet with a solid build quality fantastic screen a good camera system great speakers and powerful hardware the problem i have encountered with this device has been overheating and consequently battery drain caused by a powerful but inefficient chip and a poorly optimized miui so did i regret buying it no but i am definitely upset that a device that has so much potential is limited by such issues  pros  solid build

316,1543,,,,,my personal and quick review after 13 months the phone is good on paper but good specs do not translate in good performances sometimes snapdragon 888 is a thermal nightmare play a game record a video browse tiktok or use the device outdoor on a hot sunny day and thermal throttling will kick in making your phone significan notly slower display is definitely above average and one of the best features of this device just remember to turn off auto brightness because it brings more cons than pros it kills battery it dims the screen too much in certain cases etc audio is phenomenal camera is above average but it is not a camera phone no optical zoom no ois bad useless macro lens videos are nice but sometimes they stutter a bit not zoomed pictures are very good night ones too miui is a bad os too many ads even if you turn them off bad optimization nonsense features game turbo makes games slower auto brightness kills battery faster too much bloatware bad battery optimization etc 120w charging is a good and often time saving experience i am concerned about battery life though build quality is solid design is a bit generic no ip68 but the phone seems to resist well to occasional water drops splashes disappointing wi fi signal strength compared to other phones e g mi 10t placed side by side and connected to the same network and on the same band 5 or 2 4 ghz final thoughts it is an okay phone it could be a great one but too many cons are counter balancing the pros not sure i would buy it again ,1.0,POSITIVE,related to xiaomi review ,Modern,

319,1556,,,,,thanks for your review i have actually found the sd888 to run games well on max graphics and deal decently with thermals but just like you said the thermal throtthling shows when doing the stupidest task i did not know auto brightness on this device could drain more battery maybe i should just try setting a higher brightness when going outside and just leaving it like this the brightness issue is the only issue this display has for me for the rest it is fantastic yes xiaomi should have definitely put ois and optical zoom to make this a proper camera phone which are the two things i feel missing from this camera system ,2.0,POSITIVE,related to xiaomi review ,Aggressive,

324,1577,,,,,it is just an ok phone i bought the 128gb ver for dollar300 bucks yes for the price it is not bad but after one month of use battery is draining quicker everyday also the screen the overall quality seems kinda cheap the photos are not what you would expect only with good light you will get good pics to be honest i think they are better in the mia2 that being said the size it is just perfect it runs most apps smoothly works fine just keep in mind it is not a high end phone or has the price of one so in the medium range it is still an option ,17.0,POSITIVE,related to xiaomi review ,Modern,

384,1824,,,,,i see a lot of people wishing xiaomi released their phones in us but just as with huawei emui miui is heavily modded and has various annoyances my daily driver was a galaxy s6 and i needed a dual sim phone for some time and hence got a redmi 3s prime for 135dollar the hardware is fantastic snapdragon processor great fingerprint sensor and build quality and it has got a 4100mah battery the rest of the hardware is great for the price except for speaker placement at the back and volume power buttons on the same side and i press the wrong button at least once a day but the software is horrible apps do not auto start by default did not know this missed several messages on slack and whatsapp due to this most apps do not have notification permissions by default again missed notifications does not store separate settings for headphone and speaker quite a few times an incoming phone call deafened me and i forgot to increase the volume after removing headphones and missed calls due to low volume randomly lose volte connection until you delete and recreate apn overheats while in my bag no idea why reboots randomly mostly in the night and not more than once a day but annoying photos and videos do not open when i tap on them in whatsapp have to go to gallery to view them there is a constant battery drain i think it is because the phone is always on lte but i am not sure i thought i will recommend this to family but i have changed my mind moto g it is though it is more expensive and offers less specs than xiaomi if i can put cyanogenmod on this this phone will be great but i have never rooted before and i am totally confused after reading xiaomi forums i do not think there is a rom available for this now and the bootloader is locked and the process did not look straightforward edit i am using official global rom which the phone comes with since i bought the phone in india i managed to solve the apps not auto starting and notifications not appearing after changing the defaults but my point was defaults suck and it is not apparent you have to modify these settings and also how to modify i was not getting slack messages and i thought the app was misbehaving but later i noticed even whatsapp has the same problem that is when i realized the phone is screwing with the apps,21.0,POSITIVE,related to xiaomi review ,Modern,
