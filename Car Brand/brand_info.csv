ACURA,"The Japanese seem to have all the traits of engineering-passionate mythical phoenix birds descendants. After having risen from the ashes of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki Second World War nuclear bombings, the island dwellers leaped into a full-scale both intrinsic and outer reconstruction process that would later catapult them as a leading force on the international auto-market. 1986 was the year when Japanese engineers unleashed their newly formed Acura division of 4 wheeled katanas against the frail armies of western technology. Soon after the attack was initiated, early models of Acura vehicles quickly took over vast US car market shares on the road to victory. The spark triggered a mass techno-religious conversion among car buyers who quickly turned to the new Eastern alternatives - who have accurately hit the niche American builders had failed to fill: the luxury market. Acura was born as the rich child of the elder Honda father-brand and quickly became the driving force that would change customers' perception of Asian motorized artisanship. The package Acura delivered to the US after Honda had spent 10 ears of research consisted of only two models: the Legend and the Integra. The road-runner pair had enough success overseas to compel competing Asian brands into sending their own troops to the US. Thus, Toyota sent a wave of hostile novelty and improvements with their newly created luxurious Lexus brigade and Nissan joined the party by flaunting a new shiny infant-brand, the Infiniti. Although Acura had already managed to integrate the legend of better Asian automobiles into US consumer minds through the V6-powered Legend sedan and the sleek, sharp Integra, it was yet to display all of its arsenal. As soon as the 90's came, four years after the brand had reached American territory, it delivered a crushing blow to luxurious-sports car competitors: the NSX. An acronym for  a science-fueled battle cry that translated as 'New Sports eXperimental', the NSX quickly became a cheaper and fun alternative to costly European counterparts such as the ones delivered by German and Italian manufacturers like BMW and road-cruising and racing supremacists Ferrari. Not only did the NSX strike a weak spot, but it also garnered appreciation as being the first series car made entirely of aluminum. Despite its early success, Acura entered some mid 90's dark ages as a result of reported poor design choices and failure to rejuvenate the already existing line of models. By 1996, the Legend and Integra names were dropped and replaced with parsimonious alphanumeric tags as part of a new naming nomenclature that would drag the entire brand to a mild maelstrom of confusion. Subsequent model improvements and quasi-subtle Lexus design forgery plunged Acura into temporary platitude, despite its engine power upgrades to more than 200 hp on 1996's 3.5 RL - the reinvented Legend. The knockdown effect would not last for long though, as the beginning of the 21st century brought Acura to a fresh start with the introduction of several redesigned models, such as the 1999 Acura 3.2 TL, engineered as a challenger against competition's wheeler-troopers, such as the Lexus ES, Infiniti l30 and the the BMW 3-series. Despite having failed to dominate its foes, the 3.2 earned much acclaim due to its consumer attractiveness that was the result of a balanced blend of luxury, sportiness and competitive pricing. In a matter of years, Acura took on SUV territory with the MDX and continued to sustain the rise of its machines with new accomplishments and faster, better units at the exiting factory gates. In fact, Acura is currently leading a full-scale take-over, with the brand having reached Chinese markets only two years ago and plans for breaking into the former USSR compound by the end of 2008.

ALFA ROMEO,"Romeo is not only a thespian Shakespearean character but also represents part of an Italian mechanical deity, devoted to constructing automobiles at godly standards for mortal drivers. It is the Alfa without the Omega for ever since it began producing cars back in 1910, never has its activity been threatened by permanent halting. The Alfa Romeo coat of arms looks like it bears the marks of   early religious involvement with a red cross on a white background reminding of the crusades juxtaposed with a dragon headed snake that resembles the devilish creature slain by Saint George but it was actually designed by human heads with only one purpose in mind: devotion and performance. Although the firm is widely deemed as 100% Italian, its beginnings prove otherwise. The company was originally founded as Societa Anonima Italiana Darracq by French automobile industry entrepreneur Alexandre Darracq with help from Italian investors in 1906. One of the high-rollers, an aristocrat known by the name of Ugo Stella, later became chairman of the newly formed Milano- based corporate entity that would have a hard time selling cars by 1909. Ugo then took a decisive step by founding a new motor company in association with the other investors and Darracq. The ALFA, an acronym for  Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili  translated to Lombard Automobile Factory, Public Company. The early Alfas were undoubtedly some fine pieces of machinery, and helped the company succeed in making cars that appealed to the Italian market and that would later become a corner stone in auto-engineering and design. In 1915, Neapolitan Nicola Romeo – a mathematical teacher – took over the company's management during World War I and brought significant changes to the factory's assembly lines in order to comply with the high demand of military equipment at the time. Alfa Romeo has also been involved in racing, having won competitions ever since the birth of their first 24 HP model in 1910 – which entered the famous Sicilian Targa Florio competition. Soon after its fulminatory start, many victories would come on equally numerous racing tracks all over Europe. The immense success of the Alfa Romeo models throughout the upcoming 5 decades – whose image benefited greatly from their impressive performances in motor racing – did not translate into economic growth for the Italian company. Consequently, Alfa Romeo was purchased by Finmeccanica S.p.A. – a government-controlled industrial group – some 50 years later, in order to avoid bankruptcy. However, the state would not hold on to it too long and eventually gave it up (again) because of its financial difficulties. Before becoming stray and disoriented, Fiat adopted it as one of the group's subsidiaries. Alfa has been rolling with Fiat since 1986. The marque is one of the few European ones currently unavailable in the US, having halted all exports to the North American market in 1995. However, it may be planning a return to US grounds through a mutually beneficial partnership with luxury manufacturer Maserati. One of Italy’s most storied car-builders, Alfa trades on a glorious history of fast, beautiful road and race cars, at least some of which weren’t terribly unreliable. On its good days, this Turin-based manufacturer serves up fizzily exotic alternatives to the strait-laced German exec fare (hello, Giulia Quadrifoglio!). On its bad days, it serves up lightly reheated Fiats (hello, MiTo!). Hardly a reliable banker, but never, ever boring.","Sporty, Exotic, Fast, Beautiful, Racing, Performance, Italian","Sporty, Italian, Exotic, Fast, Beautiful, Racing, Performance, Devotion, Mechanical, Automobiles, Design, Alfa Romeo"
ALPINE,"Alpine is a French manufacturer of racing and sportscars that was created in 1954 by Jean Rédélé. Since its creation, the company has been close to Renault, as even its first model was based on the 4CV. That was the Alpine A106 which achieved a number of successes through the 1950s. Then the Alpine A108 came by in 1958, based on the Renault Dauphine, and played an important role in making the brand mainstream. And so, history takes us to the Alpine A110, the brand's most famous model thanks to its success in rallies throughout the 70s. Actually, thanks to the A110, the Lancia Stratos came to existance as the first car designed specifically for rally rancing to beat it. The company continued to develop its models thoughout the 80s, with the A310 being the next interpretation of the A110. This was a sportscar with a rear-mounted engine which then transformed into the new Alpine GTA range made out of plastic and polyester components. The 90s brought a special edition widebody GTA Le Mans and the all-new Alpine A610 and later on the Alpine A710 Berlinette 2. In 1995, parent company Renault gave up on the Alpine subsidiary, but then, in October 2007, it was reported that Renault's marketing coss Patrick Blain had revealed plans for several sportscars, and in 2009, the company confirmed its plans to revive the Alpine brand. In 2016, at an event in Monte Carlo, Renault unveiled the Alpine Vision showcar, thus announcing a 2017 relaunch of the brand along with a production version of the model.

ARIEL,"Ariel Ltd. is a sports car manufacturer based in Crewkerne, Somerset. It is one of United Kingdom’s smallest car makers, employing only 7 people. The company was established in 1991 as Solocrest Limited, but changed its name in 2001 to Ariel Ltd. after purchasing the name rights in 1999 from the former renown British car and motorcycle manufacturer. While they are two different entities, the meaningful Ariel name in the history of British automotive can’t be left unexplored. The name Ariel itself has its origins in Hebrew, meaning Lion of God, but it is believed the British founders took the name inspired from Shakespeare’s play ""The Tempest"", where it is the name of an air spirit. The company’s first achievement dates back to 1870 and was called the Ariel Ordinary. It was a two-speed gear, 48-inch front wheel bicycle with patented spoke tension hubs and lightweight all-steel frame. After this, during the early 1900s,  Ariel, one of the pioneering British automotive firms, introduced two quintessential roadsters. The first was a 1100 kilos two seater, named Ariel Grand Prix Racer, which was powered by a 2,325 cc 4 cylinder engine. The second was named the Hillclimber and was a four seater classic roadster with a 3,000 cc simplex engine, that developed 60 hp and had an aluminum body. Right after that Ariel abandoned the car development plans and ventured in the motorcycle domain. Throughout the first half of the 20th century Ariel has established a reputation among British motorcycle manufacturers. Among the marque’ several successful  motorcycle models we remember: the Model E Super Sports, Red Hunter, Square 4 and Arrow. Returning to the present day Ariel Ltd. the company made its name in 2000 when it introduced the world’s first exoskeletal road-going car and was named the Atom. The car had a visible frame work with a tubular chassis and received a Rover K-series engine. Because it had no bodywork or roof, the car was extremely light (approx. 1,000 lbs) and managed blistering acceleration. The Ariel Atom 2 was an improved version of the first Atom, but featured a 2.0-liter Honda VTEC engine and a Honda 6-speed manual transmission. Ariel Atom’s success soared after the Atom 2 was reviewed by the popular British automotive show Top Gear. The Ariel Atom 2 received praises for its astonishing acceleration, quality handcraft, responsive and predictable handling. The Atom achieved the world record for fastest zero to 100 mph and back to zero time for a road legal car. The best thing to come out of Somerset since the B171. Ariel built motorbikes back in the day, now makes pretty much the closest four-wheel equivalents in the shape of the track-focused Atom, and everywhere-focused Nomad. If you enjoy total driving thrills, an Ariel may be for you. If you enjoy the sensation of ‘not getting wet when it rains’, an Ariel may not be for you.","Sporty, Lightweight, Exoskeletal, Roadster, Track-focused, Thrilling, Responsive, Handcrafted","Sporty, Lightweight, Exoskeletal, Roadster, Track-focused, Thrilling, Responsive, Handcrafted"
ARTEGA,"In 2006, a mechanical engineer dreamed about making a sportscar company compete against big brands such as Porsche, Lotus, or Ferrari. That mechanical engineer was Klaus Dieter Frers, and the company he founded was Artega. His dreams looked great and, in 2007, he unveiled its intentions in the form of the Artega GT. It was a light, nimble, aerodynamic sports car that could fight well against a Porsche Cayman or a Lotus Evora. But the world financial crisis hit him hard. The dreams were turned into a nightmare when most of his customers withdrew their Artega GT orders. Eventually, in 2009, the car finally reached the assembly line. But the company was already in big debt. A Mexican investment firm, Tresalia Capital, took over the German carmaker's control and tried to save the brand and produced the ordered vehicles. Frers left the company and returned to Paragon AG.; his other company specialized in producing display systems for the automotive industry. But the problems were not over for Artega. With a new CEO on-board, Dr. Wolfgang Ziebart, former head of Continental AG (tiremaker) and Infineon AG (semiconductor manufacturer), started to produce electric vehicles. The new management saw where the market was going and tried to be one step ahead. Unfortunately for him, the business plan didn't work. Artega already had an excellent platform, the GT, and all it had to do was replace the Volkswagen-sourced V-6 engine and gearbox with an electric powertrain. The solution worked and, in 2015, the company unveiled the Artega SE, a battery-powered version for its GT sibling. Still, the sales were not as good as expected, despite the SE's performance and up to 300 km (186 miles) range. In terms of performance, it was quicker than the GT. Still, the sales were not very good, but at least now the company knew where to go next: in the mass-market segment. Artega introduced the Karo in 2015, which resembled the 1955 BMW Isetta, but with an electric powertrain instead of a gasoline engine. The carmaker had to do anything it could in order to survive, and the new electric trend could work better for it. Under the bubble-shaped bodywork was an ATV-like chassis, with the two occupants riding two-up style. In 2020, Artega announced Karo's price, which was similar to other budget electric, four-seat cars. At the same time as the Karo, the German carmaker unveiled the Scalo, which was very close to a production model. Unlike many other electric vehicles on the market, it used batteries and high-power capacitors. It was powered by two motors, one for each rear wheel, with a combined power of 300 kW. Artega used space engineering and aviation materials to build the vehicle. Its polyurethane-carbon bodywork followed the same shape as the Artega GT but with smaller air-intakes. It was more expensive than a Porsche Turbo from the same year. In 2017, Artega revived an older idea used in the famous McLaren F1 supercar of the '90s when it unveiled the Superelettra concept. Four electric motors powered the electric supercar, one for each wheel, but with three seats inside, with the driver seating in the middle, flanked by its passengers. It was an evolution from the Scalo but showed a few different ideas, such as the rear-view cameras instead of mirrors. By the time of publication, Artega didn't announce a price for it. Despite its exciting products, the Artega's fate was troubled. Its vehicles were either too expensive or too bold for the market and, without a proper dealer network and aftersales support, could not deliver more than 153 from its GT model. Its electric supercars were more expensive the Tesla's products while the delivery time was uncertain.

ASTON MARTIN,"What do you do when you have fair amounts of car racing talent, ample passion for automobiles and your enthusiasm, if converted into electricity, could power a small town? You start your own car production and sales business, of course. That is exactly how the Aston Martin brand was started, proudly born into a garage, much like grunge music. Lionel Matin and Robert Bamford garnered levels of success similar to Kurt Cobain's Nirvana. However, Martin and Bamford's version of Nirvana was engineered form scrap through a partnership that would ultimately lead to a kick in the luxury auto-market's groin. Aston Martin was founded in 1913, soon after Martin emerged victorious out of the famed Aston Hill race. The duo produced their first car 2 years later by fitting a four-cylinder Coventry-Simplex engine to a 1908 Isotta-Fraschinni chassis. However, their plans of starting production were abruptly shattered by the First World War outbreak when both of the car-makers joined the army. Still, Aston Martin would prevail as soon as the War was over, with the company being refunded to resume its activity. However, not much time went by before Bamford left Aston Martin in 1920. Luckily enough, a wealthy investor saw the true potential of the brand and poured heavy funds into its rejuvenation. Count Louis Zborowski investment turned almost overnight into a delicious technological improvement reward topped with racing track winnings whipped cream. In 1922, Aston Martin produced vehicles to compete in the French Grand Prix. Besides gaining fame by appearing at some of the most popular races of that time, the cars also collected acclaim by setting new speed and endurance records at Brooklands. The three types of chassis that were used at the time became known as the winning trio with chassis number 1915 at the top and supporting numbers 1914 and 1916 at the sides. However, the tidal wave of fame that has propelled Aston Martin to new heights broke against the solid wall of a 1924 bankruptcy. Still, it survived, having been purchased by Lady Charnwood who gave her son John Benson an important administrative role. It would ultimately prove that her son could not face the challenges of such a position and the company failed again only one year later. By 1926, the doors had slammed shut, with Lionel Martin stepping into the shoes of his former business partner, Robert Bamford. Soon after Martin's leaving, the company would be revived for a second time by a ring of rich investors including Bill Renwick and Augustus Bertelli who were responsible for the design and performance of some of the models that would later enter production. By 1937, Bertelli had already developed a variety of vehicles, some of the most famous being the 'Le Mans', the Mk II' and the 'Ulster'. Although Aston Martin was doing well, it was soon afflicted by a third set of financial problems that were deftly fixed by L. Prideaux Brune, who continued to finance the company for a short time. After changing ownership for a fourth time, the luxury car-maker became still, once the Second World War broke out. in 1947, the lethargy that had snugly wrapped around the company's activity received a coupe de grace from 'charioteer' David Brown, who had also acquired Lagonda the same year. Aston Martin Motors, who had gained the name during its 1926 resurrection, had entered a new stage of production. The first model of the DB series would soon appear, with a successor being announced in 1950, the DB3 seven years later and so on until the early 70's with the DBS V8. Although Aston Martin enjoyed success and appreciation, it switched to financial-trouble mode once more, changing two ownerships over the next two decades until Ford took over in the early 90's. During this time, Aston had grown in size and notoriety with a much wider palette of offerings ranging from the Volante to the Vantage and the DB7. Although Ford would not slacken the reigns on Aston Martin's leadership, the board committee was forced to take the same decision as Aston's previous owners: sell the company. Last year (2007) Aston Martin entered a new era when it was purchased by a Prodrive chairman David Richards-led consortium for the amount of $848 million. Ever since, Aston has registered an overall sales increase and has expanded by opening more dealers in Europe and even moving to China, a performance that hasn't been achieved in almost a century worth of car-brand history. Creator of some of the most beautiful cars in history. With a back catalogue including the entirely iconic DB5, Aston today makes a serious array of fast cars infused with just a hint of Mercedes engineering, punctuated by the occasional massive financial wobble. Favoured brand of notorious double-agent ‘James Bond’, though Aston doesn’t like to mention it too often.","Luxury, Racing, Iconic, Fast, Beautiful, Engineering, Heritage, Notorious","Luxury, Racing, Iconic, Fast, Beautiful, Engineering, Notorious, Financial Wobble"
AUDI,"Shower gels and generally beauty-product brands have a way of appealing to customers by thrusting desire through sensorial-related names and presentation of their offers. Olfactory sense-stroking balms and soothing cashmere-touch night cream-approaches are basically the most commonly used methods of conveying beauty and easy customer-access to deeply-rooted sensorial pampering, unless beauty is forged out of steel and thousands of accurately engineered parts. Automobiles undoubtedly fall into the latter category, and what better way of striking at least one of the remaining three senses if not building an image of a mighty engine roar or purr of a loyal cylinder sextet cradled under the bonnet of an Audi car? Audi translates as 'listen' from latin and besides expressing an unanimously accepted passion of the motorist, that of listening to the engine as if it were a never before heard dissertation on mechanics blended with boisterous 'deux ex machina' comments and demonstrations, it also marks the birth of Audi following Horch's demise, the previous name of the company that can be traced back to 1899. Its founder, August Horch was forced out of his own company in 1909 due to trademark infringements, 8 years after the first automobile had rolled out the gates of the plant in Zwickau, Germany. After having been dispensed of, Horch started his own company under the same name which led to a fair share of trouble that came to an end as soon as Horch called for a meeting at the apartment of Franz Fikentscher to discuss the matter and come up with a new name for the company. Franz's son who was studying latin at the time was the true deliverer of the name that would later became synonymous with luxury and quality. As 'Horch' means listen in Old German, the boy simply made a switched the name with its latin corespondent, 'audi', sparking enthusiasm into the 'audience' that quickly adopted the name. Audi's start o the German market was high lighted by the appearance of 2.6 liter engine powered vehicles followed by a series of more powerful ones, such as 4.7 L and the gas-gulping 5.7 L. Having gotten to see his company grow wings, Horch left in in 1920, four years before Audi's first 6 cylinder model was built. In 19128, Audi was acquired By Jorgen Rasmussen, owner of rival company DKW. A few years later, a merger between Audi, DKW, Horch and Wanderer occurred and thus, the Auto Union was formed in 1932. Those times called for a new badge and the four interlocked rings were born as a sign of unity and identity of the newly formed auto-conglomerate. Technological improvement became a top priority that first took shape during the Second World War when an armored car was produced for the German Army. However, all the progress would soon be severely slowed down and even halted at times due to heavy bombings. Moreover, as as soon as the conflict had come to an end, Zwickau had been caught in the soviet occupation zone that would become The German Democratic Republic in 1949. Not only that the company's activity was in jeopardy but the Auto Union had also broken up and the Union had to be restarted n new grounds, in Ingolstadt, Bavaria. Though sluggish at first, the newly Ingolstadt based factory would attract many of the former workers and the construction of two-stroke engines would be resumed in a way similar to that of Zwickau. By 1958, Daimler-Benz had already acquired a whopping 87% of the Auto Union but its investment quickly became property of Volkswagen, the company having bought the factory and  and the brands in 1964. Soon after the change of ownership, two-stroke engines would be eliminated in favor of the more popular and more customer appealing four-stroke ones. DKW, the leading brand of the Union at the time failed as a brand despite of the changes  it had made and Volkswagen decided to resurrect Audi. The former DKW built model was rebranded as an Audi one and was the springboard for the make of later models such as the 60, 75 and 80. After a second merger with the Stuttgart based car-producer NSU by 1970, Audi established itself as a reliable growing brand that would later break the German boundaries and expand to new markets, including the North American one where it encountered difficulties following the release of a biased report that portrayed the car as suffering form 'unintended acceleration'. This was caused by the close placement of the brake and acceleration pedals, right next to each other. Shortly after the report was released , an abrupt decline in sales was registered that was countered only years later with the 1996 release of the A4 model. Joining a row of successful car-producers, Audi has also garnered acclaim on the racing track with several World Record holdings, including one for Top Speed Endurance. Audi is currently enjoying a privileged position and large market share and is predicted to reach the production threshold of 1 million units by the end of this year. The business-suited branch of the Volkswagen Group. Based in Ingolstadt, Germany, Audi offers a baffling line-up of deeply professional offerings that occupy pretty much every niche the market has ever asked for, plus a few it probably hasn’t.

AURUS,"In the former U.S.S.R. ZIL was the state limousine, which was built exclusively for top-ranking members of the Russian Communist Party. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the old ZILs were used only on special occasions when the Russian president was involved. Soon, it became clear that they will have to change the old ZIL fleet, and thus, the Cortage (Motorcade) project was born. The name Aurus came from the chemical symbol of gold (Au) and Russia (Rus). The development of the new vehicle began when Marussia Motors (Russian sports carmaker) and NAMI (The State Research Center of the Russian Federation) started a design competition named ""A car for the President."" The result was an intriguing project, a mix between a classic ZIL and a Chrysler 300C, which was further refined. The Aurus Saga continued with intensive research done at NAMI to develop a new platform, allowing the construction of a sedan, a limousine, an SUV, and a minivan. These cars were meant to be used by the State Duma (Russian Parliament) and the Russian security and protection service. ZIL was not able to build the car since it stopped producing passenger vehicles for almost a decade, and ever since, they only built trucks. A new company was needed to start from scratch. With some help from Porsche, the final platform was developed, and the car's design was refined by Yuri Chernenko, Aurus' head of the design department. He stated that the vehicle's look was finished after extended researches with potential customers, while the inspiration vehicle was the 1945 ZIS-110 used for the top Russian Communist Party leaders, which was in turn inspired by Packard. To develop the new lineup, NAMI employed Vadim Pereverzev, who had previously worked at FIAT for 15 years, as a chief designer of the Aurus project. For the production, NAMI asked the Sollers factory specializing in vehicle production to set up the assembly lines for the first Aurus vehicles. The project, which started in 2013, was already closer to the final stage, and the research company focused on the limousine and the minivan more while freezing the SUV project. Also, the carmaker stated that it started to develop a crossover based on the same EMP platform used for the Senat and the Arsenal (the MPV). The work for the first vehicles continued and, in 2017, the Russian president tested a limousine. Soon after that, the Russian Federal Security Service ordered 16 vehicles. Since the serial assembly plant was not ready, NAMI started to hand-built them and, by the end of that year, it delivered 14 units. In May 2018, Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived at the inauguration in a Senat Limousine. On May 23rd, 2018, the Aurus brand was presented in Moscow and marked the Russian carmaker's birthdate. In the same year, the Tawazun company from the United Arab Emirates became the first investor in the Aurus brand, investing EUR 110 million in the project. By that time, the production location was already established at Alabuga, and at the beginning of 2019, the Aurus LLC carmaker stakeholders were announced: NAMI – 63%, Sollers – 0.5%, and Tawzun with the rest of the 35.5%. In March 2019, at the Geneva International Motor Show, Aurus unveiled the Senat S600 sedan and the L700 Limousine. The new luxury brand attracted a large crowd around them. Their size and luxury features, developed mostly by NAMI, stood apart from other cars from the show. But soon, Toyota, Michelin, and Lamborghini claimed against the brand name since it was too close to the Auris nameplate, Taurus tire brand (owned by Michelin), and the Urus (Lamborghini SUV). Later on, Lamborghini withdrew its claim. Apart from the Aurus cars, the Russian company worked on other luxury-oriented vehicles such as custom-made helicopters and even an electric motorcycle.

BENTLEY,"The definition of luxury may have nothing to do with the streets but, paradoxically, it can be seen roaming through some of the least expected places, rims glimmering, wood and chrome finished steel bulk rolling silently through concrete labyrinth passage ways. It's an automobile that goes great with yachts and French Riviera vacations as well as New Zealand wool pin stripe suits and finely designed porcelain buttons embedded in solid gold. Bentley has been a provider of quality stand-out privileged social and financial statement-vehicles since 1919. Founded by Walter Owen Bentley (1888-1971), Bentley Motors has grown into a world leading car-maker and also a symbol of Great Britain, as well as sole provider of wheels for the Queen through the 2002 released State Limousine. The company's founder had primarily been known for designing and making reliable rotary engines that were fitted on aircraft during World War I, before successfully entering the auto-world. Before becoming notorious with the Bentley BR1 aero-engine during the war, Bentley had been in partnership with his brother H.M., selling French D.F.P. cars. It was during those times that he thought of establishing his own car-making business. Soon after Bentley Motors was formed in January, 1919, the company was ""allowing"" Walter Owen to exhibit a chassis with an engine replica at the London Motor Show. The design was a success and the orders poured in. However, the company was unable to carry the deliveries out in time, with the first cars being ready for shipping only in September 1921, one year later than initially estimated. Although, it had a lot of fans and enjoyed great value on the UK market, the company suffered a fate similar to that of  Aston Martin, undergoing several ownership changes and financial trouble. Fortunately enough, its allies were constantly on the look-out and possessed vast riches that they used to keep Bentley on track. Bentley was acquired by millionaire and 'Bentley Boy' enthusiast Wolf Barnato, who became the new owner of the company in 1925. Despite the steady cash flow that was used to stop Bentley Motors from sinking, the Great Depression wiped clean any desire for expensive automobiles, leaving Bentley poor and disoriented. This time, help would come from giants from Rolls Royce, who bought the work shop in 1931. Thanks to the 'Bentley Boys', the marque managed to stay afloat and gained racing acclaim, with Barnato participating in the Le Train Bleu race (he drove in traffic from Cannes to Calais and finished first). Consequently, the model became known as the Blue Train Bentley. Moreover, further victories would be obtained by Bentley in the famous endurance race 24 hours of le Mans, the British carmaker emerging victorious for four consecutive times, between 1927 and 1930. Until entering under the Rolls Royce tutelage, Bentley fitted a variety of engines on their cars: from the classic 3L and 4.5 Blower Bentley engine to the 6L or massive 8L mechanical heart in the 30's. Before parting ways with the Rolls Royce parent company in 1998 and moving to VW grounds, Bentley had greatly improved their offers and technological improvements, especially after becoming a separate car line again during the 80's. Models such as the type R, S and Continental represented only a small fraction of what would come in the following years. Later models included the beautiful Azure convertible, the Turbos Sport R and S models and the competitive Brooklands. Starting with 1998, German carmaker VW Group took over as Bentley's parent company in a profitable partnership with BMW. The agreement between the two parts stated that VW would make both Bentley and Rolls Royce cars until 2002, when the rights to manufacture Rolls Royce vehicles would pass entirely to BMW. Until 2003, BMW was a constant supplier of engines for both car lines. Soon after BMW's withdrawal, the company launched a new model that would become even more popular than the Azure: the Continental GT. In fact, demands were so numerous that Bentley was reacquainted with the situation form the 20's, when it was unable to meet demands. The latest models from the British carmaker include the 2005 Continental Flying Spur saloon, the 2006 Azure convertible and it's Continental GT counterpart, and the 2008 Brooklands and GT Speed Coupe. British-based maker of very luxurious, very heavy automobiles. Founded in 1919, Bentley founded its reputation on a string of Le Mans 24 Hour wins in the Roaring Twenties.

BMW,"Contrary to some opinions, BMW does not stand for Best Motors in the World company. Sure, BMW-branded automobiles are regarded as being some of the few engineering forms close to perfection, but the letters stand for something less boisterous and more good-natured: Bayerische Motoren Werke or Bavarian Motor Works. The secret to their success does not lie in precise astrological predictions or mischievous and blatant employ of corporate espionage, but rather in a dedication to quality and constant pursuit of excellence. Unlike most of the auto manufacturers out there, BMW hasn't focused on a vehicle as a whole but started from its primary source of power, the engine, which has been perfected by generations of engineers over a close-to-a-century time span. The 'cardio-approach' BMW took resulted into obscenely efficient performance-happy engines that literally rocketed the company formed by Karl Friedrich Rapp in October 1913 straight to the sky. Rapp's company, 'Rapp-Motorenwerke' - that would later become BMW - focused mainly on aircraft engines due to the large demand at the time, fueled by the imminence of Wold War I. Despite the need for aircraft engines, Rapp failed to sale his powerplants due to a reliability flaw caused by unwanted engine vibrations. However, his neighbor Gustav Otto, who was also the owner of an aircraft engine plant, enjoyed a great deal of success. Struggles to keep 'Rapp-Motorwerke' afloat failed and, by 1916, Karl Rapp resigned under the weight of the financial difficulties that had been pressing against the factory's lungs for a few years. As in the case of other car brands, such as Bentley or Aston Martin, expected and highly predicable 'Hollywoodian' rescuers came along and fended off the threats. Austrian triumvirate formed by new company owners Franz-Josef Popp and financier Camillo Castiglioni relaunched the Motoren Werke by persuading Gustav Otto into a merger that would prove mutually beneficial. Thus, the 'Bayerische Flugzeug-Werke' or BFW was formed. Shortly after the new entity was born, its name turned into the murmur of what would later become a shout-out for quality automobiles: BMW. By the time the 20's came with the Charleston and its afferent bizarre fashion sense, BMW had already developed a range of highly-appreciated airplane engines that had garnered tons of acclaim - especially after the 1918-improved Type IIIA engine successfully powered a biplane to the impressive height of 16,404 feet in a mere 29 minutes. The beginning of the 20's also happily slapped BMW with its still unchanged to this day logo, mimicking the motion of a white propeller on a sky-blue background. While enjoying the heights of an appreciated and sought for brand, BMW was brutally pulled back to earthy existence once the World War was over. The Treaty of Versailles prohibited BMW from continuing its activity and the company switched to manufacturing air brakes for railway cars. Forced by the Versailles-imposed conditions, the company found itself searching for other alternatives and soon enough came to focus on developing motorcycle engines. Over a two-year period of time (from 1920 to 1922), BMW built two motorcycle models, the Victoria and the Flink. Their success was consequently marked by the building of the first BMW factory, that would further kick the brand to new heights. Although BMW motorcycles encountered sales problems due to defective suspension, the company still managed to hold a constant leading position in aeronautical engineering. By 1927 the company was the proud  holder of just over one third of the aviation records of those time, with an astonishing 29 out of an overall 87. Two-wheeled vehicles quickly turned into four-wheeled ones in 1928, when the Austin license-built Dixi 3/15 rolled out the factory doors. Only one year later, BMW made the headlines once again, this time by setting a new motorcycle-speed record through their Ernst Henne ridden 750 cc bike, that reached the speed of 134.65 mph (216.75 km/h). Swinging from breaking world records to engineering innovations, BMW hit the bull's eye once more in 1932, with the launch of their new car model, the 3/20 PS. The 782 cc 4 cylinder powered car was the first one independently produced by BMW. Shortly after the waves of acclaim generated by the new machine, the company announces its next model, the 303 saloon, that would bring a persistent trait in all future BMW engine configurations: the 6 cylinder one. Only years after the launch of the 303 in 1933, BMW continued its world record breaking streak, at the same time with the beginning of a new chapter in its cylinder-powered existence: the development of the company's first roadster, the 328 model (1936), and a row of motor sport wins over the following two years. As time passed by, BMW got bigger and bigger and, shortly before the Wold War II outbreak, took over some more factories in the vicinity of Berlin. More motor sport wins were to follow, with Baron Fritz Huschke von Kanstein winning the Mille Miglia race in 1940s. Needless to mention, war necessities threw the company into military equipment production policies once more. Despite the lengthy world conflict, BMW developed some of its greatest pieces of machinery, such as the R57 Wehrmacht military motorcycle, as well as the 109-300 jet engine which was one of the first jet engines in the world to enter mass production. After recovering from the 1944 bombings that heavily damaged their plant in Munich, BMW received permission to repair Allied army motorized equipment at their plant in Allach. Due to BMW's versatility and need for mechanized faming implements and spare parts, the first BMW bicycle was born. Soon after the genesis of the leg-powered two-wheeled vehicle, BMW received a hard blow from the US army, that had ordered the dismantling of the Munich and Allach plants. After a 5-year absence from the Germany industry, BMW returned in style. Crossing the ocean all the way to New York, BMW debuted their first motorcycle in almost 2 decades - following their last one at the beginning of the 40's. More success awaited in the line for BMW, as their R68 motorcycle model developed in the 50's quickly became a standard-setter among international motorcycle manufacturers. Meanwhile a previous model, the  R67/2, reached the 100,000 threshold in 1953. BMW receives further acclaims in the years to come, as it establishes itself as an engineering force to be reckoned with. The 1955 Isetta, powered by a 12/13 hp motorcycle engine, becomes a favorite among customers. The result? Over 160,000 units are sold, transforming the Isetta into a symbol of the post-war decade. Besides coming up with newer models and bending technological improvements on their cars, BMW also held a privileged position among race winners around the world. After the development of the 507 and 600 models, BMW unleashed a shout of childish joy, grabbing an impressive win in the 1958 Austrian GP, through Ernst Hiller. With the help of Herbert Quandt, BMW, still a share-owned company, is brought one step closer to independence. Exterior offers of selling or fusion were turned down despite the enormous profits such a transaction would have led to. The 700 model entered the production lines, together with the R69, BMW's top motorcycle line-up model. The 60's brought a multitude of achievements with the 1500 and 1600 series, as well as a range of new sedans, the 2500, 2800, American Bavaria and the 2.5 CS and 2800 CS coupe models. BMW proved once more that it hasn't left its king-of-the-hill-of-racing spot, as Austrian racing driver Dieter Quester scored several victories in the Formula Two series (as well as a triple European touring car champion title in 1968, 1969 and 1977). However, BMW did not stop there. After having bestowed a great deal of mechanics magic upon the world, the company resumed its entertainment through development and unveiled the 2002 Turbo model in 1973. Following the success of its earlier aircraft engine, the 2002 Turbo is one of the first ever turbos to enter mass-production. Production lines that would become worldwide pieces of success soon came out, such as the 6 and 7 series and the recently reconstructed BMW M1 model. By the end of the 70's, BMW had dug deep into other car-improvement related fields as well, and electronics proved to be the perfect ground for growing BMW's next generation of computerized car devices. Economic fuel research then became top priority. Not only the company was quick in adapting to the fast-moving tendencies of those times, but it also became a steady and reliable supplier of armored cars for different private and public clients. Racing never lost its fans, consequently BMW never lost enthusiasm in racing. The 80's marked (finally) BMW's involvement in Formula One racing. It was in 1983 that BMW was handed its first title in the series, with Brazilian driver Nelson Piquet becoming king of the Formula One World Racing Championship. At the same time, the 5 series entered a new enhancement stage and was gifted the 518i engine and the powerful M535i. 'M' set a new standard in power and stamina. The M5 and M3 models launched in 1985 and 1986 consequently joined the pinnacle of engineering accuracy and true power and beauty among sports cars enthusiasts. Research started to be heavily reinforced and reached new uncharted areas through the employment of over 6,000 people. Once the Z1 one came along, the profits kept pile-up trend. Caring for the customer and staying ahead of competition was proof enough that BMW had turned into a true, mature brand. Expansion was inevitable and much like a Big Bang, BMW spreads across the world and inaugurated a new car plant in the US, namely in Spartanburg, South Carolina. The models that were in production at the time slowly received touring versions, which helped BMW cover an even larger slice of the market. BMW would later reveal the Z8, a successor of the 507, who later made it to the movies. The world wasn't enough and so were BMW's achievements in their own vision. Since 1999, they have been constantly delivering performance vehicles or 'motorized attire' for their wealthy customers out there. Racing has remained a pleasurable and profitable hobby for the German marque, which emerged victorious in three consecutive FIA WTCC seasons from 2005 to 2007. Only recently, BMW engineers and designers paid homage to the M1 through a modern day replica of the sharp-angled 70's original. Sadly enough, the M1 will not be revived through mass production. Stands for ‘Bayerische Motoren Werke’, but you knew that already right? Pretty much invented the super-saloon in the shape of the BMW M3, but now has to deal with Audi and Mercedes muscling in its patch. Recent years have seen BMW hiding some impressive engineering behind some increasingly concerning front grilles, with some smart electric offerings too.","Engineering, Perfection, Efficiency, Innovation, Racing, Expansion, Performance, Luxury, Electric, Design","Engineering, Perfection, Efficiency, Innovation, Racing, Expansion, Performance, Luxury, Electric, Design"
BUFORI,"Some people believe car designed peaked in the 30s, while others are addicted to the latest technology and can't imagine a world without ABS. Bufori Motor Car Company was established in order to offer both. Bufori is an acronym for Beatuful Unique Funtastic Original Romantic Irresistible. The private company specializes in making classic cars and was established by three Australian Lebanese brothers Anthony, George and Gerry Khouri. Their cars are actually built only upon order in Kepong, a suburb of Kuala Lumpur, in Malaysia.

BUGATTI,"What's the difference between Bugatti and other automobile brands? Unlike his competitors, Ettore Bugatti did not design and build his cars, he ""gave birth"" to them. His ideas sprouted into a myriad of projects that would later outrun some of the best known automobiles on Europe's racing tracks. The story of Bugatti is not that of a company that had to face countless financial problems, nor that of a company that spread all over the world by establishing sales venues or building plants across the Atlantic; the story of Bugatti is the tale of a rebellious visionary, of a young genius who could trace his origins back to a row of artists and artisans. Born in Milano, Italy, 1881, Ettore was the son of Carlo Bugatti who not only worked as a painter but also as a silversmith, sculptor and wood carver. Still in his adolescence, Ettore was sent to study sculpture at the Brera Art Academy, but quite soon after that he discovered his passion for automobiles. Following his decision of becoming an engineer at the age of only seventeen, young Ettore started working and in only one year, he had designed and built a three-wheeled vehicle powered by two engines. Despite its small size, Ettore's prototype almost wiped clean the prizes thrown in at the local races, having won an amazing 8 out of 10 events. Fueled by his tricycle's success, an enthusiast Ettore entered his 'baby' in the Paris-to-Bordeaux. The buggy came in third. Ecstatic with the result, Ettore returned to Milano determined to continue building cars. By the age of nineteen, Ettore Bugatti had just completed building his first real car. Deeming the overall technological development at the time - it was the beginning of the 1900's - his automobile seemed almost futuristic. The auto featured a four speed gearbox, a four-cylinder overhead-valve engine and a variety of engineering improvements that only a gifted builder could have come up with. From that point on, his dream took off and evolved into a very profitable business, with lots of orders coming in. Soon enough, Ettore would raise enough money to buy his own establishment. In 1909, receiving financial support from banker de Vizcaya, he purchased a large property in Molsheim, on the German territory of Alsace. Soon after his newly acquired factory, Ettore decided to go a step further and built a small, lightweight racing machine to compete in the Le Mans race. Although it looked like a four wheeled dwarf as compared to its giant competitors' cars such as a Fiat, De Dietrich and others, the little but swift and powerful automobile came in second proving that Ettore was a more talented car designer as compared to many of the older engineers at the time. The year was 1911. Three years later, the war came and Ettore, much like the majority of car builders, had to redistribute his attention to the much needed aircraft engines. As soon as the war was over, Ettore resumed his work and soon became a 'baron' leading a baroque lifestyle that earned him the title of 'Le Patron'. In 1922, Bugatti introduced a revolutionary car shaped like a cigar (Type 29/30) which featured hydraulic brakes and the manufacturer's first eight-cylinder engine. Dubbed ""the Cigar"" the car made its debut at the AFC grand prix in 1922 and took second place. One year later, Bugatti introduced the Type 32 which caused sensation due to its wing-like design, short wheelbase and covered wheels. The Type 32 was dubbed ""the Tank"" and boasted a redeveloped version of the previous 8-cylinder engine. In 1924 Bugatti entered the Type 35 in the French Grand Prix held in Lyon. While the car's design turned to its time's traditional open-wheels design, the Type 35 retained the previous 8-cylinder engine and steadily became the car to beat for the next decade. Ettore Bugatti finally realized his dream of creating the most automobile of all time in 1926 when he introduced the Type 41 Royale. This was actually the most expensive car to build, with a relative price that still surpasses anything produced since. However, with the Great Depression just around the corner, the Type 41 Royale also proved to be one of Bugatti's greatest financial threats. Sales of the Royale reached only 3 units. In 1931 the global economic crisis reached French shores, and Bugatti received a great financial help in the form of a government contract to built a high-speed train. And that is how the Autorail was born, a train using the huge engine from a Type 41 Royale, which held the world speed record for railed vehicles with combustion engines. Bugatti's last great victory in motorsport happened in 1939, when at his son's request, the company prepared a supercharged Type 57 which won at Le Mans, driven by Pierre Wimille and Pierre Veyron. Unfortunately that very same year on August 11, his only son Jean died in a testing run of the same Type 57 car. Only a few days later World War II broke out. After the war, several attempts to revive production were made, but to no distinctive result. In 1947 on August 21, Ettore Bugatti died at age 66 of pneumonia in a military hospital in Paris. After that, the brand's heritage continued in the form of several unfruitful partnerships. The aircraft company Hispano Suiza bought Bugatti in 1963 and in 1987 entrepreneur Romano Artioli purchased the rights to the Bugatti name and  built a new factory in Campogalliano, Italy, to manufacture a new super car. In 1991 Bugatti unveiled the EB 110 supercar in Paris, celebrating the 110th anniversary of Bugatti Ettore's birth. In autumn 1995, Bugatti Automobili S.p.A files for bankruptcy and three years later German car maker Volkswagen, takes over the company in an effort to revive the sports luxury brand. During the 2001 Frankfurt Motor Show, Bugatti unveils the EB 16.4 Veyron model, with a 16-cylinder and four-turbo engine. In September 2005, the production of the Veyron 16.4 begins. The car receives several media praises and establishes itself as the most expensive contemporary production car while also holding the fastest production car title for 2 years, with a homologated top speed of 408.47 km/h (253.81 mph). French maker of cheap and cheerful city runab—nah just kidding, it’s Bugatti. Creator of the Veyron and the Chiron, this aristocratic branch of the Volkswagen Group can justifiably claim to build the fastest cars in the world. If you want to experience the awesome power of a Bugatti, you’ll need (a) a decent Euromillions win and (b) a very large and empty airfield to get anywhere near the limits of its performance.","Visionary, Revolutionary, Aristocratic, Fastest, Luxurious","Visionary, Revolutionary, Aristocratic, Fastest, Luxurious"
BUICK,"Before becoming a trademark of automobile luxury and innovative engineering, Buick was rather fond of plumbing inventions. Born in Arbroath, Scotland, David Dunbar Buick experienced a second-coming to life in his mid 30's when he became particularly interested in gasoline engines. He soon discarded his plumbing-related activities and, by the 1900's, he had already built an impressive number of engines for farming and boating usage. Buick's passion for motors led him to establishing his own company, called Auto-Vim and Power Co. However, this choice of name lacked the powerful resonance of its founder's name, which was quick to replace it by 1903 - when the company pinned a brand new name tag to its chest: the Buick Manufacturing Co. During the same year, the company's heads went for further simplifying the name by dropping the 'Manufacturing' from the label. Once corporate identity and appearance issues were satisfactory solved, Buick started focusing on car-engine development. The emphasis Buick put on his work would soon pay back, the genesis of the overhead valve engine having brought the company a generous amount of acclaim. This was mostly thanks to the positioning of the valves, which allowed Buick engines to be fitted into tighter spaces while granting drivers easy access to maintenance - unlike the majority of the car engines at the time (which sported angle-mounted valves). Although Buick and his top engineering duo, Eugene Richard and Walter L. Marr, were successful in avoiding some major engine-building related intricacies, the brand entered a stage of slow-sales paradox. Such were the financial difficulties encountered that, by September 1903, David Buick and his financial backer Benjamin Briscoe Jr. sold the firm to a wagon-making group in Flint, Michigan, 60 miles from Detroit (the former headquarters of the Buick factory). Luckily, the Buick plant was moved entirely to Flint, which allowed David Buick, who had been kept as manager, to further focus on his work. Despite the 1904 construction of the first Flint Buick, the Model B, the by now one-year old Flint-Buick merger was inches away from hitting against the bulk of a metaphorical harassing Mr. Financial Trouble. And it did. The impact left the company with no other alternative than to seek help. James H. Whiting, manager of the Flint Wagon Works, approached William C. “Billy” Durant, Flint-carriage king and future GM boss, on the company's status. Durant's nose for business as well as his uncanny intuition and promotional skills would later drag Buick from the pits of tar it had fallen into, straight to flashy auto-show glamour, inked front page wows and racing domination. Although Durant was not a big automobile fan, he immediately recognized the sales-potential of the Buicks. It was the torque and rugged suspension of the cars Buick had built so far that convinced Durant that he had struck gold. Thanks to the easiness and sturdiness Buicks proved in hill climbing and muddy terrain, Durant ordered a staggering 1000 units before the company had reached the 40 threshold. Though a series of production increase oriented moves, such as the construction of a new Flint-based plant and a partnership with Charles Stewart Mott (axle supplier and future GM head), Durant saved Buick from near extinction. Durant didn't settle for just ensuring the success of the Buick brand and went farther to conquer racing grounds as well. His team, formed of Louis Chevrolet and Wild Bob Burman (among others), snatched a total of 500 trophies only between 1908 and 1910. The reason to why Buick had so much success was that by 1908 it had become the country's leading automobile producer with 8,820 cars produced. As if this wasn't enough, the new model 10 had topped all the other company's sales, with 4,002 units produced. The success registered by the Buick name grew enough to provide Durant with the grounds for spawning a large holding company. Thus, General Motors was born. When the 20's came, Buick was numbly bathing in refreshing popularity as it had become the top choice car brand for world leaders. In breaks between garnering acclaim, Buick was busy crossing finish lines and popping champagnes from the height of first-place racing podiums across the world. In fact, Buick had virtually conquered the world, with automobiles having taken part in major expeditions and crossings, such as the Lowel Thomas-led first motorized trip into Afghanistan, 1923. However, the end of the 20's brought along not-so-great news, as the Great Depression swept the country, destroying lots of companies in the process. Buick was able to withstand the fund-consuming Depression, having displayed a range of fully rejuvenated models sporting performance Dynaflow automatic transmissions, aircraft inspired portholes, or Ventiports, and renewed style elements such as flashy vertical grilles and meticulously executed finishing touches. With its growth uninterrupted, Buick continued to hold its position as the all-leading American car producer throughout the 90's with an emphasis on sedans. The Y2K year inoculated a fresh take on the car with Buick extending its activity in developing new convertible and crossover concepts. The reshaping process undergone by Buick has left the company focusing on a new range of automobiles, currently flaunting the three premium LaCrosse, Lucerne and Enclave models.

CADILLAC,"Cadillac's history can be traced back to the beginning of the 18th century. Although coaches, horse riding or walking were the favorite means of locomotion during those times and no cars had been yet made, it's important to trace the brand to its origins. The genesis of Cadillac as it is widely known today began in 1701, when a group of French explorers led by Le Sieur Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac traveled to the northern parts of the US and established Ville d'Etroit. The settling would ultimately come to be known as Detroit, a flourishing industrial city, teeming with car plants and foundries. However, Sir Cadillac would not have any connection to the future of the Cadillac car workshops. Its actual beginnings can be traced to the mid 19th century, when a boy named Henry Martyn Leland was born. Leland grew up on a farm near Barton, Vermont, where he received a solid working-education that taught him the importance of doing a job properly, regardless of its importance. The farm-training he received, combined with his penchant for improving working methods, led to his growth as an engineer. However, Cadillac would not yet emerge as an automobile brand. By 1890, Leland had founded his own company in partnership with Robert C. Faulconer and Norton, after having convinced the former of the city's need for machine shops. The company's area of expertise was gear grinding and the development of special tools. Soon after the company received general credit for the quality of the products it marketed and Leland had asserted himself as a talented engineer, the shift from steam-powered vehicles to gasoline-powered ones was made. Following the work of the visionary Daimler and Benz in Europe, a man named Ransom Eli Olds from Michigan teamed up with a group of investors under a firm called Olds Gasoline Engine Works. Their main objective was to  build a gasoline-powered engine to be fitted on the chassis of a vehicle. The project was a success but the resulting product was flawed: the gears in the transmission were too loud. Olds turned to Leland and Faulconer for help. The two entered a straight competition against the Dodge brothers who were also supplying engines for Olds. Although Leland's ultimately developed 10.25 Hp engine was better than that of Dodge, Olds turned it down due to the high car sales his company registered at the time. Basically, there was no need for a new engine. Still, Leland's engine would soon come to use. Shortly after Olds' refusal of using the newly designed engine, Leland was looked up by two men concerning the liquidation of a company that had previously built cars. Its name was the Detroit Automobile Company and had been initially reorganized by Henry Ford, who left shortly after the company began crumbling again. Leland persuaded the investors to stay in business, convincing them of the utility and importance of the automobile industry in the near future. With an engine already designed, Leland and Faulconer were brought in and the company adopted the name of Cadillac, that of the explorer that had founded the city over two centuries ago. The Cadillac coat of arms was adopted as the company's new logo and the baby-firm would still receive international recognition for its automobiles. Leland's engines had already garnered appreciation and were some of the most accurately built units of the time. In fact, not only the engines were reliable and built with pinpoint precision, but they were also highly versatile, successfully catering for the need of interchangeability. This feature has earned Cadillac the Dewer Trophy, being the first time when such an award was handed to an American automobile manufacturer. Later on, Cadillac would be part of a larger entity, the General Motors company, then run by William Crapo Durant - who paid $4.5M in cash for Leland's company to merge with GM. From that point on, several models would be developed and enter production by Leland's departure in 1917. The Brougham, Fleetwood, Deville and the Eldorado are some of the most famous models build by the GM's prodigious branch. Its accomplishments vary from speed breaking records on American territory to engineering improvements that were a premiere for the automotive world. For example, Cadillac introduced the revolutionary electrical lighting and ignition Delco system as standard equipment on their cars, as well as boasting the world's first independent front suspension on its entire line of automobiles in 1934. Closed cooling systems, electronic injection systems and catalytic converters are also among the long list of first-to-have-done things introduced by Cadillac in the US. Despite the low reception of the brand in Europe, Cadillac remains one of the great classics overseas, still boasting a privileged status among American car producers. After all, it's a brand deeply rooted in nobility grounds. Think ‘Cadillac’ and you’ll probably picture some vast slice of Fifties Americana, replete with tailfins and quite possibly painted pink. Over the years, Caddy’s occasional forays into the UK haven’t quite lived up to this redolent image. Still huge in the States but, like a ripe Brie, the Cadillac badge doesn’t seem to travel especially well.","Classic, Noble, Iconic, Prestigious, Luxurious","Classic, Noble, Iconic, Prestigious, Luxurious"
CATERHAM,"Caterham's history is tightly related to that of Lotus, as the first evolved from the former. In 1957 Colin Chapman, founder of British sports car manufacturer, Lotus, launched at that time's London Motor Show the Lotus 7 model. This was the design of an open-top lightweight sports car that registered great success in Britain due to its affordable price and race-like nimble handling. The car turned into a hit and Colin Chapman continued work on Lotus' 7 sports car project. In 1959 Graham Nearn’s Caterham Car Services was appointed a Lotus 7 dealer and in 1960 the Lotus 7 Series 2 was released. The car retained its original design and concept, as all future Caterhams will too, and featured in the 1967 TV series ""The Prisoner"". This brought a general attention to the 7 sports car and soon after many different car makers strated using the Lotus 7 platform for other variants of the sports car. 1968 saw the release of the Series 3 and in 1970 the Series 4 was unveiled. In 1973 when Lotus announced they will cease production of the 7 model, Graham Nearn purchased the rights for the car and continued production of the Series 4. However, because of its less popular impact, the new company named Caterham switched to the Series 3 production. In 1984 the company released its first Starter Kit, meat for people who wanted to build the car themselves and save money. The idea proved a successful one, at least in the United Kingdom, where the Caterham 7 cars can be bought as a CKD, complete kit to be built by owner, to this day. In 1987 the production and administration of the company moved from the town of Caterham, Surrey to a new factory in Dartford, Kent, UK. In 1989 the company built a Prisoner special edition Caterham, while in 1992 the car set a new record for a production vehicle 0-100-0 time with a 250 hp 2.0-liter Vauxhall engine. Caterham did come up with a covered model in 1994, which was the 21 roadster. Although the car received favorable reviews form the British auto magazines and had an interior finish and built quality exceeding the Lotus’ and even TVRs of the mid 90s, Caterham abandoned the project and returned to its Series 3 chassis. Only 48 Caterham 21 model cars were ever built, making them future exclusive collectibles. In 1993 the six-speed manual gearbox was introduced along with the ""7"" grille that became present on each model ever since. In 2005 the Nearn family sold the company that is now led by a new management team led by Ansar Ali, formerly of Lotus. If it ain’t broke, why fix it? From its humble base in, um, Caterham (what are the chances?) this tiny British company continues to squeeze yet more performance from the original Seven concept cooked up by Lotus founder Colin Chapman in the Fifties.","Lightweight, Nimble, Exclusive, Performance, Retro, Classic","Lightweight, Nimble, Exclusive, Performance, Retro, Classic"
CHEVROLET,"Chevrolet is the auto equivalent of a gene-boosted steroid-pumped feline. The ferocious cat was groomed by Swiss born racing driver Louis Chevrolet and business whiz Buick resurrector and former GM head William Durant, as a joint venture that started in 1910. Shortly after Durant was forced out of GM, he partnered with Chevrolet, whom he had previously employed at his Buick racing team, to regain the popularity he had lost. The Chevy headquarters was set in Detroit and the newly formed brand was baptized, receiving its famous “bowtie” logo in 1913. There are several hypotheses as to how the logo design came to be, two of them being the closest to unanimous acceptance. One of the theories hints at the logo having been designed after a poster Durant had seen in a French hotel while the second claims the “bowtie” is actually a stylized representation of the Swiss flag cross. No matter how it originated, the golden Chevy logo persisted. In fact, the brand grew at such a fast pace that it allowed Durant to regain ownership of GM in 1916. After having become wealthy enough, Durant bought a smashing 54.5 percent of GM's shares, reinstating himself as head of the auto empire. Soon after the takeover, Chevrolet was absorbed into GM, becoming a separate division. Having gained even more strength after the merger, the newly formed entity was quick in starting off production and launched the model D in 1918. The V8 35 hp engines fitted on these cars were replaced by smaller 6 cylinder ones, that proved particularly successful on commercial vehicles. The engine gained reputation due to its high durability and earned the “cast iron wonder” nickname. Only a few years later, Chevy revealed the SUV in its archaic form: the Suburban Carryall. Sporting rough terrain riding capabilities, seating for 8 and weighing around 1½ tons, it marked the beginning of Chevy's future SUV line-up. The American producer continued its successful innovations streak by introducing the Powerglide transmission in 1950, becoming the first low-price competitor to equip its vehicles with automatic shifting. Shortly after the introduction of the fully automatic transmission, the legendary Corvette was born. The Vette had such a good reception that it remained the longest running Chevy model in the brand's history, having also been the first American sports car to enter mass production. The Vette also premiered the usage of lightweight construction materials for the car's body, like plastic, at that time. Following the acclaim garnered by the Vette's release, Chevy launched several other models, including the flashy Impala and the short lived air-cooled Corvair. During the 60's, Chevy reached its sales peak with 3 cars out of any 10 sold in the US. However, before such a performance was achieved, Chevy designed a new small-block V8 engine used to equip its '55 truck range. This particular engine made it till today, going through plenty of modifications in the process ranging from lightweight, durable aluminum construction to ECU managed control and modern fuel injection for better dosage and increased power. Although Chevy has been registering lower sales in the past few years due to uncontrolled brand extension, some of the “bowtie” emblazoned automobiles have become either cult classics or vintage collectibles, four wheeled icons as reminders of a past age of glory. From a British perspective at least, a frankly confusing pillar of the GM empire, spanning – at one end – the legendary Corvette muscle car, and, at the other, a selection of cheap Korean offerings shorn of their Daewoo badges. No longer officially on sale in the UK, though Chevy will doubtless have another shot at ‘cracking Britain’ soon.","Sporty, Flashy, Iconic, Vintage, Innovative","Sporty, Flashy, Iconic, Vintage, Innovative"
CHRYSLER,"In terms of genesis, Chrysler is almost synonymous with an unwanted premature detonation. Amidst the depression of 1921 and the great collapse of 1929, when most car producers were facing extinction due to drastic decrease in sales, lack of resources and investors, a small company would try to make its way to the auto shows and into the American citizens' garages. Despite the economic meltdown that drove investors away and locked-down companies faster than a second Ice Age, the US auto market was mainly divided among two powers: the ever expanding GM and Ford. The sum of such horrific conditions would have normally drove away contenders, but Walter P. Chrysler thought otherwise. Determined to get an equally slice of the market share pizza for himself, he exhibited a handsome car at the 1924 New York Auto Show. The automobile was none other than the Chrysler 70, the model that would drag the Chrysler name to he Pantheon of American car builders. However, Chrysler wasn't born as Chrysler (from the company's standpoint). Facing a rapid and possibly permanent dissolution, the two initial companies held by Walter P., Maxwell and Chambers, merged to form a new entity that would later rub shoulders with its competitors at the time. The 70 model had an instant success that allowed the newly formed corporation to expand freely, unabated by the competition's efforts and much wider rage of automobiles. The Chambers name was dropped, whist Maxwell was re-branded as a Plymouth. By 1931, the Plymouth brand had already become a fierce competitor in the small car segment and was insistently knocking on Ford stronghold's door, yelling to make room or evict the place. Although Ford was basically partying due to the high sales registered by their model A, the more advanced Plymouth did far better. Sporting hydraulic brakes, more flowing body lines and  a “floating power”engine, the Plymouth cast an awfully large cloud of doubt over Ford's headquarters. The improvements brought by the Plymouth became so popular that other producers started using them as well. Citroen would later use Chrysler's patented “floating engine” technology that had the great advantage of reducing engine vibrations through the use of three rubber mounts that separated the engine from having direct contact with the chassis. Chrysler did so good the following years that by the end of the 30's it had already surpassed Ford and moved to a comfortable second position. Almost unknowingly, Chrysler became a titan. The time to wrestle the no. 1 car manufacturer was near and Chrysler carefully readied its match. However, what was designed as a model of crushing beauty was not well received by the American public. The 1934 Airflow model, a gorgeous curvy sparkling beauty failed to make an impact and consequently sales dropped faster than CBS dropped “The Will”. Funnily enough, the public was not touched by a car that was way ahead of its time, at least as far as the bodywork was concerned. However, poor sales were efficiently countered once Chrysler released the Imperial model. Large, powerful and luxurious, it was an instant hit and catered for the need of a stand-out motorized social status statement, as well as a reliable day to day ride. As soon as World War II was over Chrysler had entered a sales numbness, focusing more on research and engineering improvements rather than holding the company's position as a top car industry leader. The post WW II days brought along some significant changes in auto design and shape, with a legendary tail fin craze initiated by Ford and GM. In response to the existing trends, Chrysler's automobiles became longer and wider and sacrificed performance and reliability for looks. This happened because of a shift in the consumers' perspective who came to prefer style and exterior features over practicality and quality. The by know well established Chrysler products were removed to make way for a new range of flashy cars that failed to climb to the height of the precedent line-up. In doing so, Chrysler was pushed back to the third place once more. By the beginning of the 60's, Chrysler made a comeback with the introduction of the spectacularly enduring, fast and well balanced 300-F. Though some drivers complained about the vehicle's great size, its performance was hard if not impossible to contest. The machine could develop 400 hp and its acceleration was phenomenal. Once the modern times arrived, Chrysler proved its versatility and changed once with the automotive industry, delivering quality vehicles for an ever increasing mass of enthusiasts. Models such as the Sebring, 300M, 300C and PT Cruiser, a vehicle conceived as a blend of modern technology and retro style elements, managed to keep Chrysler among the top choices within US borders. Unlike other American car brands, such as Cadillac, Buick or Lincoln, Chrysler has received a great deal of attention overseas as well. During the 90's, the company merged with Daimler-Benz AG and formed Daimler Chrysler, which is currently a world leader in transportation.

CITROEN,"Although punk was still far from emerging in the 19th century, Andre Citroen would have probably liked it. The founder of the famous avant-garde French car workshops shared a lot of the attitude that the punk-wave brought forward much later: he was a revolutionary. As US-based punk group Antiflag raised 'A New Kind of Army' with the release of one of their discs, so did Citroen within the automotive industry. Born in 1878, Andre Citroen was the son of a wealthy diamond Dutch merchant. Upon completing his high-school years, young Andre had already become charmed by technology, a passion that he had first felt at the age of 10 when he discovered the writings of Jules Verne. At the age of 20, he enrolled at the Polytechnical school in Paris, having fully embraced the idea of becoming an engineer. The years of study paid off and, after having worked for a time with the car company 'Mors', he moved forward to establishing his own company. 'Andre Citroen&Cie' was founded in 1905. Andre was only 27 at the time. By 1913 the company had changed its name into 'Societe des Engrenages Citroen' (Citroen Cog Factory). The same year the visionary engineer founded another company mainly focused on developing carburetors based on a patent he had earlier obtained. Fascinated by the working methods of Henry Hord, he paid a visit to his assembly lines in the US, where he carefully analyzed the logical steps that had been taken in organizing such a working place. Having seen the process and being fueled by his own desire of making cars, Citroen would deliver his first automobile in 1919, shortly after the end of World War I. Having shared a fate similar to other car builders, Citroen had to covert its assembly lines to cate for the need of arms and ammunition during wartime. It was during this period that he started thinking about the things that he would do after the war will have been over. The first car produced by his factory was simply named Type A, a vehicle powered by a 4-cylinder 1326 cc engine that could propel the car to a speed of 40.4 mph (65 km/h). The main advantage of the model A was its versatility as, except its chassis and engine, everything was custom made or could be chosen directly from the factory out of a wide range of options, including body types and spare wheels. Another great thing about the model A was its affordable price. These two juxtaposed traits led to an overall positive reception of the vehicle. In only 6 months after its release the Type A sold 2,500 units. By next year, 1920, Citroen had already produced almost 10 times more cars. 1920 brought along a series of technological improvements, many of which would later become labels of the Citroen marque. Having paid interest to the area of road-building vehicles and military equipment, Citroen experimented with the half-tracks which he called 'Autochenilles'. By 1921 Citroen had gained enough popularity to become an element of the Parisian lifestyle. The first Citroen Taxis appear, followed by the release of a newer car model, the Type C, a lighter more compact but less powerful vehicle than its predecessor, the type A. This particular vehicle was also available in a three seater version called 'Le Trefle' (Clover Leaf) which garnered a lot of acclaim. More advanced models would be introduced years later, such as as the B12 in 1925 and the B14 in 1927. Right before the beginning of the 30's, Citroen would introduce the C4 and the C6, the latter having been an important achievement for the French constructor as it was both his first 6-cylinder car and the first to reach 62 mph. Unlike tis competitors at the time, Citroen made use of vast advertising campaigns as well as elaborate and lengthy publicity crusades. Airplanes could be seen scribbling the name Citroen over Paris in 1922nd three years later citizens could read the same message on the Eiffel Tower, written in light. To get an idea of Citroen's costly methods and almost Texan-like think-big style, 200,000 light bulbs and miles of wiring were necessary to 'Citroenize' le Tour d'Eiffel. His crusades to popularize the advantages of motorized vehicles are not less popular. Citroen crossed the Sahara desert for the first time in a 1922-1923 motorized expedition, covered the distance from Algeria to the southern tip of the African continent, the Cape of Good Hope via Kenya in the 1924-25  'Black Journey' and drove from Beirut to Beijing in a second endeavor  labeled as the 'Yellow Journey' that took one year to complete as well (1931-32). Soon after Citroen's triumphant exploits, the first major technological improvements would arrive: the “Floating Power” engine that eliminated vibrations by using a rubber bolt securing method previously patented by Chrysler. World Record domination stages would soon arrive as well, Citroen having broke an amazing 106 records with their  cute-named Rosalie 8 model that covered 300,000 km  in 134 days. Thus, the cars' reliability was brought forth once more. However, just like Nelly Furtado predicted, good things eventually came to an end. The Great Depression dropped over the company like a tidal wave of financial trouble. Luckily, a Michelin lifeguard was around and saved Citroen from drowning. After performing CPR on Citroen, Michelin took the company under tutelage. Citroen developed further and by the mid 30's, it would unveil their greatest innovation the public: the frond wheel-drive or 'Traction Avant'. Although Citroen was not the first one to develop the system, it did boast the first FWD car to enter mass production, the Type 7. Later on, the 22CV and the 11CV would be born. Popularity of the new traction system would exceed any expected limits heralding god times for the company. The last famous Traction model, an 11CV Familiale rolled out the factory gates in mid-summer 1957.  The 60's marked the end of the old age of Citroen and launch of a modern epoch of engineering achievements, such as the introduction of the hydro-pneumatic suspension. Although known for their reliability, Citroen cars failed to meet the design tendencies at some point , conservatism that lead to a drastic decrease in sales. However, the effect was countered later at the beginning of the 90's when Citroen models took rounder and smoother shapes. New models and reinvention of older ones have assured the company's success so far and the brand is still regarded to be a purveyor of fine vehicles for over 75 years. French manufacturer with a well deserved reputation for innovation. And also a well-deserved reputation for forays into the utterly baffling. Nothing if not original, Citroen today offers an array of sensibly priced, not-especially-driver-focused cars. Now wrapped up in the Stellantis empire, here’s hoping Citroen retains its streak of originality.","Innovative, History, Reliable, Versatile, Affordable","Innovative, Avant-garde, Revolutionary, Original, Sensibly priced, Not-especially-driver-focused, Unique, Engineering achievements, Hydro-pneumatic suspension, Rounder, Smoother shapes, Fine vehicles, French manufacturer, Traction Avant, Michelin lifeguard, Visionary engineer, Technological improvements, Advertising campaigns, Airplanes, Publicity crusades, World Record domination, Reliability, Frond wheel-drive, Mass production, Punk-wave, Attitude, Visionary, Versatility, Affordable price, Technological improvements, Avant-garde French car workshops, Cartoonish, Sporty"
DACIA,"Dacia could be described as a nearly perfect vehicle for thrill-seeking drivers. The lack of safety features  that one would normally find on any other cars have turned the vintage 1300 model into a lavishly unsafe drive. Idealistically, dare devils would have jumped at the opportunity to take the old Dacia for a spin but the 1300 never became popular with racing enthusiasts. However, the 1300 represents only a chapter in the few-paged Dacia story. Dacia is a Romanian car maker that fortunately did not share the same fate as a Aro, the other Romanian automobile brand. Currently part of the Renault group, Dacia has a rather recent history, its origins being traced back to 1968 when the first factory was raised in Colibasi, near Pitesti, Arges county. Its first model range comprised  the rather rugged but aesthetically repulsive Dacia 1300 and a few follow-ups that were actually slightly modified 1300's, such as the 1310,1400 and 1410. Despite the Dacian inspired name, the car is not entirely Romanian, having been the result of a deal with Renault who provided the tooling and expertise. In fact the first Dacia models were strongly based on the Renault model 12. The cars that rolled out the Colibasi factory's gates were affordable and reliable, their maybe greatest advantage being interchangeability of parts. Dacias wer no Caddilacs but they were built in such a way that one could assemble one in a living room while vacuuming and watching an Introduction in Neuro-Surgery DVD. Strangely even for the average Romanian patriot, a lot of Dacias were rebadged and exported. Gone by the name of Denem, these superior models were the result of discriminatory engineering, having a separate assembly line where they would be carefully welded and bolted into aerodynamics-mocking splendor. As soon as this information leaked, many romanians would travel to Hungary to buy their Dacias. Because of the coercive communist regime that discouraged novelty, the Dacias kept the same body lines for some 35 years, becoming immensely outdated in the process. Additionally, the ties between Dacia and Renault were burned down. Fortunately, this urged the Romanian manufacturer to launch the first entirely Romanian built model in 1996, the Nova, sporting a redesigned body that made it look like flowing water compared to its predecessors. In 1999, Dacia and Renault buried the hatchet and became a couple once more. Several improvements follow and Dacia starts registering sales increases. Morally boosted by favorable reviews, Dacia reveals a replacement for the Nova in 2000: the Supernova. This model had exactly the same looks as the Nova which hints at the poor disguise skills that must have been used prior to its release. However, production of the Supernova was discontinued only 3 years later when the Solenza was introduced. This brand new model was a nearly perfect copy of the Supernova. Somehow, the very obvious resemblances go unnoticed for many of Romania's inhabitants. In a fortunate turn of events, an actual genuine new product rolls out the factory's gates in 2004: the Logan. Boasting a higher ground clearance, generous luggage and passenger volume, the Logan becomes a hit. Propelled by either an 1.5 8/16 valves turbocharged Diesel engine or a 1.4/1.6 gasoline one, the Logan registers the highest sales in all of Dacia's history. Shortly after its release, the Logan MCV comes along followed by a 2008 facelift and the release of the terrificly dull Sandero, a Logan inspired hatchback. Cheap and cheerful motoring at its best. Renault’s Romanian wing serves up unashamedly low-cost offerings – its Sandero remains comparatively cheap – that are, increasingly, competent enough to make you wonder why you’d bother paying more. So long as you’re not especially bothered about style. Or luxury. Or speed.","Vintage, Rugged, Cheap, Cheerful, Low-cost","Thrill-seeking, Vintage, Unsafe, Rugged, Aesthetically repulsive, Affordable, Reliable, Outdated, Redesigned, Cheap, Cheerful, Low-cost, Competent"
DAIHATSU,"Daihatsu appeared one century ago but the brand name itself was not used on any vehicles till 1951 when the 1907 founded Hatsudoki Seizo company changed its name to Daihatsu Motor Co. Constructor of small cars, Daihatsu first released low-priced small engined three wheelers before launching its range of four wheelers in 1958. Although Daihatsu car sizes may spark laughter, they are the result of a cleverly positioned brand. The small capacity cars it markets have reigned over the small auto Asian category, with the Domino and Charade models being among the most successful. Daihatsu was the first Japanese producer to  reach western markets, mainly the UK, through its 1966 Compagno model. Most of the early and present Daihatsu model range is comprised of three cylinder engine powered vehicles as well as a minuscule very fuel-efficient diesel engine with a below 1000 cc displacement. Although Daihatsu is nautical miles away from making any sports cars, it id develop a 993 cc turbocharged variant of its Charade model. Despite the roller-skate-for-giant-scaly-monsters look, Daihatsus have proven quite useful in the Oriental hyper crowded metropoleis. Models like the 3 wheeled Midget are a common sight in older martial arts movies set in the Far East. Strangely as it may seem, Daihatsu has also  involved in off-roader production, the first 4 wheel drive model released having been the Taft, a car propelled by either a 1.0 liter gasoline engine or a 2.5 diesel. Its SUV range was later completed by  the rather commercial-utility Fourtrak model in 1985 and the 1990 released Sportrak. Inspite its considerable efforts, Daihatsu could not compete against the small SUV range of other producers such as Honda or Toyota. Changes in Japanese taxes and regulations regarding K-class cars have also allowed Daihatsu to increase the size of its vehicles while still complying to the performance and dimensions compliances. The merger with the Toyota Motor Corporation has provided an excellent route for reaching distant markets like South America and Australia. Although Daihatsu has registered poor sales in Australia, it has successfully counterbalanced its revenue decrease through the subsidiaries held in Chile and Venezuela and by signing  profitable supply agreements with other car producers, such as Perodua, the second largest in Malayasia.

DATSUN,"Datsun is a Japanese automotive brand fading back to 1931, when a company called DAT Motorcar Co. Used ""Datson"" for its smaller sized car. The same stuck and in 1934 Nissan took control of the company and brand. They chanced the ""sun"" to ""son"" because it meant loss in Japanese. The brand enjoyed reasonable success in numerous markets, but in the early 1980s Nisan started to gradually phase the name out. In 2013, Datsun was revived, this time serving as an affordable car brand for emerging markets. Their first car is the GO small hatchback to be built in India from 2014 and based on the Micra/March. Many budget cars are planned, including an upcoming sedan likely to be be based on the same architecture. The no-frills attitude towards car building will reportedly result in the GO costing from as little as €5,000.

DODGE,"Dodge practically patented the muscle car. Little did they know they would become one of America's top Automobile manufacturers and that the Charger model, for example, particularly the 66-67 one, would trigger jaw dropping amazement at its sight. John Francis and Horace Elgin Dodge were making bikes in 1901 when they decided to move their company, the Dodge Brothers Bicycle & Machine Factory to Detroit, Michigan. Before Cadillac would outrun Dodge in engine development years later, the Brothers were supplying car parts for many producers. Their early involvement in the process of making cars lead them to starting their own business, entering the queue for a large order of recognition and notoriety. Setting the Dodge Brothers Motor Vehicle Company in 1914 brought them a step closer to the counter. The first Dodge automobiles shared some of Ford Model T's features but outran the latter in terms of ignition and other improvements meant to ease driving. One of the major advantages Dodge offered was a smooth, electrical start rather than the sluggishly classic crank start. Built for the middle class, the cars quickly became a commercial success, mainly due the clever blend of reliable ruggedness, engine improvements and style elements. By 1917, Dodge had produced enough cars to start thinking expanding in other car-manufacturing areas. Trucks seemed like something they could successfully take on and the Dodge truck division came to being. Dodge trucks were used by the US army during the First World War after which they kept being used as commercial vehicles. The Dodge brothers sold their business to Dillon, Read & company for the astoundingly large sum of  $146 million, said to be the largest amount in history to have been paid at the time. Dillon helmed Dodge management only for 3 years, passing the new acquisition to the Chrysler Corporation  on July 31, 1928. Due to Chrysler's financial conquests over some European automotive groups, such as the British Rootes group and the French Simca, Dodge is introduced to Europe in the 60's. Lightweight commercial vehicles are sold here under a different badge. The Dodge 50 series is fairly well received in the UK, becoming a favorite for military and utility operations. 1977 brought forth the collapse of Chrysler's European subsidiary and its adjacent Dodge branch altogether. The Dodge factory as well as some rights to use the Dodge name were purchased by Renault who resumed the production of Dodge's commercial vehicles. However, Renault only made use of the Dodge name till the 80's when it gave up control over the name rights. Only the factory was kept. Dodge is currently part of the DaimlerChrysler group and has been lately been know for its trucks rather than retro-future stylized muscle cars as it used to be know for during the 60's and 70's. Much like any other American car builder, Dodge garnered huge amounts of success at the time with the launch of the Charger and Coronet models, to name only a few. As far as the company's current status is concerned, trucks make the most sales, representing 78% of the division's venue. Still undergoing intensive promotion in Europe, Dodge have sought to reach  the same type of customer it did back in the 70's by launching a series of  mean-looking, rowdy  road-tamers such as the Nitro and Caliber.

FERRARI,"Ferrari has been manufacturing annoyingly outstanding cars since 1947, becoming a major player in all professional racing events and staying ahead of the majority of competitors ever since. Founded by rebel spirited Enzo Ferrari, the story of the famous Scuderia is that of dedication, distinction and really, really fast cars. Having become enamored with driving and car engineering in his youth and having gained substantial race car test driving experience through a series of jobs for different companies in Turin in Milan, Enzo set the base of the red-flagged road legend. Initially, the Scuderia appeared as a conglomerate of sponsors and trainers for Alfa Romeo whom Enzo had worked for as head of the racing department during the late '30s. His ties to Alfa Romeo would only last for 2 years as Enzo parted from the company upon learning of their plans to take over his Scuderia. Still bound to racing restrictions stated in his contract, Enzo had little to do except becoming a temporary supplier of tools and accessories for producers like Piaggio and RIV. After moving to Maranello in 1943, Enzo built the Tipo 815 which was the actual first Ferrari and not the 125 Sport as it is mistakingly believed. The latter was indeed much more popular than the first. Propelled by a 1.5 L V12 engine, the raw, beautifully unfinished model set the landmark for a future highly acclaimed racing dynasty. However, it would not be easy to rise to the rank it holds today. Following several tensions between Ferrari's wife and Scuderia manager, Romolo Tavoni, a lot of key employess were fired, including Tavoni  and some top engineers. Left paralyzed and unprepared to battle the Jaguar E-type on track, the company could do little to ensure regrowth. Help came from one of the people had fired himself, former chief engineer Carlo Chiti who brought new men on the team to complete the development of the 250 GTO model. The   mission of finishing the GTO was successfully accomplished by the Forghieri-Scaglietii duo, among others. The way the car had been built later earned the Scuderia several victories in the Sebring race. Ferrari would flourish in the 60's under the magical commanding touch of Forghieri's engineering talent. Models like the Dino became almost instantly classic hits, resulting in a great increase in sales. The steady cash flow allowed the Ferrari team to further deepen in research and new engine development that was eventually crowned by the ulterior release of the 250 P. During the mid-60s , Ferrari saw a set back delivered by the Ford GT mark 2 who abruptly ended Scuderia's winning streak at Le Mans. After safely emerging from a FIA  bill banning all cars above 3000cc from entering LeMans and having had to pause the 312 P model project, Ferrari would make acquaintance with a new contender. The menace came from Porsche who dominated racing in the early 70's , leaving Ferrari dreaming about the title. Later however, Ferrari would make a spectacular comeback withe their later 312PB model. 1973 saw Ferrari retire form sports car racing to focus entirely on F1. After a life caught between struggle, jet-setting and winnings, Enzo Ferrari passed away a age 90. His demise cemented the maturity of the Ferrari myth as well as it helped boost sales and the overall value of the brand. Presently, Ferrari is part of the Fiat group who owns the majority of the company's share. As for Ferrari's modern days of racing, they are far from being over. Between 2000 and 2004, Ferrari pilot Michael Schumacher went straight for world domination and won the World Driver's championship four times in a row. Subsequently,  Ferrari was the keeper of the Constructor's Championship for 5 years (1999-2004). Ferrari has long shed the mantle of sports-car status, becoming an icon while Enzo Ferrari was unofficially appointed Patron Saint of Sports Cars. Curiously enough, Ferrari  never made use of advertising, being a brand built entirely though tradition and quality. Widely regarded as the maker of the finest supercars of all, not least by Ferrari itself. The iconic ‘Cavallino Rampante’ badge has adorned some of the finest and most expensive fast cars of all time, and also a load of teddies and key-rings in those weird airport-departure-lounge shops. Ferrari’s road car division is inextricably intertwined with its F1 team, which – despite a lean few years – has still bagged more titles than any other constructor.","Iconic, Fast, Racing, Tradition, Classic, Outstanding","Iconic, Fast, Racing, SuperCars, Tradition"
FIAT,"Fiat demonstrates the intrinsic biblical-endorsed power of words through a simple spelling exercise. Fiat. Simple, isn't it? It sound whole and commanding and besides being and acronym for Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino, it also means “let there be” in Latin. Mimicking the Genesis show, episode 1, “Let there be light”, a group of skilled business men who bought the factory during the early 1910s, said “Let there be cars”. And there were cars alright. The first FIAT branded automobile rolled out the factory sometime in 1901. Engineered by talented Ceirano employee Faccioli, the coach-looking car was powered by a 2 cylinder archaic Boxer 3 hp engine. The investment group heads approached Faciolli on developing a front-engined vehicle. Faciolli's response was not the expected one: he resigned. Like any company would have done, a replacement was sought and found in the blink of an eye. Enrico took on the job and in a year's time he presented a new 1.2 liter four cylinder model, developed with technology borrowed from Mercedes. As time went by, the company gained in popularity and although it was becoming bigger by the day, it still hadn't exited its lengthy development and research stages. After many tryouts using 4 and 6 cylinder models, FIAT was ready to reveal its first mass-produced car, the 1912 “Tipo Zero”. Pre-war time was soon to be over and FIAT would plunge in boringly new production stages to cover for aircraft and tank demands. Post-war times however would bring Fiat lots of sales-figures related merriment – the 501 Cavalli designed model was built in over 45,000 units by 1926. After experimenting with some floppy luxurious big engined models, Fiat resumed the development of its highly popular models. The result was the 509, a light weight vehicle that exceeded every FIAT sales record to that time: by 1929, it had sold in more than 90,000 units. A series of newer models that matched or even surpassed the popularity of those before them were later released, some of the most notable having been the 1932 Tipo 508 Ballila. Sporting 995cc 25hp and 36 hp engines, the car was adopted by foreign producers. License-built rebadged versions of the Ballila were successfully sold in Germany, Czechoslovakia and France. A few years before the WWII outbreak, FIAT was quick to release the long lived 1500 and Tipo 500 models, the latter having stayed almost unaltered until 1948. When the war came Fiat was enjoyed an even greater popularity thanks to its top-selling models at the time, the 500 and the 1100, almost known as the Millecento. Although no major improvements were made in the immediate post-war years, the Italian company reached the amazing threshold of 1 million units of the 600 model – the Topolino replacement -sold. Still, Fiat had now ended growing. The 1957 released twin-cylinder Nuova 500 model was built in over 3 million units. In the same tradition of developing immensely popular models, FIAT launched the 124 in 1966, a car that would become one of the most widely known, right next to the 500. The Fiat sports cars had their own share of acclaim, especially the Dino V6 equipped with the 1987 cc Ferrari double overhead camshaft engine. Speaking of Ferrari, it was later absorbed by Fiat, in 1969 to be precise. The same year, Lancia was acquired. Having turned into a large group, FIAT co-opted Abrth as well in 1971. Presently, Fiat is developing a new range of sedans and city cars and has hi the jackpot with the rival of the 500 and the Punto models. Italy’s biggest car company, and major player in new primetime drama ‘The Stellantises’. After arguably inventing the city car in the shape of the original 500, Fiat has in more recent memory served up some big hits like the Nuova 500. And smaller hits like, well, most of the other stuff they’ve churned out in the last decade.","Innovative, Mass-produced, Popular, Lightweight","Innovative, Popular, Acclaimed, Iconic, Commanding, Powerful, Sporty, Luxurious, Highly popular, Widely known, Major player, Big hits, Small hits, Immensely popular, New range, City cars, Sedans, Rival, Top-selling, Highly popular, Acclaimed, Absorbed, Acquired, Large group, Mass-produced, Bigger, Highly popular, Standalone brand, Tuned, Faster, Cartoonish, Sporty"
FISKER,"Fisker Automobile is all about a man with a plan - Henrik Fisker, who announced his upstart company in 2007. Mister Fisker famously made a name for himself as lead designer for Aston Martin, and after leaving then owners Ford, he founded a own coachbuilding firm in early 2005. His first cars were re-bodied versions of the BMW 6-Series Coupe and Mercedes Benz SL 55 AMG. By 2007, a company called Quantum Technologies had developed an extended range electric vehicle system for military applications that they wanted to put into civilian service. Fisker had perfected a design for the car we now know as the Karma, and had no powertrain for it. It was a match made in heaven and so Fisker Automotive was born in September 2007. The company’s first order of business was to bring he Karma four-door sedan concept to the world’s attention, and they did so at the 2008 Detroit Auto Show in January, just four months after the establishment of the car company. But 2008 was also a year of automotive crisis in America, as the Big Three had to accept government support, and in the case of GM and Chrysler ownership. Fisker took advantage of the situation and opening a second facility in Detroit. The company originally expected to sell the Karma in 2009, as the production 2010 model was show at the beginning of 2009 in Detroit. But the company was repeatedly delayed environmental certifications, and so deliveries only began October 2011 in the US. The future holds a great many things for Fisker, including the Karma S hardtop convertible, and the Surf shooting brake. Also worth considering are the cars to be built using the smaller and more affordable Project NINA platform. These will include the Atlantic sedan and possibly a coupe or crossover.

FORD,"Henry Ford started the company in 1902 with $28,000 in cash from twelve investors, among which were John and Horace Dodge, who would later found the Dodge Brothers Motor Vehicle Company. He was 40 years when he first established the company's first factory on Bagley Street, Detroit. He would later incorporate the firm on June 16, 1903. Ford Motor Company would go on and label their models chronologically in alfabetical order, starting with the Model A to the Model K and Model S, which was Ford's last right-hand steering vehicle. Then, in 1908 Ford introduced the Model T, which was designed by Childe Harold Wills and two Hungarian immigrants, Joseph A. Galamb and Eugene Farkas. This model proved to be of quintessential Ford vehicle, placing the company among the most influential automotive brands in history. The Ford Model T was reliable, practical and affordable, which made it a big hit in the US, where it was advertised as the middle-class man's vehicle. The car's success compelled Ford to expand his business and layout the basics of mass production principles in 1913 with the introduction of the world's first vehicle assembly line. By 1912, production figures for the Model T alone reached nearly 200,000 units. This organizational innovation brought in the vehicle construction field allowed Ford to reduce chassis assembly time by as much as 10 hours, dropping from 12 ½ h to 2h 40 min. Besides ensuring the efficiency of the production process, Ford turned his company into an interactive entity by announcing a new profit-sharing policy. This would grant buyers a cut of profits if sales reached 300,000. As expected, sales effortlessly reached the 300k threshold and went even further to hit a record 501,000 in 1915. As part of a new set of financial tactics, Ford provided working places for the disabled who otherwise had a hard time finding a job, reduced work shifts and doubled all employee's salaries. Changes like these sparked a tremendous sales increase while also setting the base of modern working conditions. Still, the US and Canadian market would prove to be too small to fit Ford's plans. By the mid 20's, the Ford label had crossed the ocean and reached England, France, Germany, Denmark, Austria as well as distant Australia. The company's activity on European grounds further helped the brand's revenue growth. War would not shake the Ford company as bad as other car makers. Post WWI improvements include the introduction of four-wheel brakes and a series of new vehicle releases to match new consumer demands. In 1922 Ford entered the luxury car segment with the acquisition of the Lincoln Motor Company, named after Abraham Lincoln whom Henry Ford admired. Ford Motor Co. was one of the few big American corporations to survive the Great Depression, although the plummeting automotive sales led the company to scale down its operations and lay off many workers. In May 1929, Ford Motor Co. signed an agreement with the Soviet Union to provide technical assistance until 1938 to construct an integrated automobile-manufacturing plant at Nizhny Novgorod, in exchange for the Soviets purchasing $13 million worth of automobiles and parts. Under this agreement many American engineers and skilled auto workers went in 1932 to work on the Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod (GAZ), or Gorki Automotive Plant. The few who remained in the Soviet Union after the completion of the plant fell victims to Stalin's Great Terror, ending either shot or exiled to Soviet gulags. With the arrival of WWII Ford increased its influence on the global stage becoming an active player in the war effort, a thing underlined by US President Franklin Roosevelt referring to Detroit as the ""Arsenal of Democracy."" When the US War Department handed production of B-24 Liberator airplanes to Ford, the output rose to 20 airplanes per day instead of only one per day managed by the Consolidated Aircraft Corporation. After WWII Ford continued its passenger vehicle operations and in 1955 introduced the iconic Thunderbird model. Then it introduced the Edsel brand in 1958, which proved to be a failure and was dissolved in 1960. Part Edsel's failure as an automotive brand resided in the onset of the 1957 recession in the States and the vehicle's high price tag. Ford Motor Co. managed to get back up from its Edsel failure with the introduction of the Falcon model in 1960 and the Mustang in 1964. The company's next major step was represented by the formation of Ford Europe division in 1967. Ford plunged into a state of brand-fatigue that would bring the company to the point of near bankruptcy. Following major sales losses in the 2000's, Ford was pinned against the wall by debts and the imminence of closing down. Preferring to make it back on its own, Ford mortgaged all of its assets in 2006. As of then, the company has releases a variety of new models both under the Ford brand name and the rest of the sub-brands it owns such as fresher and edgier Mercuries and flashier Lincolns, Ford's luxury division. Business in Europe has also been good for Ford, especially after the introduction of the Focus model in 1997 and although it hasn't fully recovered, it's definitely on the way to regaining popularity.

HOLDEN,"Holden is the emblem of the outback, an ostensibly rugged car  that has ben Australia's nr. 1 drive for almost 70 years now. Years before Daimler would build his motorized coach in 1885 setting the cornerstone in automobile development, a saddlery opened in Adelaide, Australia. Established by British immigrant James Alexander Holden in 1856, the small firm went through a series and partnerships, changing its profile in the process. The saddlery began offering minor car upholstery repairs and started production of hoods and side curtains. The company's area of expertise extended until in 1913 when the Holden workshop began producing motorcycle sidecar bodies. Thus, Holden's Motor Body Builders Ltd, or HMBB, came to be in 1999.Again, the company's activity broadened to the point of manufacturing different types of bodies to match chassis important form different foreign producers, such as Chevrolet. GM, who had already encompassed Chevrolet and had started to establish subsidiaries worldwide caught an eye of Holden's business and purchased it in 1931. Holden has been part of Gm ever since, having been renamed into GM Holden Ltd. The Australian car manufacturer was a great investment as  it soon turned into Australia's main car maker. Following Holden's merger with the American automotive industry colossus, the latter was persuaded by the Austalian government to build an 'aboriginal' vehicle. In response to these demands, the 48/215 was released in 1948. Based on a 1949 Chevy design, the medium-seized  2.1 liter engine equipped car was strange to any fancy mechanics. Instead, it was reliable and powerful enough to become an instant favorite. Its supremacy was threatened by increasing competition but managed to hold the top-selling car position throughout that time. The futility of the competitor's efforts allowed Holden to focus on developing new models and reach new grounds. Several cars such as the Kingswood and Ute were released and exported to New Zeeland, South Africa and Indonesia among others where they sold as rebadged Holdens or Chevys. During the 70's, Holden has produced a variety of Vauxhall based cars, including the popular Tonara that was later replaced by the medium-sized Camira. Ironically, Camira became the inspiration for a later Vauxhall model, the Cavalier. The 80's brought forth a government conducted automotive industry restructuring plan which allowed full model share among local manufacturers. Following an agreement with  Japanese producers  Nissan and establishment of a joint venture (UAAI) with Toyota, Holden began selling rebadged versions of the Nissan Pulsar and Toyota Camry and Corolla. Holden kept these models in production until the 90's when the UAAI, the Australian Automobile Industries, was dissolved. Subsequently, Holden leaned towards GM and began producing cars inspired from GM owned products. Opel became a constant source of Holden vehicle offerings with models such as the Astra and Vectra. The Corsa was also acquired, having been sold as the Holden Barina. Starting with the 21st century Holden has partially discarded the Opel models and has started looking  into the GM owned Daewoo auto-catalog for inspiration. It is still one of the leading brands in Australia while its lion-badge is a common sight on cars in South Africa, Trinidad Tobago, Indonesia and other countries where Holden cars are exported.

HONDA,"The circumstances under which Honda came to be are at least manga worthy. Torn by the second world war, the country was yet far from making a full recovery. Focusing all the resources that were left to rebuild what had been destroyed, Japan could hardly fill at once all the voids that had been created. The Japanese auto industry  was dazed, many factories having had to convert to cater for demands in military vehicles and aircraft. The open spots that war had created had to be occupied fast and Honda was quick enough to settle on grounds that would later witness its growth as the 5th largest automobile manufacturer in the world. Soichiro Honda founded the company in 1948. The timing was perfect as many car or bike plants were destroyed during the war. Focusing on developing a cheap indispensable vehicle, Honda strapped an engine to a bike, delivering  a very efficient means of locomotion. Cheap and versatile, it set the cornerstone in Honda's incredible expansion. Ten years later, Honda would reach American land and establish the American Honda Co. World domination would naturally follow, made easy through clever subsidiary locations and dealership settlements. The bloodhound-nosed company leader, Soichiro could sense that Honda would be big and committed to setting a new standard in car-production quality. This combined with his almost Napolean market take-overs proved to be a powerful concoction that allowed Honda to developed unabated by competition. The brand became synonymous with usefulness and innovative engineering. The company's motorcycle division registered a tremendous sales increase, pushing Honda on the motorcycle manufacturer's podium. During the 1970's, Honda became the world's largest motorbike maker. Its production of cars however, that had started during the 60's  was slow at sparking as much attention as its 2-wheeled drives did. Although it had entered motor sport competitions, Honda cars failed to impress the average American driver. Having been designed for the Japanese market, the small-sized cars had little close to nothing to do against the large vehicles favored by the Americans. In an effort driven by market-conquest desires, Honda launched the American-oriented civic, a larger model than any other previously released. Although still small compared to the US-made cars, the Civic became the first to attract the American buyer. The 70's energy crisis and subsequent emissions laws opened a second row of gates for Honda. Through their later Civic models such as the CVCC which was a  variation on the stratified engine, the Japanese car maker managed to meet emissions regulations without having to equip their cars with catalytic converters that besides reducing pollution also raised automobile price tags. In mid 70's, Honda would release another American-friendly vehicle, the Accord that quickly became Mr. Popular due to its fuel economy and easy drive. By 1982, Honda had reached heights that no other Japanese car manufacturers had before: opening a plant on American soil. There first assembly line was built in Maysville, Ohio. Three other plants later followed as well as the construction of one in Lincoln, Alabama and another in Timmonsville, South Carolina. The latest Honda factory opened in 2006 in Tallapoosa, Georgia. After building the brand in the States, Honda found it hard to compete in the luxury car segments against the veteran American producers and European imports so it introduced its on line of luxury vehicles in 1986. Known as Acura, the range comprises variations of successful Honda models such as the Legend or Integra. Honda was the first Japanese car maker to do so, follow by fellow Nissan and Toyota which have launched their own separate luxury lines, Infiniti and Lexus. The quest for a better engine was completed in 1989 when Honda announced the introduction of the V-Tec. Capable of variable valve control, the V-TEC syncs valve open/close times to increase power at high revs and reduce fuel consumption at low ones. Presently, Honda is involved in smart engine research, safety improvements and pre-crash warning and avoidance systems. As far as their involvement in motor sports goes, Honda has been constantly striving to hold its position with one foot on the podium and the other one caught in menacing holdbacks and loses against other Japanese producers like Yamaha, Suzuki and Kawasaki. The company's latest car-engineering improvements are primarily fuel and safety oriented, the latter having become one of the major criteria in car buying choices especially in the United States. The company's involvement in developing new cleaner vehicles has finally paid off with the recent release of the FCX Clarity. Powered by hydrogen cells, the car does not emit any pollutants, the only by products being water and oxygen. When its not developing new fuel technology, Honda is busy with being the largest engine producer on Earth, with over 14 million engines manufactured per year.

HYUNDAI,"Hyundai is a self-grown South Korean brand of automobiles established in the 1960's. Presently part of the Hyundai Kia Automotive Group, the motor company has registered a steady growth over the past few decades, having successfully entered European and American markets. The assembly lines operated by the company were built to match its size, the manufacturing facility in Ulsan being able to produce 1.6 million units per year. Founded by Chung Ju Yung, born into a poor family of farmers, the Hyundai Motor Company became the first Korean car producer. The grounds for founding a car company could not have been more welcoming since post-war years in Korea brought forth a series of  odd politics one of which stated that automobile imports were better than having a Korean car brand. Yung was quick to fill the void, having raised enough capital for the investment from his  very profitable construction business, opened  in 1947. One year after its birth, the Hyundai Motor Company signed a technology-share agreement with Ford in 1968. Soon after Hyundai's access to Ford's resources, the first Hyundai car was developed: the Cortina. This model was quickly followed by the release of the Pony, Hyundai's first entirely Korean designed and built model. Its blueprints however, were not all-Korean, the company having used Japanese technology from Mitsubishi to develop the car. Japanese constructors at the time had already developed wide range of models, many of which were  exported worldwide, mainly to the US and South America. The Pony model was the first Hyundai to be shipped overseas in 1975. However, Hyundai would only cross US borders later, in 1986, with the release of the Excel. The subcompact car was an instant hit with its fairly small price tag accounting for most of its popularity. The Excel was such a hit that it sold in over 100,00 units in the first seven months. This was the last automobile that Hyundai produced before resorting to their own technology in 1988. The Sonata was their first born, a mid-seize car that marked the beginning of a new era. Despite the steps the company had taken into building a strong brand image, the reputation Hyundai  had previously collected was lost because of  poor quality and reliability complaints. As soon as the 90's came, Hyundai was short of air on American territory, struggling for one last gasp. Instead of  retreating, the company made massive investments in new design and technology. By the time the new millennium came, the company had already reinstated as one quality car manufacturer. Sales increased once more and with them so did the buyer's confidence in Hyundai. The sudden shift in consumer behavior was made possible by eliminating all worries regarding the vehicle's reliability through the introduction of a 10 year warranty to US sold vehicles only. Since few companies could top that, Hyundai quickly earned a spot in the world's top -10 car manufacturers. Hyundai is currently operating in 193 countries, selling vehicles through approximately 5,000 showrooms and dealerships. Sales have also aided image growth, the brand having entered the first 100 most valuable brands of the world. Its recent history is strongly connected to investments in technology and ample advertising campaigns. Indeed, communication is one of Hyundai's inherent elements, best described by their logo: the stylized H is in fact a representation of two men (brand-buyer) shaking hands.

INEOS,"Sir Jim Radcliffe, the billionaire chairman of the Ineos Group Limited, a multinational chemical company that had about 20 standalone business units under its roof. Besides, Ineos was already a sponsor for major sporting events and teams worldwide. Thus, the company's owner was not a stranger to outdoor-loving people. He understood their needs and found a way to give them exactly that, expanding Ineos' business in the process. As an automotive enthusiast who owned an old Land Rover Defender, he thought about creating a replacement for his aged vehicle. He thought that other people had the same desire but couldn't get what they wanted because that classic car was no longer in production. So he went to Land Rover at Solihull to buy the tooling and rights for the Defender designs but was turned down. But that didn't stop him. At a beer talk in Radcliffe's favorite pub, The Grenadier, from Belgravia, London, he launched his own automotive brand and built a capable off-road vehicle. Since he already had the money and the connections in the automotive business, he started to look for a powertrain supplier. Thus, he inked a deal with the German automaker BMW for both gasoline and turbo-diesel engines. Besides the original drivetrains supplied by BMW, the brand also announced that it started working with Hyundai for fuel-cell powertrains. As soon as the first sketches went out, Radcliffe entered into a legal dispute with Land Rover about the vehicle's design. This battle was ultimately won by the young car company against the famous British automaker. Another setback was the location of the factory. While in the beginning, Sir Radcliffe wanted to build the vehicle in the UK, he had to change his plans and move to Hambach, France, to the former plant that used to manufacture Smart vehicles. After trials and errors, the new automaker finally started the series production in late 2022.

INFINITI,"Infiniti is Nissan's luxury car division. Established in 1989 to compete on the US premium auto market alongside brands like fellow Japanese Acura and Lexus as well as European-based BMW,  Audi and BMW, Infiniti managed to create a global network in a fairly little amount of time. Its history can be traced back two decades ago when the company's first vehicles were sold. Part of the Oriental commercial tsunami, Infiniti swept across the American land with remarkable speed but with little strength. Freshly born, it did not scream loud enough to be heard. Sales of their first model, the Q45 were fairly poor as a result of what is widely believed to have been slightly bad advertising. In attempt to draw attention to their cars, Infiniti resorted to a series of Zen-inspired commercials that showed the car very briefly or not at all in some cases. However, Infiniti concentrated resources in a second ad campaign and production of superior quality automobiles that eventually paid off. Based on Nissan's platforms, most Infinitis are redesigned models, except their latest range which includes  the sporty G37 and the luxurious SUV FX that mark the brand's attempt of becoming a truly separate entity. No matter how good or bad Infiniti's ad strategy was, its vehicles were truly attention worthy. The Q45 for example sported a brawny 278 hp V8 engine, four wheel steering and active suspension, all of these features having been a premiere for automobiles in its class. Meticulously executed trims and fine finishes further added to the car's overall appearance. Even the Infiniti badge hints at the extent the company would go to develop a quality top-selling product: far. Comparisons are lost within infinity thus 'far' becomes incommensurable. The horizontal bars shaped to form a stylized highway meet somewhere close to the horizon which is never a fixed point. Besides clever product badging and advertising, Infiniti has been striving to stay on top ever since it became a stable brand. If the car-market context of that time is to be taken into consideration, Infiniti did good considering that European markets had surpassed traditional brands like Lincoln and Cadillac. The beginning of the 1990's saw Infiniti launching a second model, the M30 which sold rather slowly compared to the Q45. Towards the mid 90's however, Infiniti would release the QX4, a modified version of the Nissan Pathfinder, making the company the first to have sold a luxury SUV right after specialized manufacturers like Jeep and Land Rover. After experiencing poor sales due to insufficiently developed models and wrong demographic targeting, Infiniti was nearing extension. Just like Hyundai, Infiniti did not cease to exist but instead focused on developing a newer range of vehicles that ultimately ensured the brand's survival. The marque entered a new stage in 2003 with the release of the G35, a model predating the launch of the G37, a model farther from anything Infiniti has done in the past. The brand is presently making its way through European markets. Since its foundation, it has limitlessly grown, currently including 230 dealers in 15 countries. Its global operations have grown exponentially, having stretched form Mexico to Russia and from Ukraine to China and Taiwan. As with the majority of Japanese car makers, Infinti emphasizes the importance of technological improvements. Among the latest innovations, it has delivered the regenerative Anti Scratch Advanced Paint or ASAP as well as the Around View, an optics system that allows the driver to see a complete image of the car's surroundings.

JAGUAR,"Jaguars are elusive, carnivorous creatures that roam South American rain forests. They can be easily recognized by their distinct black speckled fur with spots larger than those of a leopard or cheetah. Such information would be most welcome in a National Geographic show but we don't work for them. We love animals but cover cars and this is all about the wheeled Jaguar. A sight not as rare as it used to be, Jaguars appeared in 1922 under a different company name and profile. Founded as the Swallow Sidecar company by William Lyons and William Walmsley, the company later dropped the production of sidecars to take on coach building that would eventually lead to the launch of the first Jaguar automobile in 1932. Until 1945, all Lyons & Walmsley made cars bore the SS initials, a reminder of the company's side-car making roots, when the lettering was dropped because of  resemblances to WWII nazi troops labels. Jaguar was picked as the new name. During the pre-Jaguar period, the company produced multiple models, beautifully styled cars that garnered as much acclaim as they did criticism. Indeed, some voices insisted that Jaguar was more about glam and style rather than pure performance and reliability. Headquartered in Coventry, Great Britan up to this day, the main Jaguar plant dealt more with bodywork design and assembly rather than going through all car-production stage. The engines and chassises were supplied by the Standard Motor Company while the first were later modified to fit Jaguar designs by William Heynes and Harry Weslake, two racing enthusiasts and passionate engine developers. After having build a number of luxurious saloon cars throughout the 30's, such as the 1932 SS1 and the sporty SS90, Jaguar amazed the automotive industry with the launch of the XK120, the fastest production car at the time. Sporting a 3.4 liter engine capable of delivering some 180 hp, the XK could reach a top sped of over 125 mph and accelerate from 0 to 60 in less than 5 seconds. Its sheer performance, affordability and sporty slim oval-shaped grille turned the car into an icon. The Jaguar had finally smiled, displaying a wonderful row of  competition-puncturing fangs. Sparking interest in other countries as well, the XK 120 has enjoyed a great deal of popularity having been built in over 10,000 units and becoming Jaguar's first export model. Upgrades of the 120 followed withe the XK 140 and 150. During the 50's, Jaguar shifted emphasis on building large saloon cars. The Mk VII was the first of a completely new line-up. Despite having been powered by the acclaimed XK engines, the new vehicles were not as successful. the Mk ii however, a smaller and differently styled saloon proved otherwise, becoming Jaguar's second best selling car at the time, having been produced in some 123,000 units. By the time the 60's came, Jaguar had already build a strong reputation that was further strengthened with the launch of the ferocious E-type. Officially revealed at the Geneva Auto Show in March 1961, the E-type was the ultimate eye-candy and record breaker. Beautifully styled and incredibly fast, the car could reach an amazing 150 mph. Heir of the C and D-type legacy, the new model was unlike anything the world had seen. The E-type was more technology improved than its predecessors, sporting an overhead cam engine, four wheel disc brakes and independent rear suspension, features that have turned it into a champ car and racing track nightmare for Ferrari who has lost several times against the British producer. After having been built in over 70,000 units, production of the E-type ceased in 1975 when it was replaced by the not so successful XJS. William Lyons' retirement in 72' was a blow for the company who could not rise to the standards set by its founder. It was save from bankruptcy by the Leyland company. By 1984, Jaguar bought its way out but failed to make an impressive comeback since it had lost its former appeal. 1989 was the year when Jaguar became part of the Ford Motor Company alongside British Land Rover. Ford's tutelage only lasted until 2008 when Jaguar and Land Rover were sold to Indian group Tata Motors. Jaguar's current line-up consists of  luxury sedans such as the XJ models, the executive and fresh XF as a replacement of the S-type, the burgeois X-Type and the sporty XK.

JEEP,"Everybody knows Jeep. From Kinshasa to the Andes and from Thimpu to Kamceatka, people are likely to recognize one when they see it. Not that, lets say, Mongolians living in yurts have seen one too many of Jeep commercials but because the brand has spread worldwide over the past six decades and that a large percentage of the Earth's 6 billion inhabitants have seen at least a couple of MASH episodes where Jeep vehicles are extensively shown. Jeep is currently an automobile brand and trademark of the Chrysler Group. Its appearance was sparked by WWII demands, at times when the US army had contracted three car builders to design a rugged, reliable military vehicle. Among the car builders there was one small Pennsylvania based company by the name of American Bantam. who came up with a surprisingly simple and solid design. The car, called Bantam BRC was surprisingly well built except for a small glitch that was regarded by army officials as a major flaw: Bantam's engine failed to meet the army's torque requirements. The car was rejected although it had been better built than the competitors' models. Its is widely believed that Wyllis-Overland,  a company comparable in size to Bantam, that had entered the race for  a US army contract had access to the latter's blueprints and technical data. After winning the contract, Wyllis went on to design what would later become today's jeep at their factory in Toledo, Ohio. Although, it had already appointed the winner, the US army became concerned with Willys due to their impossibility of moving production to another plant if required and because of the company's rather small size that made them vulnerable to espionage and sabotage actions. Thus, the Army commissioned one of the runner-ups, Ford, to build jeeps as well. It was at this point that the term jeep originated. Ford labeled its vehicles with the GPW initials which are still though to have stood for “general purpose”. However, jeeps were built with a specific purpose in mind and this particular name theory was dropped in favor of another one according to which the G stood for governmental vehicle, the P was a wheelbase indicator  while the W stood fro a Wyllis design signature. Bartam was forgotten and the Ford-Wyllis partnership proved most productive, the two having built  over 600,000 units during war time at an average cost of just above $300 per unit. the name Jeep stuck with the vehicle, sparking the genesis of a brand that would change proprietors often until last year. The first civilian jeep or CJ was produced in 1941 by Wyliss after which the company changed proprietors often. Wyliss was absorbed by Kaiser in 1953 , becoming Kaiser-Jeep in the process. By 1970 the company had become unprofitable and had no other option than to sell its operations to American Motors in 1973. The development of Jeep vehicles was resumed with funding from Renault who had also become interested in Jeep's activities. NY 1987, AMC had replaced the CJ with the newly designed and insanely popular up to this Wrangler model. After Renault had withdrawn due to auto-market changes, American Motors was bough out by Chrysler who later merged with Daimler Benz to create the Diamler Chrysler group who is presently responsible for manufacturing and marketing the Jeep. Jeeps are widely known for their ruggedness and reliability on rough terrain and are most famed for their solid axles that allow for increased ground clearance by fitting larger tires. Older Jeeps have extensively served in Vietnam where their name was translated into “just enough essentials parts”. The vehicle's off-road abilities are still its major selling point and the brand itself has amassed an army of loyal fans.

KIA,"Kia sounds surprisingly playful for a car manufacturer's name and as the brand's tag line reads, they really are all about the power to surprise. In fact, the Korean car builder has done so from its very inception in 1944 when it began as a steel tubing and bicycle parts producer. Six years later, Kia would reveal Korea's first bike. Once the first step was made, Kia rushed through the process of developing light means of transport, such as scooters and fast forwarded through motorcycle building upon the point of reaching the necessary resources and experience to start building cars. The whole conversion process took Kia about two and a half decades to complete. Bigger, richer and propelled by the enthrallment of having their own car brand, Kia poured a considerable amount of cash into a plant to accommodate its assembly lines.  By 1973, the new facility at Sohari saw completion, becoming Korea's first of its kind. Fully integrated and equipped with the latest cutting, bolting and welding machinery, the plant ulteriorly became the womb in which Kore's first internal-combustion gasoline engine would develop. The first Kia built car was unveiled one year later, a medium passenger car named Brisa. Kia's sounding debut and modern technology caught the eye of different foreign producers(e.g. Peugeot and Fiat) with whom it partnered to house production of some of their models such as Peugeot's 604 and Fiat's 132. By the 80's Kia had expanded to almost the size of its main competitor, Hyundai who was still the no. 1 Korean producer. Some of Kia's newer models at the time were rebadged and marketed abroad such as the Pride which sold overseas as the Ford Festiva. Only a few years later, Ford would manifest interest in the Avella, a subcompact car available in a 5-door hatchback version and a 4-dour sedan powered by either a 1.3 or a 1.5 liter engine. The Avella was rebadged as the Ford Aspire on the North American market. The Korean manufacturer had not yet reached US shores on its own but it was only a few strokes away. In 1992, the brand was incorporated into the US and timidly started business through a tiny four-dealership network that sold its first vehicles in 1994. Ever since, Kia has been methodically expanding, reaching every state except north Dakota. The main selling point of Kia cars was its affordability which was later supplemented by Kia's expansion into other market segments through the introduction of their first sport utility vehicle in 1995, the Sportage. From that point on, Kia suffered a fate very similar to that of Hyundai, company it would  later blend into due to unsuccessful management of financial difficulties. Trouble began in the late '90 when the company became stagnant and thus unable to rollout new models. That's when Hyundai came into play. The major Korean car-builder got rid of  competition by means of merger. Both companies have experienced trouble and low sales due to reliability complaints over their vehicles. The somewhat bland styling was not exactly what buyers were looking for in a car either so both had to undergo costly restructuring stages. Kia found itself rejuvenated by 2001 when, following its owner's example, it started working on a new vehicle line-up with an emphasis on quality and long-warranty offerings. Ever since, Kia has been steadily conquering segments of the European market, especially through the Cee'd, Sorento and Rio models. The development of newer, bolder designs is also among Kia's priorities, predating a future line-up with the announcement of concepts such as the Soul, unveiled at the Montreal auto show in 2006 and the Kee, a fresh coupe boasting strongly appealing style elements.

KOENIGSEGG,"The history of Koenigsegg car company started in 1994, when Christian von Koenigsegg decided it was time for him to create the perfect sports car. This was Christian's dream, born after he watched the Norwegian puppet movie “Pinchcliffe Grand Prix” back when he was five. At the age of 22, he stopped running the “Alpraaz” trading company, and focused on his recently founded “Koenigsegg” car company. The success of his first experience gave von Koenigsegg the necessary financial standing to launch his chosen career as a car manufacturer. The Koenigsegg workshop was initially founded in Olofström, but in 1997 the company needed larger facilities and moved to Margretetorp.After one of the production halls was destroyed during a fire in February 2003, the workshop moved to a 4000 sqare meters land, which had previously been home to the Swedish Air Force. The initial technical layout of the first Koenigsegg car was drawn by Christian himself, after which Industrial Designer David Crafoord scaled the sketch into a 1:5 model. He also added a personal touch to the initial design. After the drawing was completed, the production of the Koenigsegg prototype got under way. Miraculously enough, the car was fully built by 1996. It had a unique fabricated monocoque chassis with specially designed suspension, brakes, wishbones and uprights.  The prototype went through extensive testing in the first few years, and several new cars were manufactured. In 1997, the Koenigsegg CC prototype was shown at the Cannes film festival and amazed everyone with its design and performances. This success enabled the company to go forward and engage in the creation of finished product. In 2000, highly qualified composite engineers from SAAB, Bentley and Bugatti were hired to have the final bodywork ready by September 28. It was during that day that the all-new Koenigsegg CC was scheduled to make its first appearance at the Paris Motor Show. One year later, the car received several design awards, among them the prestigious German Red Dot award and a prize for excellent Swedish design. The Koenigsegg CC was also voted the “Car of the Year” in the Swedish magazine “Automobil”. In March 2004, at the Geneva Motor Show, another remarkable car manufactured by Koenigsegg made its debut: the 806 hp CCR. Only one year later, the CCR  became the fastest car in the world, managing to dethrone the legendary McLaren F1 thanks to a smashing 395 km/h (245 miles per hour) record. Achieving all these performances, von Koenigsegg showed us all that dreams can come true if you really believe in them. Questioned about the secret of this success, Christian revealed: “I truly feel that our cars have souls. We at Koenigsegg have all poured our hearths into the creation of the cars and we are confident this can be experienced when driving one.” ","Sporty, Unique, High-performance, Innovative, Soulful","Sporty, Unique, High-performance, Innovative, Award-winning, Soulful"
KTM,"The popular Austrian motorcycle manufacturer, KTM, made its debut in the auto industry at the Geneva Auto Show in 2007, where they presented a prototype of their current product, the X-Bow. The production of the X-Bow officially began in June 2008 in the factory at Graz, Austria. The first models were delivered to their customers in August 2008 and by the end of the year, 350 vehicles were sold. For 2009, the first full year of production, KTM expects a sale volume of approximately 600 units. The KTM X-Bow meets the requirements for homologation in most of the countries of the European Union, such as: Austria, Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Switzerland etc. Outside the European Union the X-Bow is homologated in the United Arab Emirates. As for other countries that were not specified above, the X-Bow is classed entirely as a race vehicle and it is restricted to race-track use only. The production of the X-Bow marks a 50-year milestone in KTM's history. It also sets new standards among the small, lightweight sports cars worldwide. For its first car KTM used the finest materials, high-tech and the knowledge of their development partners, such as Audi and Dallara. Thanks to the basic version’s lightweight and the 177 kW (240 hp) Audi 2.0 TFSI engine, the KTM X-BOW sets new standards and outstrips supersport cars. With a weight of approximately 790 kg, the KTM X-BOW accelerates to 100 km/h in 3.9 seconds. And its fuel consumption and pollution emissions are comparable to those of a compact car with a high-quality engine.

LADA,"Lada's history can be traced back to the 60's when a car plant opened as part of a joint venture between communist Russia and Italy. Built on the Volga river, the factory triggered the accelerated development of a nearby Italian-communist-named town Toglietti who eventually grew around the plant, forming a small industrial community. Fiat models were the basis of early Ladas who were intended as a “people's car” form their inception. The platform of the Fiat 124 was adapted to meet the requirements of Russian driving conditions, at temperatures below zero Celsius and rough terrain. In order to achieve a rugged construction, the outer body was hardened, the overall ground clearance increased and aluminum brakes were fitted in the rear. The engine was replaced with a newer design sporting an overhead camshaft. Strangely, the engine, which was better than the one found on Fiat models, was never used by Fiat. Cold was the main cause of  engine malfunction in Russia and precautions were taken to avoid “inconveniences” like getting stuck in the middle of nowhere with few chances of survival. Thus, an auxiliary manual fuel pump was mounted  as well as a starting handle to cover for sudden battery loss. Lada, as it is commonly thought, is not an auto producer but a trademark belonging to Russian manufacturer Autovoz.  As the name itself suggests, Lada cars were built simple and long-lasting, much like Eastpak does its backpacks today. The first Fiat-inspired models included sedans (VAZ 2101) and station wagons ( VAZ 2102) which were later followed by the introduction of luxury versions such as the VAZ 2103, boasting twin headlights and an improved 1.5 L gasoline engine. By the time the 1980's came, Lada had already developed newer and fresher models. A great example of design improvement was the Niva, released in 1978. The model was quick to earn the Russians' admiration through its new body style, all-wheel drive system and powerful 1.7 liter engine. Several improvements over earlier models followed later with the release of the Sputnik, a 3-door hatchback that was later renamed Samsara. The development of newer Ladas benefitted from collaborations with German producers like Porsche with whom it worked over improving combustion chambers. Some of the models produced during that time like the VAZ 2105 and the 2107 went by under the name of Zhiguli which was later dropped because of resemblances to the word “gigolo”. Production  continued until the factory was forced to postpone its new 110 range in the wake of the communist regime fall. 90's models include the Gnom, a micro car close to the Nissan Micra in terms of appearance and the 92' released Natacha, a sporty coupe. Lada may seem to have operated underground compared to other car-producers but it has successfully unfolded its operations in other parts of the world such as Asia and South America. Presently part of a larger group alongside Renault and Nissan, Lada is fast pacing through Russian economy which is currently booming, partly thanx to its automotive industry. Following some major transactions involving Lada stock share sales, Russia has turned almost over night into the world's fastest growing auto markets. According to company estimates, care sales are soon to exceed ones registered by the German market. Undergoing a complex process of restructuring, Lada is planned to double its sales in Russia and to be reintroduced to the world by 2015. Meanwhile, the Russian manufacturer is harvesting profits garnered by its current lineup, comprised of  the Samara based Samara 2 3-door and 5-door hatchback, The Kalina, the Priora and the Porsche co-developed Silhouette.

LAMBORGHINI,"The story of Lamborghini is very close to a particular fairy tale involving magic beans, giant beanstalks and multi-million dollar exotic car empires. Ferrucio Lamborghini's “beans” were his outstanding repair skill and passion for mechanics that eventually got propelled him up the sports-cars stalk of standards and earned him a place in automotive history. Born in 1916 in Italy, Feruccio's talent was first noticed during the First World War. Through a fortunate twist of fate he was stationed on the island of Rhodes which, because of its positioning, was a rather peaceful place compared to the mainland. His primary job was that of fixing broken engines task that he effortlessly completed, garnering the respect and admiration of his colleagues. Upon returning to his home near Modena after the war, the mechanical whiz though of establishing his own business. He established a small motorcycle and repair shop that turned out to be a very profitable endeavor. Feruccio had become a somewhat prominent figure due to his mechanical skill which attracted most of clients. His business later expanded with Feruccio setting  a tractor manufacturing facility in response to Italy's great demand of farming implements. His tractors were built from war-waste and parts taken from derelict vehicles, wreckage, basically every piece of metal that could be saved and used for production. By 1960, he had expanded in the heating and air conditioning business as well, both having turned out very successful. Feruccio's entry in the car-making business would soon come after he had build wealth. Connoisseur of everything mechanical, Ferrucio became disappointed with some of Italy's top car brands for the vehicles they delivered, particularly with their engines. Former owner of Oscas, Ferraris and Maseratis, Feruccio was well aware of car engineering at the time. One day, Ferrucio decided to pay a visit to Fetrari owner, Enzo, following clutch-related issues he had encountered on one of his models. Enzo, who was not exactly known for his poise and diplomatic abilities, simply sent Feruccio for a walk. Enzo's behavior triggered Feruccio's ardent desire to build his own sports car, as an example of what one should really be built like. Fueled by rivalry and passion, the Automobili Lamborghini SpA was founded in 1963. The plant was built in Sant'Agata near Bologna on a 90,000 square ft area. Employees were soon found to fill the factory that took only 8 months to erect. Among the people brought on the team were top engineers and former Ferrari-workers like Giotto Bizzarrini, Giampaolo Dallara and Giampaolo Stanzani. The first V12 Lamborghini engine was soon designed and became the basis of an ulterior very successful range of cars. Housed by a Scaglione-Touring body, the engine delivered a spectacular 350 HP. Called the 350 GTV, the prototype was first revealed ate the Turin Autoshow the same Feruccio had founded his company. The car was a hit and orders started pouring in. The GT, as it was called once it entered mass production, was followed by the 450 GT and the four-seater 450 2+2. All three cars garnered enough funds to allow Feruccio the development a new vehicle that would be the most famous Lamborghini model until the release of the Countach in 1973. The Miura was a very egotistic car: it shared its features with no other cars. Its uniqueness stretched from front to rear bumper and from top to bottom over a beautifully designed Marcello Gandini body. Sporting a transversal mid-mounted engine, the Miura looked like a cross between a mechanical bull and a racing car. The next successor in the Lambo dynasty was the space-ship shaped Countach which premiered at the Geneva Auto Show in 1975. The Countach was an outrageously appealing display of drawing board brutality. Its futuristic look was further endorsed by the famous telephone-dial rims, 4-liter engine bristling with bull-inspired power and swing-up doors. Although it has an impact hard to comprehend nowadays, the car did have its flaws: high interior noise levels and complete lack of rear view. One could only park the Countach by hanging half outside the car and steer while  looking back. Despite its prestige, Lamborghini would soon be struck by financial-trouble driven orphanage. Following a major set-back of his tractor business in 1974, Feruccio sold the controlling interest (51%) of the Auto Lamborghini SpA to wealthy  Swiss industrialist Georges-Henri Rossetti. Further issues causes by the 70's oil crisis forced the Italian no-longer-owner to sell the remaining interest to  a second Swiss businessman, Rene Leimer. Shortly after the ownership change, Lamborghini was declared bankrupt. Fortunately, help from racing team owner Walter Wolf came right in time and after a series of tests, an improved version of the Countach was developed, the 400S.  Wolf's plans of buying the factory were rejected by the Italian Court who gave it to Giorgio Mirone on February 28ty, 1980. The new owner offered the plant back to Feruccio for a small amount of money but surprisingly, he refused the deal. Following Feruccio's refusal, the company would find Swiss tutelage once more, under the Mimram brothers. Under their reign, the company saw a second coming to life, gaining enough resources to resume the development of the Countach with the LP500 S and QuattroValvole being later released. Until 1984, the Mimran brother shad not yet fully acquired the company, having been granted temporary administration of the facility as proof of their skill. The Mimran takeover was the beginning of an extensive healing and later development process, the company having produced a variety of new models such as the gas-guzzling LM004 and 002 off-roaders as well as the  exotic Jalpa. As good as things may have been under Mimran ownership, the company was sold to the Chrysler Corp. in 1987, who would  sell it to to a group made of three Far-Eastern companies in 1994 one year after Feruccio's demise. All three companies were part of a holding owned by Indonesians Tommy Suharto and Setjawan Djody. After a series of complications, the small Italian super car manufacturer was taken over by Audi AG. The German investor resuscitated Lamborghini by focusing its resources into the development of a newer models. Audi played a major role in designing the Murcielago, the car that trumpeted Lamborghini's comeback. Models such as the Gallardo  and the latest jet-fighter inspired Reventon followed. Only  20 something units of the latter were built so far, all of them having already been purchased for a “paltry”  + $1,300,000 per unit.

LANCIA,"People who find the strength to give away their well – payed job in pursuit of their true passion are rare. Fortunately, some of those who do become known through their accomplishments. Such is the case with Vicenzo Lancia who gave up his accounting career so that he could built cars and deliver the world some of the most advanced vehicles at the time. Though some may say that 1906 was screaming with boredom in terms of entertaining and job opportunities compared to 2008, the beginning of the 20th century was arguably one of the most productive eras in history. Vicenzo Lancia was only 25 in 1906 when he founded his own car company with colleague Claudio Fogolin. With a propensity for everything mechanical and a nearly unsurpassed skill in engine diagnosis and repair as well as experience as a test driver for Fiat, Vicenzo Lancia was set to develop a vehicle that would change the Italian's and maybe the world's perception on cars. In 1907, he revealed the Alpha, a car offensively innovative for its time. Apart from having been equipped with a sturdy, reliable and responsive engine, the Alpha was surprisingly light: Vicenzo had used a tubular structure for the car's front axle instead of solid steel like the car makers. Six years later, Lancia would release the Theta, the first European automobile to have been fitted with a built-in electrical system. Before the 20's, Lancia had also patented two types of engines, a 45 º V8 and a massive and narrow 22º V 12. Such developments would lead to the launch of the spectacular Lambda in 1922, a model that was a sum of engineering and design breakthroughs. The Lambda had independent front suspension, floor-incorporated transmission tunnel and the world's first narrow V4 engine, to name just a few of the car's innovations. By 1931, ride comfort had been upgraded to the extent of introducing flexible engine mountings on the Astura. Similar to the “floating engine” patented by Chrysler, the system used small rubber shock-absorbers to dampen noise and cut vibrations. The legacy of technological improvements and innovative patens would be carried on by the 1933 Augusta, a model equipped with hydraulic brakes, advanced front and rear brakes and a “wardrobe” door opening system. The latter did not make use of a central pillar and thus made car interior access and exiting very easy. After the 1937 release of the Aprilia, Lancia went forth to take on racing. Commensurate with the company's cutting-edge engineering, results obtained in rallies throughout Italy and the rest of Europe introduced Lancia as the next great racing force. Benefitting from three fuel tanks, two external and a rear mounted one, behind the pilot, as well as full 4 wheel drive, Lancia's racing cars seemed as result of designs from the future. Lancia would also borrow Ferrari its whole team of technicians as well as designs, aiding the Scuderia in winning the World F1 championship during the 50's. The 70's witnessed the birth of a racing legend, the Stratos. Its ultra-light body made of aluminum and plastic reinforced with fiber glass inspired the appearance of later models such as the Beta, the Rally 037 and the Delta S4, the latter having made use of composite construction materials and advanced twin turbocharging and four-wheel drive. As many firsts Lancia have brought, its reputation started to decline during the 90's  due to low reliability claims. Ever since, the company has strived to make a comeback through the release of models such as the 95' release and the more recent Thesis, an elegant sedan claimed to be the epitome of driving comfort. Though the Thesis launch in 2002, the brand has partially returned to its core values, that of jaw-dropping elegant designs and under-bonnet near-perfection.

LAND ROVER,"Finding yourself stranded in the middle of nowhere because you thought you knew were you were going is bad but it's even worse when the cause of your distress is the very car you drive. Engine or suspension failure are not an option when going off-roading and Land Rover builders are well aware of this. That's why when the vehicle's creators, the Wilks brothers, designed the first Land Rover in 1948, they made it stout like an ox. The world-renowned vehicle was not the product of a lengthy car-builder's pregnancy with new ideas but rather an answer to a why-not question type. Maurice Wilks, who was the chief designer at Rover and proud owner of a jeep, began thinking of building his own vehicle when he realized that the one he had would eventually break down. Jeeps had already proven their utility during WWII and civil versions of the military vehicles were on the verge of entering mass production. These were great times for the British to outdo the Americans with the launch of the Land Rover. Luckily, Wilks proved to Rover-factory heads that his design would be a commercial success as well as a reliable multi purpose vehicle that could easily challenge Jeep's supremacy. The first Land Rover was revealed at the Amsterdam Auto Show on April 30, 1948 where it caught the eye of many. Far mode orders than the maximum that could be handled poured in, making a celebrity out of the freshly-launched vehicle. Built on a Jeep chassis, the Land Rover's main selling points were its rugged, light weight construction and ability of effortlessly covering rough terrain. Great Britain was still a colonial Empire at the time and took full advantage of its position at the time to spread the Land Rover throughout its provinces. Before befriending expeditions leaders and off-road enthusiasts, the Land Rover became popular with farmers all across Great Britain. For farmers to embrace the idea of switching from horse to Diesel-powered vehicles, the Land Rover had to make proof of its capabilities which it sure did. Soon after, it became the car of choice among gentlemen and land lords. Soon after, the Land Rover became the main vehicle to be used in expeditions and gained a reputation unbridled up to this day for its reliability in extreme conditions. In fact, the Land Rover became so popular and was the means of transport to reach many remote areas around the world that it is claimed to be the first vehicle to have been seen by 1/3 of Earth's population. Later models sported a sturdy 4WD system that immediately allowed Land Rover to breach new markets. By the 1970's, Land Rover experienced a sudden set back with farmers turning to similar vehicles of Japanese make that could do a Rover's job at increased affordability. The Asian car manufacturers had already made a reputation for their reliable vehicles and were close to conquering US markets, stage that Land Rovers were still far from. The situation was partially solved with the introduction of an improved Defender model that managed to regain some of its popularity. After   a few ownership changes, Land Rover becomes property of BMW under which several new models are released as well as some minor and major upgrades are performed on older cars. The Disco and Freelander are the first two models released under BMW patronage that make a significant impact on the SUV and MPV market. Rugged construction is softened over  quality styling. The 2000's found Land Rover and Jaguar on their way to Ford following a transaction with the American producer. As of this point, Land Rover becomes the target of unfavorable consumer reports due to lesser quality and reliability. However, the rightfully thrown press-mud is wiped clean of Land Rover's windshield as its cars go through a serious quality management process. Despite its comeback, the company is once again passed to a new owner as of this year having become with Jaguar part  of the Indian Group Tata Motors.

LEXUS,"If American car-manufacturer heads had been warned about a Japanese take-over in the mid 80's, they would have almost certainly laughed at the prospect. Humorous or not, the Japanese did conquer US, not through mecha led wars but rather through anime and cars. However, before the mild-assault began, there were a series of weird meetings held in secrecy in chairman chambers. Such a meeting was held in 1983 between Toyota chairman Eiji Toyoda and his company executives. Toyoda had not invited his enforcers over for cookies and tea but to question them about the possibility of developing a luxury-car line that could successfully compete with American brands. The project was labeled as F1 -Flahship 1- and proved to be a most lucrative  endeavor. The result was a vehicle that later became known as the Lexus LS 400 prior to its US premier. The LS 400 was not just a car that took time and resources to built. In researching American luxury-product consumer habits and lifestyles, the Japanese went as far as renting a house in Laguna beach in order to observe their “subjects” closely. Offspring of long-gestating consumer research and cutting-edge engineering, the LX 400 was a hit. Endorsed by insightful advertising, the LS 400 made its entrance at the North American Auto Show in Detroit, 1989 where it was one of the main attractions. And how could it not have been after 24 engineering teams and a few thousands employees worked on 450 prototypes at the cost of a paltry $1 billion investment? The main advantage Lexus had over Acura, that had reached US markets 3 years before, was its uniqueness. Unlike the first Acura models which were sold as rebadged Hondas, the Lexus held little connections to Toyota design patterns. Silent, ergonomic, powerful and reliable, the LS became a fierce competitor for European imports such as Mercedes Benz and BMW, whose sales drastically dropped following Lexus' trumpeting market entrance. Models like the ES 250 followed which along the LS registered enough sales to allow the brand expanding through an 81-dealership network. During those first years of sales, Lexus became the top-selling luxury car in the U.S. Things were going smoothly for the Japanese manufacturer, just like its cars, and in 1991, two new models were released: the SC400 coupe and the ES 300 sedan. The latter was marketed as a replacement for the ES 250 and quickly became the company's best selling sedan. Following the release of a heir to the LS 400 and the Toyota Aristo-based series of the GS, Lexus entered the sport utility vehicle segment in 1996 with the launch of the LX 450, a large car based on the Toyota Land Cruiser 100. By 1998, Lexus would release the RX, a top-selling crossover based on Toyota's Camry model as well as a new series of the GS. During the following years, further technological improvements such as the introduction of the Lexus Hybrid Drive system on the 2005 RX 400h, resulted in an even greater sales increase. Things were so good for Lexus that it has constantly grown since its inception. The brand has been introduced to the Japanese home-market in 2005 as well as it has in other regions of Asia and South America as well as Australia and Europe. By 2007, Lexus had spread in over 50 countries and it continues to grow. The company's “pursuit of perfection” is fronted by its current line-up, comprised of the IS, LS and RX series among others as well as the avant-garde LF-A concepts.

LIGHTYEAR,"In 2016, five graduates from the Technical University of Eindhoven founded the Lightyear company with a brilliant idea in mind: to create a production EV that could get its energy from the Sun. Thus, Arjo van der Ham, Koen van Ham, Lex Hoefsloot, Martijn Lammers, and Qurein Biewenga started to look for funding, and soon they attracted several million euros to develop their products. Worth knowing that the founders of the company were previously involved in a project named Solar Team Eindhoven, and the result was the Stella Lux vehicle, which was an energy-positive solar vehicle. It means that the car grabbed more energy from the Sun than it needed to move. The result was successful, so they used that idea and pursued their dream: to create a vehicle that could be used for months before it needed a recharge. Six years later and tens of millions were spent on research and production facilities, and the first product of the young Dutch company was introduced to the public in the summer of 2022. The car, named Lightyear 0 (zero), was already scheduled to enter production and planned for sale in early 2023. Their confidence was boosted when Valmet Automotive from Finland joined the bandwagon and helped with designing and planning assembly lines. While Valmet is not a car brand, it is a renowned name in the automotive industry. It manufactured vehicles such as Mercedes-Benz A-Class and GLC, Porsche Boxster and Cayman, Fisker Karma, and several Saab vehicles. But, with the Lightyear, the Finnish manufacturer went to the next level by investing in the small Dutch startup. In addition, it also owned two battery pack production facilities in Finland. Thus, their expertise was more than welcomed. In 2021, the team already had their first prototype ready for testing and managed to run 710 kilometers (440 miles) on a single charge, which was already an autonomy record for an electric vehicle. But the story didn't end there. After securing the funds, the project, and the production facilities, Lightyear was able to move forward and create a vehicle entirely built from recycled or organic materials. In addition, they also made the upholstery from ordinary plastic bottles (PET) retrieved from oceans. Even though the price of the vehicle was huge, the promise of almost zero costs for running it was almost unbelievable. And yet, it happened, and in 2022 the automaker released the production version of the car.

LINCOLN,"Lincoln sprung as an independent luxury-car producer in 1917. Founded by engineering whiz Henry M. Leland after his departure from Cadillac, which he had helped co-found, the company was named Lincoln as a reminder of the admiration Leland bore for the now defunct state-leader. In a macabre coincidence, president JFK was assassinated just like Abraham Lincoln was. At the time of  his death, JFK was being driven in a Lincoln Continental limousine. However, before such drama occurred, Lincoln was a fairly small company that supplied Liberty aircraft engines for the Army during WWI. Having teamed up with son Wilfred, Leland converted his factory to manufacturing luxury automobiles right after the war. Despite Leland's skill and potential of his vehicles, the factory encountered several design-related obstacles and financial trouble that could not be overcome. Forced into bankruptcy, Leland sold his company to Ford in 1922 for $8 million. Soon after the Ford takeover, Lincoln's first series of automobiles would enter mass production. Under Ford, Lincoln's styling problems were solved as were the financial issues  experimented before. Little changes or none were made to Leland's original engines. Coupled with production cost cuts, this would allow the company to toll out some 5,500 vehicles in December, 1922. As of 1923, newer body styles appeared, many of them having been the result of partnerships with coachbuilders such as Fleetwood and Brunn. This lead to the appearance of  a diversified range of vehicles comprised of large sedans and limousines that could accommodate as many as 7 passengers. Despite the fairly big price tags these special coach-built vehicles came with, Lincoln sales did not plummet. They did just the contrary, registering a spectacular 45% increase over the previous years with 7,875 vehicles sold. The 1924's brought forth the release of the famous Flyers that were extensively used by US Police Departments. The cars premiered some features that weren't introduced on private models until 2 years after. Two wheel disc breaks, weapon racks, armored windows and Police whistles were among the many 'accessories' Flyers came equipped with. Probably the most famous car ever made by Lincoln sprouted in 1932  Eugene T. “Bob” Gregorie's drawing board. The later release of the Zephyr in 1936 smashed open the gates for the release of the Continental. The latter was actually a modified 1938 Zephyr Coupe whom Gregorie had sectioned and added a vertical tire mount to. The car became so successful that it sold in over 5000 units until production halted in 1948. However, the Continental would not go down for good. It was later resuscitated  through the Mark II model. By 1955, the Mark II could be purchased for a stunning $10,000, as much as a Rolls Royce cost those days. Later designs, such as the Town Car and the bulky Navigator, aided Lincoln in becoming the best sold luxury car brand in the US by 1998. After a brief change of ownership between 1998 and 2002 when Lincoln belonged to the Premier Automotive Group, the company returned on Ford premises where it can still be found today. Despite its tradition as a luxury car manufacturer and presidential limousine supplier, the company has experienced a severe setback in the last few years, having lost against Asian and European imports. This is mostly due to the lack of new models, issue that Ford hopes to solve by reinventing the brand. Lincoln's ascension is still unspooling through the release of models such the MKZ and MKX.

LOTUS,"Anyone who's ever seen a Lotus car knows what the British car manufacturer is all about: speed and style. For them, winning on the race track is not enough, you also have to look good while doing it. Lotus cars are now the epitome of speed and maneuverability. It's a long way for the brand which was first established when Colin Chapman, a graduate of University College, London, built his first car in a lock-up garage behind his girlfriend's car. The year was 1946 and the car was dubbed by its creator as the Austin Seven Special. He entered it in a couple of races in 1948 and managed to snag some victories. The first car that he called a Lotus was built in 1949 and it had a more powerful Ford engine. While this model was powerful enough to beat a Bugatti Type 37 in the Silverstone race. After this victory Champan decided to focus on sports cars that would run in the Formula 750. He teamed up with Michael and Nigel Allen and together they formed Lotus Engineering Company in 1952. The first production car was the Lotus Mark VI which was running on the new 1.5 Ford Consul engine. This car too proved successful on the racing circuit and by 1955, enough orders of the car had been made to allow Chapman and his team to fully dedicate themselves to the company. That same year they entered the Lotus Mark IX at the Le Mans race but they were disqualified when Chapman reversed. Undeterred and ready for bigger things, Chapman created new Lotus models, including the updated version of the Mark VI called The Seven. This car was to achieve cult status, being in production to this day under the name Caterham Seven. Outgrowing its facilities, Lotus was forced to move to a new facility at Chestnut in 1959. It was at this factory that the all new Lotus Elite was to be built, with its integral glass fibre body and chassis. Lotus had already entered Formula in 1958 and by 1959 they'd already won their first grand prix with Stirling Moss at the wheel. Lotus went on to win two world championships with Jim Clark and still had time to develop a car that is thought to be the best sports vehicle of all time - the Ford Cortina.With the introduction of Lotus Europa Chapman was ready to ditch his kit car image (for which reason he sold the Seven model to Caterham). In the 70s, after the unsuccessful release of the Lotus 30 and 40v almost killed sports car racing for Lotus, but in the F1 circuit Lotus still managed to dominate.. Models from this period include the Eclat, the Esprit (two seat coupe) and the Sumbeam which actually won the World Rally Championship in 1981. When Colin Chapman died in 1982 at the age of 54, for many car enthusiasts it was the end of an era. The company was bought by GM in 1986 but later sold off to A.C.B.N Holdings of Luxembourg in 1993. In 1996 the Malaysian car maker Proton bought the  brand from them and is still controlling it today. Lotus withdrew from Formula in 1995 but it still manages to maintain its reputation as a sports car builder, with the Lotus Elise, Exige (and its S variant), Europa (also with a turbocharged S variant) and the newly released Evora.

MASERATI,"Like most Italian car makers, Maserati was also a family business, born out of pure passion for cars and driving. The Maserati brothers who joined forces to build the company, Alfieri, Bindo, Carlo, Eltore, Ernesto and Mario, were all in some way connected with racing and cars. On December 1, 1914, Maserati was established in the town of Bologna, Italy and shortly after it began building different racing cars. 3 of the Maserati brothers built racing cars for Diatto but when in 1926 production was suspended, they decided to make on their own models. Apparently, they knew a thing or two about how to put a car together for a race because one of their first creations won the Targa Florio race that same year. Maserati cars quickly became more powerful, upgrading their engines from 4 cylinders to 6, then 8 and eventually 16 (two 8 cylinders engines mounted in parallel). The trident logo is believed to have been created by Mario, regarded as the artist in the family. When Alfieri Maserati died 1932, the other brothers kept the company going and continued to build cars and race them. Five years later, in 1937, they sold their shares of the company to the Adolfo Orsi family but kept thier jobs in the company. One of the more important changes that occurred under Orsi management was the relocation of the company in Modena, Italy, where it still can be found to this day. By now, Maserati cars were showing their mettle on the racing circuit, holding up to the likes of Mercedes, culminating with a win in 1939 of the Indianapolis 500 and again the next year. Their efforts were interrupted by the war, during which time the most notable endeavor was a plan to build V16 town car for Benito Mussolini faster than Porsche could build one for Hitler. After the war, production resumed with the A6 series which was again destined for the racing circuit. The next step was to assemble a team that would build cars to rival Ferrari and Alfa Romeo on the circuit. In order to achieve this, new engines and chassis were required. It would be this team  that will eventually come up with one of the most successful cars: the Maserati A6GCM. With Juan-Miguel Fangio and other drivers at the wheel, Maserati managed to win the world championship in 1957 in the Maserati 250F. After that year, the company retired from racing after the Guidizzolo accident, but it still continued to build cars for racing customers. Instead, they turned their attention toward street cars. The first model from this new range was the Maserati 3500 coupe which had an aluminum body and used the same chassis as the Maserati 5000. during the 60s, a few new models came out: the Vignale in 1962, the Mistral Coupe in 1963, the Spider in 1964 and the Ghibli coupe in 1967. Come 1968, the company was going to change hands yet again, this time it was going to be the French over at Citroen who upped the number of cars that were coming out of production. Overall, it was a good trade, because Citroen took from Maserati its engine technology and Maserati took hydraulics over from them. Models from the 70s include the Bora (1971), Merak and Khamsin. When the fuel crisis hit in the 70s, Maserati and Citroen suffered a decrease in demand and Citroen went bankrupt. Maserati was taken over by the newly formed PSA Peugeot Citroen group which declared the Italian company in liquidation. Only with help from the government did the company manage to survive. In 1975 the company was brought back to life by former racing driver Alessandro de Tomaso which also controlled the Benelli motorcycle group. During his time as head of the company models became bulkier and moved from mid-placed engines, to front-mounted and rear-driven. Not until 1993 and the taking over by Fiat would Maserati truly get back its glory. Fiat bought the company in 1993 and make large investments. They launched in 1999 the 3200 GT, a two-door coupe powered by a 3.2 L twin-turbocharged engine. The transmission was designed and produced by Ferrari which had since bought 50% of the company (despite the fact that Ferrari itself was controlled by Fiat). Ferrari decided to change Maserati into a luxury brand. In 2005, Fiat bought back Maserati from Ferrari, after the maker from Modena made huge investments in a whole new plant which is one of the most technologically advanced in the world thanks to its high tech devices. Under Fiat, Maserati declared its first profitable quarter for 17 years in 2007. ","Passionate, Racing, Luxury, Technological","Passionate, Racing, Luxury, Technologically advanced"
MAZDA,"Born as the Toyo Cork Kogyo Co. in 1920, Mazda started out as a machine-tool manufacturing plant but quickly turned to making vehicles. The first Mazda car, called the Mazda-Go, a three-wheeled truck appeared in 1931, which a year later began exporting to China. This was the only car that was in production until the Second World War broke out when Mazda factories began making rifles. After the war, part of the Mazda plant served as the Hiroshima prefecture for a short while. Production and export resumed in 1949 with the same 3-wheeled truck. The first 4-wheel truck was the Mazda Romper, introduced in 1958. The first pasenger car came in 1960, the Mazda R360 Coupe. Mazda's first partnership with a foreign company was the one in 1961 with NSU/Wankel with which it produced and developed rotary engines. This was done in order to differentiate Mazda from the other Japanese companies. To this day, Mazda is the only manufacturer of Wankel rotary engines as the other companies (NSU and Citroen) gave up on the design sometime during the 70s. Mazda's paid off because its models quickly gained a name as being powerful yet light vehicles. The most successful series for Mazda were going to be the R100 and the RX models which eventually led to the company's development. Starting with 1970 Mazda began eyeing the biggest market for its cars, the United States. It opened up a North American branch under the name Mazda North American Operations and it proved to have the winning recipe. In fact, Mazda models were so successful that the company even produced a pick up truck based on the rotary engine. With 1973 and the oil crisis, the thirsty rotary engines that Mazda used caused a drop in sales but the Japanese company hadn't really given up on piston engines so it was able to use a 4 cylinder model on its cars. The smaller Familia series and Capella were born. But Mazda wasn't about to give up on its sporty cars and it decided to develop a parallel plant that would produce cars outside the mainstream. In 1978, they came up with the very sporty RX7 and later with the RX8. The piston engine also showed up on Mazda's line up with the MX-5 or Miata. In 1979 Ford Motor Company became an investor in Mazda with a 27% share after the financial decline of the company. Later on, in the 80s, Ford acquired 20% more of the company after a few joint ventures like using the Familia series platform for the Laser and Escort models as well as building the new Probe and the Mazda plant in Flat Rock, Michigan. The 90s started off with another joint venture with Ford on the 1991 Explorer which turned out to be a bad investment for the Japanese while the Americans reaped all the benefits. Following its fascination with alternative engine designs, Mazda started developing the Miller cycle engine in 1995. The latter part of the 90s proved to be not so profitable for the Japanese as the financial crisis hit in 1997, during which Ford acquired 39.9% of the company. From that point on, the collaboration between the two marques intensified, sharing engine design and even some platforms (Ford Escape with Mazda Tribute and the new generation Ford Focus with the Mazda Axela). For the future, Mazda intends to maintain its forward thinking and experimental technology, by developing a hydrogen-powered car. The prototype has so far reached a 200 kilometers autonomy.

MCLAREN,"Cars made by McLaren Automotive have only one purpose: of incorporating as much Formula 1 technology into a road car as possible. Established in 1989 that company hasn't been very productive but the few models that they came up with made automotive history. In keeping with their intentions, their first car was named the McLaren F1. It was dubbed a supercar by analysts and people who actually drove, and not just because it has a one million dollar plus plus tag. This three seat coupe had a V12, 6064 cc engine built by BMW. Only 100 models were made between 1992 and 1997. It held the title of the fastest production car for many year, with an unofficial top speed of 241,35 mph (that's 391 km/h for those of you used to the metric system). Now, the title has been lost to the Bugatti Veyron and the SSC Ultimate Aero TT. Keep in mind that while these two cars were turbocharged, the F1 was naturally aspired. There were several models made of the F1, the GT, the GTR with variants 64 F1, 5 LM, 3 GT, 9 GTR95, 9 GTR96 and 10 GTR97. All that experience was put to the test again in 1998 when McLaren developed the world's first tandem Formula 1 car, the West McLaren Mercedes MP4/98T. This allowed another fortunate person sitting directly behind the driver to experience the thrills of riding in a Formula 1 race car. Designed just like a normal Formula 1 car, this model had all the safety features that F.I.A. requires and then some. Built out of a carbon fiber monocoque, the MP4/98T has a 3.0 litre V10 Mercedes-Benz engine. In 1999 an even more exotic car was scheduled to appear under the McLaren marque. Codename P7, this was a joint project with DaimlerChrysler, the main shareholder for the McLaren Group, and the company that also supplies the Mclaren's F1 team with engines. It was called the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren, and by all accounts, it was going to be another supercar. Powered by a 5.5 liter suprecharged V8 engine which put out 626 bhp, the SLR accelerated from 0 to 60 in 3.8 seconds and up to 100 mph in just 6.3. The first SLR came off the assembly line in 2005. In 2006 the SLR 722 edition came out with more powerful engine and in 2007 the Convertible hit the streets. In April 2007 it was announced that the SLR would be discontinued  for the coupe version and in 2009 for the convertible version. As well as these highly successful models, the partnership between McLaren and Mercedes was supposed to bring some other projects that never saw the light of day: the P8, a car that was supposed to compete with Ferrari F430, Bentley Continental GT and Aston Martin DB9, the P9, a smaller supercar with a midsize engine and the P10 which was going to replace the SLR. But you shouldn't fret to much if you think the SLR is outdated, reports are coming in that McLaren is currently developing a new car, codename P11, which is going to be a replacement for the F1, with a rumored speed of 390 km/h.

Mercedes-AMG,"As one of the oldest carmakers on the planet, Mercedes-Benz is presently successfully selling its cars on most segments, from vans to passenger cars. Of particular importance to the Germans is the performance car segment, which in their case translates to Mercedes-AMG. The current standalone performance division of Mercedes was born way back in 1967 as AMG Motorenbau und Entwicklungsgesellschaft. This translates into AMG Engine Production and Development, while AMG is an acronym for Aufrecht, Melcher and Großaspach, the names of the two founders, Hans Werner Aufrecht and Erhard Melcher (both at one point Mercedes-Benz engineers), and the former’s place of birth. Back then, AMG was a private engineering firm in the business of making performance monsters out of production Mercedes cars, usually with the goal of having them take part in racing. They were quite good at it, and soon started expanding their expertise to road cars as well. They started out and continued to make, for a long time, variants of cars like the S-Class (W116, W126), E-Class (W123, W124), and the C-Class (W201). The group’s interest in racing was however it’s main purpose for being. Their track exploits began with a variant of the Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.3 nicknamed the Red Sow (or Red Pig). The car was seen on the tracks at the 1971 Spa 24 Hours and soon of the European Touring Car Championship. Later, towards the end of the 1980s, AMG began helping Benz with its DTM efforts, and produced a variant of the W201. As it usually happens when someone is good at something, Mercedes-Benz took notice of what its former employees were doing, and wasted no time in getting involved at a corporate level. For their efforts in helping the behemoth, the AMG crew were rewarded with official partner status. Things evolved even further, and in 1990 the two companies (and Chrysler, who back then was heavily tied with the Germans) formalized their partnership with AMG. Soon, the newcomers were being allowed to sell their own products in Benz’s locations, marking the beginning of a very successful partnership, one that endures to this day with at times incredible results. Over the past 30 years, AMG has steadily grown to become synonym with high-performance German engineering. Its product portfolio covers everything from the A-Class to the more recent SUVs, and every single one of these vehicles seems to be selling like hotcakes all over the world. There are now over 20 distinct AMG models that come not only as enhancements of existing Benzes, but in some cases models that are not to be found in the Benz portfolio, like the GT 4-Door Coupé. Separately from its relationship with Benz, AMG is also a reliable partner for Pagani and Aston Martin, whom it helped over the years with a host of engineering solutions. Just like these two niche automakers, AMG’s production approach differs greatly from the production lines from where regular Benz cars come from. At AMG, almost all engines that go into cars are built from start to finish by a single employee, with assembly taking place in Affalterbach, the location where the company moved to in 1976. Aside from the difference in power and performance and offered by AMG engines, the Mercedes cars the group tweaks are different from the stock ones in terms of trim as well. Most of the visual changes made are not only designed to set them apart from the other three-pointed star machines, but are also meant to help handle the increased power of the models. Separately, and true to its original purpose, AMG became a household name in Formula 1. It happened in 2011, when Mercedes GP Petronas changed names to Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport. Under this name, and using a wealth of AMG-tweaked hardware, the team has become the undisputed ruler of one of the world’s most famous racing series. For the past six years (2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019) not even Ferrari was capable of stealing the win from the Germans. Competing heavily for an apparently ever-growing segment with BMW’s M, AMG remains one of the most highly-regarded names in this segment in particular and in the industry in general.

MERCEDES BENZ,"The German luxury car-manufacturer has been around for more than a century, having elegantly drifted  the both smooth and rough curves of automobile history. Responsible for the modern internal combustion engine's genesis, the 'fathers' of the Mercedes-Benz brand practically invented the automobile. Many years ago when mahogany canes and high-top hats were the ultimate fashion and social prominence statements, two men by the names of Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler were busy freeing the world from horse-powered  transportation. The 1886 archetype of the modern engine, their device was not a result of team-work but of independent and synchronous research and development. Although both lived in Southern Germany, they never actually met if historical accounts are to be believed. Despite the equal share of the two engineer's contribution to the development of the four-stroke petrol engine, it was Gottlieb Daimler who garnered more attention that would eventually lead to world-spread fame. Following Daimler's successful results in racing, a wealthy Austrian business man by the name of Emil Jellinek became interested in the Unterturkheim-built cars. Daimler and his chief-engineer, Wilhelm Maybach's work had pleased Jellinek to the extent of him approaching the two with a business proposal: a large number of cars would be ordered in exchange to a name change from Daimler to Mercedes – Jellinek daughter's name -  and the right to alter the car's designs as well as the right to resell the vehicles in some European countries, including Austria, France and Belgium. Well before the WWI outbreak, Gotllieb Daimler had gained a reputation for his vehicles that was greater than that of Benz. However, the latter would  strive to keep up, managing to stay close to Daimler's tail. In 1908, both manufacturers shared the podium with winnings in the French Grand Prix. After having converted their factories to cater for Army demands during WWI, the two rivals were brought together by a a series of circumstances, dictated by precarious economic status and impossibility of self-support. Thus, the Daimler's Motorengesellshaft merged with Benz & Cie in 1926, morphing into the larger Daimler – Benz AG. Ever since, Mercedes-Benz cars have been some of the best cars in the world, standing as symbols of  flawless quality and cutting edge engineering. In fact, the men behind the brand are responsible for the development of countless improvements that cover every inch of a car's anatomy. Despite having been widely criticized for alleged forced employment and violation of human rights during the Second World War, Mercedes – Benz have been successful at building an automotive empire, strongly supported by some of the company's far-from-average clients, such as state leaders, media moguls and ridiculously rich families. Mercedes – Benz have become known particularly for their  limousines, most of which can be seen in most movies ever since the Lumiere brothers became famous for their 'little' invention called cinematography. As if outstanding product quality and world fame weren't enough, the Mercedes – Benz team has also fathered tons of innovations, many of them targeting the simple four-cylinder engine. 28 years after Otto revealed his prototype of a four-stroke gasoline engine, Wilhelm Maybach  perfected his idea and built an engine for Daimler to be used in boats only. Development of the engine that would eventually propel land, water and air vehicles fulfilling Daimler's dream, took some 8 years before being fitted on the Daimler Phoenix model, the first vehicle in the world to be equipped with such an engine. Meanwhile, Karl Benz was busy working on a four-cylinder horizontally-opposed piston engine as an improvement of his 1897 contra-design. 1900saw the release of the improved contra-engine and completion of Benz's work at the time. Some of the advantages the horizontal design had over its in-line counterpart were room and dynamics related. The opposed horizontal placement and firing order of the pistons meant very few vibrations, a lower center of gravity as well as more space for fitting other devices like turbo or superchargers. The early 1900's brought forth a second series of engineering innovations with Maybach's development of the “hammer” engine-design for Daimler that earned its name thanks to its dual-camshaft controlled lateral intake and exhaust valves; Daimler also came up with the Simplex in 1902, a racing car powered by an in-line four cylinder engine that featured overhead intake valves and rod-driven exhaust valves. To ensure low working temperatures, the Simplex design also boasted double walled cylinders to accommodate an even cooling water flow as close as possible to the heat source. The origins of hybrid vehicles are not as recent as one  may think. In fact, they can be traced as far back as the 1900's, when the Mercedes Mixte range was released. These cars used 45 or 70 hp engines to power electrical generators. A special device, or 'hub', was then used to convert the obtained electrical energy into drive power. Built by DMG (Daimler Mottorengesellshaft), the vehicles were quite a hit at the time having won races such as the Exelberg. Mercedes-Benz is also guilty of breaking a number of speed records, among which ramming the 200 km/h barrier is probably the mots notable. The idea of a vehicle that could reach such a speed as early as 1909 seems far fetched today but Benz's Lightning stands proof. Such a performance could only be achieved by displacement growth at the time and despite its lean-sounding name, the Lightning was a monster powered by a 21.5 liter engine. After several other improvements like the introduction of  3-valve dual-ignition and 4-valve engines, DMG would set foot in the turbocharger era. The company's early involvement in aero-engine construction paid of in 1921 when an engine based on WWI aero-designs was developed by Paul Daimler. As far as diesel trucks go, Benz did it first. The OB 2 diesel engine was revealed in 1923 and 1924 saw the release of the world's first diesel truck. Soon after Daimler and Benz joined hands in a profitable twirl of brilliant inventions, the 260 D model would premier in 1936: it was the world's first diesel-run passenger car. As expected, several improvements on the 260 D would follow. However, the German manufacturer's quests for leaner diesel engines would soon be hampered by the WWII outbreak. After taking a forced and most unwelcome break from passenger-car making and engine research during the war, Mercedes – Benz resumed their activities, releasing the 170 V model in 1946. Based on the 260 D, the 4-cylinder 1.7 engine it was equipped with predated the release of the 170 D in 1949, a car that reignited customer's interest in the brand while ensuring the company's comeback. During the 50's, Mercedes – Benz produced some of their best looking cars ever such as the 190 and 300 SL. The first was a compact roadster that garnered acclaim after setting a new world diesel record in 1959. The latter is none other then the famous gull-winged model that is apparently making a comeback through the SLC model that is still to be revealed. Besides its stunning looks, the 300 SL was the first production vehicle to benefit from early fuel-injection technology. By the time the 80's came, the world had already grown concerned with the effects of CO2 emissions and overall car pollution. Mercedes – Benz were among the first to comply with regulations through the introduction of the closed-loop three-way catalytic converter in 1985. With this and several oil-filter changes, like easy from-above access, Mercedes – Benz vehicles went further to become even more advanced. By the early 1990's, their diesel car range had completely switched to four-valve intake/exhaust systems and carburetors were dropped in favor of fuel injection systems. A few years later, Mercedes – Benz moved into developing superchargers which it did through the release of the C 230 Kompressor. After marking a new era in mechanical supercharging technology, Mercedes went on to cross new borders through the release of new engineering concepts and ground breaking designs. The BlueTec system unveiled in 2005 was developed with only one though in mind: cutting CO2 emissions, achievement made possible through the use of SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction).  Two other notable events occurred the same year with the release of the A 200 Turbo engine for the A-Klasse and the organic-looking Bionic concept. Mercedes – Benz was the first to fit ABS and ESP systems on its cars and lately it has truly crossed the line with the DiesOtto engine which premiered at the 2004 Frankurt Moto Show. The DiesOtto boasts variable combustion chambers while delivering the advantages of both gasoline and diesel drives. Its CAI (Controlled Auto Ignition) allows the spark plugs to stop firing at higher temperatures when fuel, gasoline in this case, can be ignited the same way diesel can. The route researchers have taken to achieve variable combustion chambers remains unveiled yet although it is sure to be made public in a few years from now when the DiesOtto is likely to start replacing regular engines.

MG,"No, MG is not a misspelling of the famous American car manufacturer GM, it's actually a British sports car brand that first started out in 1924. The MG actually stands for Morris Garages, a subsidiary of Morris Motors, an old British car maker. Morris Garages was at first a dealer of Morris cars in Oxford but pretty soon they began selling their own modified versions. At first the cars MG made were Morris chassis with coaches made by Carbodies from Coventry. These models sold rather well which prompted the company to relocate to a bigger facility in order to keep up with demand. In 1928 they became big enough to separate themselves from the parent company and MG now became MG Car Company Limited. That year the first original MG car, the 18/80 appeared, which was no longer based on a modified Morris chassis. In 1935 the company was sold by William Morris to Morris Motors which in turn was owned by the Nuffield Organisation. What this meant for the company was a new venture into racing. Further change of management came in 1952 when the British Motor Company (BMC) incorporated the smaller MG. It is as this point that the company's history gets hazy. In an effort to cut costs, the MG factory was closed down, a fact that caused unexpected uproar amongst workers but also customers. The MGB was launched in 1962 and it was a departure from the old lines of the MGA. Modern and more comfortable than its predecessor, it was produced with added upgrades until 1980. Between 1967 and 1969 the GMC series was produced but its large size and poor handling meant that it wasn't a favorite with customers. When BMC was turned over to the Rover group in 1986, MG went under the ownership of British Aerospace in 1988 and later, in 1994, of BMW. This wasn't going to last long as in 2000, the Germans sold it back to the British, with Rover claiming the victory. They became the MG Rover Group and based their operations in Longbridge, Birmingham. During the Rover Group period, MG sold rebadged Austin saloons like the Metro, Maestro and the Montego. Also, the two-seater MG RV8 series was revived in 1992, along a whole new series, the MGF (1995). This was the first mass-produced car since the 80s when production had been ceased. After BMW sold MG, new models appeared such as the MG ZR, the Rover 25 and MG ZS. By 2005 production on Rovers and rebadged MG models ceased and there was a rumor that the  Chinese, Nanjing Automobile Group to be specific, were interested in purchasing the British brand. By July of that year, Nanjing had already bought the rights to the MG name and the assets it came with for 53 million pounds. The Longbridge plant would continue to produce the TF model, while a new plant in China would take care of the MG 7 model. Also, a new facility in Ardmore, Oklahoma would take care of the world production of TFs. a new generation of the sports car was announced in 2006 which should come out in 2008. The MG3, MG 5 and the MG 7 have also received some upgrades.

MINI,"One of the most easily recognizable cars in the world, the Mini has managed to attain cult status despite the fact that it's as common as they come. The idea and the design of the Mini came from the British Motor Corporation originally, but the small car has undergone several changes when it comes to the producer. Back in the 60s it started a whole new craze because, despite it being very small, it actually had enough space inside for passengers and luggage. This was thanks to the innovative design of the front wheel drive and engine. Initially, the cars were sold either under the Austin or the Morris badge. It wasn't until 1969 that Mini became a marque of its own. The Minis were also quite efficient from the performance point of view, having a unibody that further reduced weight and granted more space inside the car. Its design became so known that by 1990 Rover Group, descendants of BMC, decided to trademark the car. The first Mini was produced in August 1959, the Mark I also known as the Austin 850 and the Morris 850 in international markets, while in the UK they were known as Austin Seven or the Morris Mini-Minor. Until the end of the first generation in 1967, the cars received several upgrades including better suspension and automatic transmission. The second generation of cars was produced between 1967 and 1970. They had a redesigned front grill and a larger rear window. It was these cars that were used to make the hit film “The Italian Job” in 1969. An interesting version of the Mini can in 1961 when John Cooper, owner of the Cooper Car Company saw the potential of the small cars and decided to create the Mini Cooper, a more powerful version of the basic Austin Mini Cooper and Morris Mini Cooper. It had a bigger engine at 997cc, 55hp, twin SU carburetors, a closer ration gearbox and disc brakes. The good reviews for this version led to the development of an even sportier version, the Mini cooper S in 1963. Cooper also built cars specifically for the racing circuit. These were particularly successful in the Monte Carlo Rally which they won in 1964, 1965 and 1967 (in 1966 they were disqualified despite finishing on the top three positions). The third generation of Minis, the Mark III, came between 1970-2000. These had bigger bodies, concealed door hinges and winding windows (previous models had sliding ones). Despite all their best efforts, the manufacturers simply couldn't bring that new air look to the Mini, now in serious need of a make-over, a fact which severely affected overall sales. The only way that the Mini survived during the 80s and 90s was to come up with “special editions”. This was in part the doing of BMW which bought the remnants of BMC under the Rover badge. These models were seen as cool fashion icons, a touch of retro in an otherwise modern market. But BMW wasn't finished with the Mini logo which it still held, in 2001, the technologically advanced New Mini was launched, which was otherwise unrelated to the old car. In 2007 the number of car produced reached 1 million.

MITSUBISHI,"Part of the Mitsubishi business conglomerate, Mitsubishi Motors has earned its place on the Japanese and international car market. The company's history starts sometime in 1917, when the first Mitsubishi model, a seven-seater sedan based on the Fiat Tipo 3, rolls off the assembly line. Not very successful, production was discontinued after just 22 models were built. True production begins after the merger of Mitsubishi Shipbuilding and Mitsubishi Aircraft Co. in 1934. Concentrated on building aircraft, ships, and railroad cars, the company found time to make a prototype sedan in 1937 which it called the PX33. Sadly, it was mainly for military use as the war approached. Only after the war did the company really got into car production with a small three-vehicle vehicle, the Mizushima and a scooter with a funny name, the Silver Pigeon. Then came the split of the former conglomerate, because the conquering Allies did not see with favorable eyes Japan's industrial development. A decade later, things in Japan were looking up and personal transportation became an issue again as more and more families afforded cars. Enter the Mitsubishi 500, a sedan for the masses, and later the Minica small car and the Colt 1000 in 1963. With sales rising, the remnants of the Mitsubishi conglomerate were united once again in 1970. The next step for the company was to ally itself with a foreign company, Chrysler in this case, which bought 15% of the Mitsubishi, which afforded the Japanese manufacturer the license to sell rebadged Galants as Dodge Colts in the States and as Chrysler Scorpions in Australia. In this way, Mitsubishi was able to raise numbers in production and set up a series of dealerships around Europe. But if for Mitsubishi things were looking up, the same could not be said about its American partner which was forced to sell the Australian manufacturing division in 1980. Two years later, Mitsubishi would enter the American market under its own name with the Tredia sedan, the Cordia and the Starion coupe. The car quota was established at 30,000 vehicles but the Japanese were keen to increase that number and they began a campaign of active advertising. By the end of the 80s, Mitsubishi had achieved 1,5 million units produced worldwide. In order to bypass the strict import regulations and to ease the tensions between the two companies, Mitsubishi and Chrysler founded a new vehicle manufacturing company in Normal, Illinois under the name Diamond-Star Motors which started production in 1987. The models that came out of this plant include the Mitsubishi Eagle, the Eagle Talon and the Plymouth Laser. In 1988 the company changed its status from being privately owned to public. Mitsubishi industries remained the largest stockholder with 25% of the company, while Chrysler upped its share to 20 %. Later, in 1992, it reduced the equity to just 3% and even sold its interest in Diamond-Star Motors, leaving Mitsubishi as the sole owner. In 1995, Mitsubishi Motors changed its name to the current on from DSM as it was previously known on the American market. Also, it opened up a new North American Manufacturing Division in 2002. In 2000, Mitsubishi sought a new partnership with the newly formed Daimler-Chrysler concern which cost the German-American group $1.9 billion, $200 million less than the original price once the defect cover-up scandal came out. It seems that Mitsubishi had systematically covered up defects in its production cars as far back as 1977, involving anything from failing brakes to faulty clutch systems. When the news was disclosed, the company was forced to recall 163,707 vehicles for free repairs. That, coupled with a economic crisis in the Asian region caused Mitsubishi a loss in profit and even  the need to downsize in order to cope with falling demand. A new breed of cars, revitalized models and forward thinking was what brought Mitsubishi back on track. The Mitsubishi i, a small car perfect for the Asian market and the new Lancer and Outlander were enough to put the company back on the market. This lead to the first profitable quarter at Mitsubishi in four year to be declared in 2006.

MORGAN,"British car manufacturers Morgan Motor Company have a long history that starts at the beginning of the 20th century, in 1909 to be precise, when H.F.S. Morgan decided to make his own cars, in the little town of Malvern, Worcestershire. The only difference between Morgan and the other modern day car manufacturers is that Morgan cars are still hand built in small numbers just like they were a hundred years ago. The early Morgan models had 2 seats and were either rolling on 3 or 4 wheels which did not exactly qualify them as cars, but rather as cyclecars. The company found a good spot on the market and decided to stick with it, at least for a while, when competition from the Aston Martin 7 and the Morris Minor began to stiffen. Like many other manufacturers, Morgan found fame by entering its cars in races. The first race he won was in Amiens, France in 1913. Based on the car that took the checkered flag, Morgan built his first Grand Prix model from 1913 until 1926. This car would also provide the general lines for the company's best known models, the Aero, the Super Sports and Sports. These cars had a front mounted engine that sat ahead of the front wheel axis and also had a steel tubing chassis. These would continue production until the Second World War when the company was forced to cease production. Only two departments remained open for repairs. Later, they became known as the V-Twin series due to their V engines. In 1932 the F-series was started, again with the three-wheeled F-4, and later with the F-2 and F-Super which were all powered by an Ford Sidevalve engine which was also used in the Model Y. These cars would remain in production until 1952. As far as four-wheeled cars go, Morgan's first attempt with this was the 4-4, first built in 1936. four-wheeled and three-wheeled cars were produced together also until 1952. An upgraded version of the 4-4 (upgraded as far as the engine goes) was the +4 that used the 2088 Standard Vanguard engine as its heart, whereas the standard 4-4 had a 1267cc engine. Later versions of the =4 model would be equipped with Triumph TR2 and TR4 engines (1954 – 1969), Fiat engines (1985 – 1988) and Rover engines (1988 – 2000). When large 4 cylinder engines became scarce, Morgan began installing Rover V8 engines on its cars starting with 1968. These cars were dubbed +8s and retained the wood body that made Morgan products famous. Despite the lack of development, the company remained profitable throughout its existence. In fact, waiting lists have never gone under a year in length, with a period of whopping 10 years at its peak. The only attempt at modernity was the 2000 model, the Aero 8, running on a BMW V8 engine. It brought tremendous power to a very cool and retro design. It's no wonder rich people from around the world rushed to sign up on the waiting list. The lightweight car had a steel frame, a wooden under structure and a aluminum “skin” on top of that. Because of that it got to 62 mph in just 4.5 seconds. The entire image of the company is that of a classic model and the management, Peter and Charles Morgan, son and grandson of the founder, seem to have no intention of bringing 21st century technology under the morgan logo. Ok, maybe there is one exception: the Morgan LIFEcar, a concept of sports car that will run on fuel cell technology. The announcement was made in 2006 but we have yet to see this novelty in real life.

NIO,"William Li (Li Bin) founded the NIO Automobile in November 2014, and, on the same day, he announced the first product: an electric supercar. The company founder was the Chairman of Bitauto and NextEV, and his involvement in FIA's electric racing series Formula E helped him understand the technology behind a high-performance vehicle. He was already a billionaire and decided to invest in electric mobility. That's why he established the NIO brand, and soon it received investments from American and Chinese companies such as Sequoia, Lenovo, or TPG. After 18 months since the company was established, William Li introduced the first vehicle: the NIO EP9 sports car. It was built only to show the company's R&D capabilities in developing new products, and the result was astonishing for its times. Its one-megawatt power (1,360 hp) came from four engines, one for each wheel. But the most impressive part of the vehicle was the active suspension and aerodynamic that made the car lap the Nurburgring in less than seven minutes. After the EP9 came on the market at a higher price than a Bugatti Veyron, NIO turned its eyes to the premium electric market, which was non-existent. Apart from some BMWs and Audis, there was no other special model. In 2017, NIO introduced a new model, a seven-seat SUV with an all-aluminum bodywork. Sales and deliveries started in 2018, and in the same year, the Chinese carmaker announced a five-seat SUV, with deliveries that started in 2019. With a company on the verge of succeeding in a market dominated by gasoline engines, William Li came with a few innovative ideas. Its cars used a replacement battery system. On the downside, the owner had to take them out in order to recharge them and then install them back. On the plus side, he could have them swapped with fully-charged ones and have the car ready to run in less than 10 minutes. NIO knew that the customers would be annoyed by the recharging time, especially on long trips. That's why it came with the idea of Power Swap, which was a service that could give the car a fresh set of batteries. They were not everywhere, but the company was expanding its territory, especially on the U.S. market. The company's founder also noticed that its customers had a need to socialize with other people who shared their ideas and built the NIO houses not only as showrooms but also as clubhouses for its customers. Moreover, it created a dedicated app that allowed customers to connect with each other. NIO opened the way to a different approach to the car market. Its management understood that a car was no longer just a transportation device. It also passed the show-off factor for luxurious vehicles and emerged into a way of life. That way was supported and promoted by NIO and led them to a successful business plan. With technology on his side, William Li asked the Californian Government to give its cars a license for testing the autonomous driving program. NIO started an extensive program on Californian highways, along the California State Route 1, and into other urban areas. The testings showed no unpleasant surprises. He competed against Tesla who will have the first full autonomous Level 5 vehicle on the market. The testing program was delayed due to the COVID-19 situations in 2020 and 2021, but NIO pressed harder and continued its program in China as well. Some called William Li the Elon Musk of China since both entrepreneurs shared common values and ideas. But the NIO was a different kind of carmaker. It was focused on premium family cars and especially SUVs. The NP9 was more or less a show-off while its other products were sold in higher numbers. Their swap-battery system was unique in the electric-car industry and ensured a fully charged battery in seven minutes, as a NIO user showed it. Another important step was NOMI, the AI assistant placed on top of the dashboard. It used programs to create a discussion with the driver and other car occupants while driving, and its OLED screen was able to display a smiling face while taking pictures with the occupants with the in-mirror camera. It also communicates with the main NIO server via the Internet to enhance its abilities. Thanks to its investors and a solid financial background, William Li succeeded in creating a brand that can revolutionize the electric-car industry.

NISSAN,"Known by many names, this major Asian conglomerate has been making cars since 1914. Today, Nissan is the third largest automaker in Japan. The Nissan Motor Company took over the Datsun company in 1933 and in 1934 it would take on the name we all know today. The first Datsun passenger car came off the assembly line in 1935 and pretty soon Nissan started exporting to Australia. In 1937 the Datsun Type 15 becomes the first mass-produced vehicle in Japan, which also comes in mini-pickup and delivery van form. Ever expanding the production, Nissan decides to expand into the United States. This move from 1958 was made due to the American influence Nissan had thanks to its designer, William R. Gorham. The models exported to the US were 1200 Sedans with a 48 hp engine, a compact pickup with 37 hp which later became a top seller during the 50s. By the time the 60s rolled in Nissan had already made a name for itself on both sides of the Pacific. Now, the company moves into another part of the market, starting to sell sport cars. At first, it would be the SPL 210, a narrow, high roadster had a folding soft top and a 48hp engine, soon upgraded to a 85hp version. Catering for the American market, Nissan introduces the Bluebird, with synchronized 3-speed transmission in 1962. In the off-road sector, the Patrol is debuted, with a generous amount of horsepower, that was marketed as being able “to climb trees”. In 1967 the 2000 Roadster is let loose upon the unsuspecting public and onto the racing world which it takes by storm. The sporty line is continued in the 70s with the “Z” line, one still continued today. The 1970 240Z becomes the best selling sports car in the world by offering quality and comfort at an affordable price. Sales in America start taking off until eventually, in 1975, Datsun becomes the number 1 importer in the States. Nissan starts expanding during the 80s in order to keep up with demand and opens up new factories. And just when everyone thought that Nissan couldn't get any bigger, along comes a whole new brand of Nissan, one aimed at a more luxurious segment of the market, Infiniti. In 1989, as the Infiniti project getting off the ground, parent company Nissan was celebrating its millionth car built in the US. As new plants get built throughout the 90s, new models are added to the line up to corner the market. The Altima sedan and the Sentra become front-runners as the best sold models in the Nissan line-up. Next, in 1999, it was time for the European market, Nissan signs an agreement with French manufacturer Renault to use each other's expertise and strengths. In 2002, the Z concept is resurrected with the 350Z, a sporty car that quickly wins over car enthusiasts but specialists as well. The ewly-formed SUV market will also be represented in the Nissan line-up with the Murano. Now, the boys over at Nissan seem to have a real hard point to make as they've released the GTR, a super-sporty car, the crowning jewel of Nissan motoring and engineering.

OPEL,"Now part of General Motors, Opel GmbH is a German car manufacturer of long tradition, being founded in 1863 by Adam Opel. Like many other manufacturers, Opel started out with something other than cars, in this case sewing machines and then bicycles. In 1899 he had already bought a car manufacturing plant that belonged to Friedrich Lutzman. When Adam passed away, his two sons dedicated themselves to building cars for two more years with Lutzman before setting out on their own. Their next partner in 1902 was the French carriage maker Darracq, with Opel providing the bodies. This partnership too came to an end in 1906 when Opel had enough expertise to make their own cars. The first model had been introduced at the Hamburg Motor Show in 1902. Cars were made at the Opel plant starting with 1907, in parallel with sewing machines, until 1911 when a devastating fire burned down the factory almost completely. When production resumed, only cars continued to be made and instead of sewing machines, Opel started making motorcycles. In 1913 they had already become the biggest car manufacturer in Germany. Except Opel didn't stop there and in 1924 introduced the first mass-production assembly line in Germany, the first model to roll out being the Opel Laubfrosch (the Tree Frog). By now Opel cars already had a reputation for being cheap and reliable, a fact which helped the company survive inflation and still maintain the title of biggest car maker in Germany until 1928. But the depression was nearing and the Opel brothers were now in search of a partner to help them push on. That partner was the American GM who, in 1929, bought the majority of shares but left Opel all the decision-making when it came to car production. By 1930 Opel was the largest manufacturer of cars in Europe. That and the fact that its partnership with GM gave it access to foreign markets made Opel the opportunity to expand production further and launch new models like the Opel Olympia, the first mass-produced car to have an all steel body and frame. WWII was a hard time for the Opel factory and indeed the whole company. The first car to roll out of the factory after the war was the Blitz truck, and then, much later, passenger car production resumed with the Olympia. The factories weren't fully repaired until 1956 when Opel managed to produce its 2 millionth car. Running at full capacity Opel opened up a new plant at Bochum where a new model, the Kadett, rolled out, marking a whole era for the German manufacturer. Next, the line up was diversified to include something for the sports car afficionados, the GT. Having made these changes, Opel retained its title as biggest car manufacturer in Germany in 1972. What followed next could easily be interpreted as Opel's attempt to take over the world. In 1963 it opened a plant in Ellesmere Port, England, then in 67 a plant in Antwerp, Belgium with GM. In the 80s there are several more plants being opened around the Globe: Zaragoza, Spain in 1982, a transmission and engine plant in Viena, Austria that same year, in 1986 (also the year the Ascona is launched) a new GM plant in Zurich, Switzerland and in 1989, after buying 50% of Saab, an GM assembly plant is opened in Turkey. As Vectra, the most successful model is launched in 1988, Opel introduces catalytic converters on all its cars. A year later the sporty Calibra is premiered, while the brand has already made 25 million cars since it first started out. in 1991 the Kadett is retired and Astra is named as successor. The Frontera and later the Monterey will be Opel's offroad vehicles launched one year apart, starting with 1991. In 2000, Opel begins production of the Agila, a microvan, the first of its kind in Germany. But the new century isn't just abot new cars, it's also about reinventing the old, as the new generation of the Corsa is unveiled in 2001 and the second generation Astra. The sport market segment will be filled by the Speedster (2002) and the Tigra (2004). Opel has made a point in staying ahead of the game and in bringing quality to the masses at affordable prices. Lately though, it seems that Opel might be trying to break into a whole new class, one with the other German heavy contenders, Mercedes, BMW and Porsche, where luxury is paramount, with the introduction of the 2008 Insignia.

PAGANI,"The brainchild of Italian designer Horacio Pagani, Pagani Automibili is known for making super fast cars and manufacturing a little carbon fibre on the side. The year that Pagani came to be was 1992 but Horacio was dealing with cars and design long before that. In fact, according to some people, his love for cars came very early because at 12 years old he was already making cars out of clay and wood. That's why by the time he was 20 he had already designed his first race car under the colors of Renault. He honed those design skills in numerous industrial projects until he was noticed by Juan Manuel Fangio, his personal hero who turned out to be the person to introduce him to the home of the supercars at the time: Modena in Italy, where Ferraris and Lamborghinis played. It was over at Lamborghini where Pagani found a job as a mechanic at first and later as head of the composite material department. Once there he helped in the design and production of LMA Jeep, the Jalpa, the Countach Evoluzione and Golf Caddy. By 1988 he had already developed a keen interest in carbon fiber and its applications in the automotive industry. The Pagani Composite Research was set up which contributed to the creation of the Diablo, the Lamborghini P140, the L30 and the Diablo Anniversary. All that experience  with exotic cars gave Horacio the confidence to fulfill his dream of building his own supercar, the C8 project as it was called initially. Later, the car would get the name the Fangio F1, to order Pagani's hero, the man who won the F1 championship 5 times. With the rising demand in car design, Pagani established in 1991. Basically, heading his own team, Horacio designed, engineered, modeled and moulded prototype cars. Only in 1992 was he ready to start work on his Fangio F1 prototype and to help him achieve his dream he started the Pagani Automobili company. A year on and the car had already gone from the drawing board to reality as it was being tested at the Dallara wind tunnel. Then Fangio took the project over to Mercedes, the company which provided the cars to help him achieve his victories. In 1994 the deal came through and Mercedes Benz agreed to power Pagani with V12 engines. Sadly, Fangio passed away in 1995 and that's when Horacio decided to change the name out of respect. The car then became Zonda C12, after an air current which flows in the Andes in Argentina where Horacio was born. The Pagani Zonda was unveiled at the 1999 Geneva Motor Show. Based on the Mercedes Group C Silver Arrows and jet fighters design-wise, the Zonda is powered by an V12 DOHC engine made by Mercedes AMG division unique to this model. One of the car's unique features was the circular four pipe exhaust at the rear. Other models include Zonda F, Zonda Roadster F, Zonda R Clubsport. A new model was announced by Pagani, the C9 to be launched in 2009. It has been said that this new car will not be based on the Zonda but will still be powered by Mercedes AMG engines. This is due to the fact that even if Pagani is an independent company, it works in close relationship with Daimler AG, especially with Mercedes' in-house tuner, AMG.

PANOZ,"Despite it sounding a bit Italian, Panoz Auto Development as American as apple pie. It was established by Dan Panoz, the son of pharmaceutical mogul Don Panoz. It's not a big manufacture of cars but that allows them to treat their few cars with better respect. Hand crafted and rigorously tested before being handed to their owners, Panoz cars bear the mark of exclusivity. The company itself was founded in 1989 by Daniel Panoz who had applied in 1988 for a job at the Thompson Motor Company, an Irish car builder. When the company was liquidated, Dan seize dthe opportunity and bought the rights to one of the chassis TMC was using, one designed by Frank Costin, the man who also built chassis for Maserati, Lotus and Lister. Just one year after the birth of Panoz Motors, the first model came out: the 1990 Roadster. Built in the company's small factory in Atlanta, Georgia, the car set about reigniting the true spirit of the American roadster. BY 1996, the AIV Roadster came into full production. In 1997 the company decided to enter racing to better promote their products. The difference between Panoz and other manufacturers was that their strived to keep their road cars as close to their racing versions as possible. The next model to come out of the Panoz plant was the Esperante with its racing version, the GTR-1. It was entered in the famous 24 Hours Le Mans. In order to better develop their products on the track, Panoz then intensified its involvement in racing. It moved Le Mans across the ocean into America in 1998, it opened up a racing school and took part in other racing championships, such as the US Road Racing Championship which it won in 1998. In 2000 it developed the race purposely-built Esperante GTS, a car which would serve in he Sports Car of America. Measures were taken to ensure the car was cheap to maintain and race, such as replaceable acrylic panels instead of fiberglass. All those efforts in racing paid off in 2006 when Panoz took the gold in the 24 Hours of Le Mans race in the GT2 class with an Esperante GTLM. Put in a nutshell, if you're looking for an American sports car that also races on the track, Panoz is the company to call on.

PERODUA,"Founded in 1993, the Perusahaan Otomobil Kedua Sendirian Berhad (Second Automobile Manufacturer Private Limited), or simply Perodua, is the biggest carmaker of Malaysia, just on top of Proton, the other large manufacturer in the country. Compacts and superminis are what Perodua specializes in, not to compete with Proton, and it is a known fact that the company doesn't use in-house built or designed components like engines or transmissions for its cars. Even from the beginning, the company used Daihatsu parts, as the latter held a 20 percent stake at launch. In 1994, the Prime Minister of Malaysia officiated Perodua's manufacturing plant's opening ceremony, while the first model, the Kancil, rolled down from the assembly line just 28 days later. By the 22nd of December 1995, 50,000 Perodua Kancil were produced, while exports to Brunei Darussalam started the following spring. One year later, in 1997, the 100,000th Kancil city car was leaving the factory and the same year marked the model's launch on the UK market. There, the Kancil was sold as the Perodua Nippa, and it was the cheapest car money could buy back then. 1997, Perodua changed its logo, replacing the square badge with a more fluid oval one that still maintains the 'P' and the '2' symbols in green and red. The Perodua Kembara made its appearance in 1998, representing the nation's first locally assembled four-wheel-drive vehicle. By 2004, Perodua celebrated its 10'th anniversary. Meanwhile, the Kenari and Kelisa superminis were added to the lineup. More than 500,000 Kancil were sold by the same year. The following year marked another milestone - Perodua's 1,000,000 unit manufactured. 2005 was also the launch date of the new Myvi city car, a model that received the Autocar Asean's Car of the Year Award in 2006. The most successful model of the time, the Kancil, got discontinued in 2007, and it got replaced by the ViVA model the same year, which later received the Car of the Year Autocar Asean Award in the supermini class. In 2008, Perodua launched the Nautica 4WD, a short wheelbase version of the Daihatsu Terios. The Malaysian carmaker fully imported it from Japan, but the grille and bumpers were made and fitted in Malaysia. In December that year, the company started to equip its cars with rear seatbelts, a feature never seen on its budget models so far. The following years saw the introduction of the new Alza compact MPV and numerous facelifts and special edition existing models to gain a global influence. It was another successful badge-engineering project built together with Daihatsu Boon.  That model was also reinforced by opening the Perodua Global Manufacturing Sdn Bhd (PGM) EEV factory in the nearby vicinity of the older one. The new facility spanned over 64,000 square meters and had an estimated cost of RM1.3 billion investment to build and equip. By 2020, the Alza was the oldest car in the Perodua's stable, but it was the best-selling MPV in Malaysia. It was refreshed twice, in 2014 and 2019. PGM has a capacity of 100,000 units on a single shift, which the carmaker could double, and featured increased automated welding, automatic body accuracy measurement, enhanced dust proofing, and a brighter and quieter environment. Following the company's trend to offer budget-priced yet reliable vehicles, Perodua partnered with Toyota right from the start. The Kancil was a re-badged Daihatsu Mira. Later on, Perodua assembled cars for the Japanese brand provided on the Malaysian market. Perodua also managed to improve the safety of its cars. The 2019 Bezza was the first vehicle from its lineup to receive a five-star ASEAN (Asian NCAP) rating in crash-tests.

PEUGEOT,"Peugeot is actually one of the oldest brands on the car market today even if at first they didn't exactly make cars. The Peugeot business started out as a pepper, salt and coffee grinder manufacturer in 1842 and the way it ended up making cars is quite interesting: from making steel rods for crinoline dresses, it turned to umbrella frames, then wire wheels which seemed only a natural step towards bicycles. And once there, it was only a short distance from cars at the turn of the century when personal transportation was right in the middle of a revolution. The Peugeot name was a family business ever since the 1700s. The first one of the Peugeot family to become interested in automobile manufacturing was Armand Peugeot and soon after a meeting with Gottlieb Daimler, the first ever Peugeot car was born, a three-wheel steam-powered model which first came out in 1889. Just a year later steam was dropped in favor of petrol and the three-wheel model turned into a four-wheel version, using an engine under license from Daimler. Numbers steadily increased thanks to many innovations such as three-point suspension, sliding-gear transmission and the first rubber tire wheels. The Type 12 as they were called were even entered in races starting with 1894. In 1896 Peugeot started making its own engines, an 8 horse-power horizontal twin. That same year Peugeot broke off from the parent company ran by his brothers and set up the Societe Anonyme Des Automobiles Peugeot with a factory in Adincourt. By 1899 sales cars for Peugeot got up to 300, which is pretty decent considering that during that year only 1200 cars were sold in France. In 1903 Peugeot added motorcycles to his factory production. After a brief period out of racing, a Peugeot car managed to win the Indianapolis 500 with Jules Goux at the wheel in 1913. The success of the car was due to the introduction of the DOHC 4 valves per cylinder engine. As war dawned in Europe, Peugeot turned to making arms and military vehicles of course. The good thing about surviving the war was that cars were now becoming more of a necessity and less of a luxury which meant bigger sales for Peugeot. In 1929 the first 201 model was introduced, a way of numbering cars that would be trademarked by the French automaker. Having survived the depression, the company the tried in 1933 to woo buyers with a more aerodynamic look. The model that came out that year had a retractable hard top, an innovation that would be also picked up by Mercedes. During the Second World War, Peugeot fate took a turn for the worse as its factories were forced to build cars and weapons for the German war effort. By the end of the war, the plants were heavily bombed and in need of reparations. It would take the company until 1948 to resume car production with the 203 model. This was only the beginning as a new series of Italian-designed models by Pininfarina completed the line-up. The success of these cars determined Peugeot to start selling in the US too in 1958. By this time, Peugeot starting collaborating with other manufacturers such as Renault (1966) and Volvo (1972). In a bid to acquire a bigger share of the market, Peugeot bought 30% of Citroen in 1974, taking over completely in just two years which meant a change in the company's name, now the PSA (Peugeot Societe Anonyme). This partnership meant that the two brands could make use of each other's technical achievements but keep their independence design-wise. Further expansion of the PSA group saw the overtaking of the European division of Chrysler in 1978, an investment which proved faulty as most Chrysler facilities and machinery was old and worn out. These models were later sold under the Talbot brand. When sales began to go under, Peugeot decided to pull the plug on all models except the Arizona which became the 309 in 1986. During the 90s Peugeot got some of its old fame back after a series of miscalculations regarding the general direction of the company. The current model line-up is aiming towards a more luxurious market, with cost cuts no longer being made to sacrifice the overall look and feel of the car. Some wins in the racing world, including rallies and even Formula 1, have helped Peugeot with sales. Now Peugeot has developed several new model ranges, outside the classic 200, 300, 400 and 600 series. The 100 and 900 are the exact opposite, with the 100 eyeing the super compact range while 900 is not for the budget shoppers. The French automaker has even a hybrid vehicle in the make, a version of the 307.

PORSCHE,"Who hasn't heard of Porsche? In 2006 it won the most prestigious automobile brand for over 70 years of excellence and dedication to the four-wheel god. Established at first as a consulting and development company by Dr. Ing. Ferdinand Porsche in 1931, Porsche SE has since become synonymous with luxurious sports cars as well as cutting edge technology. Situated in downtown Stuttgart, Porsche's first contract of developing a people's car, a Volkswagen, appointed by the German government. The result was one of the most famous cars in history, one of the best sold and one of the most easily recognizable out there, the Beetle. Many features of the Beetle would find their place on the first ever Porsche, the 64, developed in 1939. During WWII the Porsche factory turned to making vehicles for the German Army, such as the Kubelwagen and the Schwimmwagen as well as contributing to the production of Tiger and Elefant tanks. After the war Ferdinand was imprisoned for war crimes for 20 months and was during that time that his son, Ferry Porsche, decided to build a new car to suit his needs – the 356. The success of the 356 and the death of Ferdinand Porsche in 1951 gave Ferry the confidence to follow in his father's footsteps and continue designing cars. One of his most famous designs was the Spyder 550, a car that would prove very successful in races. By now, the general line of the company seemed evident, as in 1964 another sporty model, the 911, another car with a air-cooled, boxer, rear-mounted engine. The design team for this car was led by Ferry's oldest son, Ferdinand Alexander Porsche. this car would take the legacy of the 550 Spyder even further, winning races and rallies. Testimony to the success of the 911 is the fact that it's still in production today, despite being heavily modified. Porsche was going to change its status in 1972 from a limited partnership to a public limited company, which meant that now Porsche would be run by a board of directors supervised by family members. In 1974, at the Paris Auto Show, Porsche unveils the new 911 Turbo, with exhaust turbocharger and pressure regulator. When the 924 was entered in production in 1975, Porsche took a leap of faith because it had not experienced with front-mounted engines for a long time. By Porsche standards, the 928 was an oddity, with its front-mounted V8 engine made out of  metal alloy. Then, in 1981, a new transaxle model is added to the Porsche line-up, the 944. The high-performance Porsche 959 is unveiled at the Frankfurt Auto Show in 1985. It will go on to win a lot of races and rallies, the best known  being the Paris-Dakar. A new technological leap was made in 1988 when the 911 Carrera 4 with all-wheel drive was introduced on the market. Then, in 1989, the “Tiptronic” automatic gearbox system is fitted on Porsches. In 1991, Porsche becomes the first car manufacturer to fit driver and passenger airbags on all its models. The Boxter model is introduced in 1996 after 3 and a half years of development. That same year, Porsche celebrates 1million units being produced. Two years later, Ferry Porsche dies at the age of 88 but the company moves on and has a great season at Le Mans with the 911 GT1, coming in first and second. This was going to be only the beginning for Porsche, which continued with the very sporty and high-performance models Boxster S and the Carrera GT in 2000. In 2002 Porsche entered the SUV market with the unconventional Cayenne and its later versions, the Cayenne Turbo and Turbo S. The next model on the line-up for Porsche, announced for 2009 is the Panamera, a four-door sedan. With this new model, Porsche seems set to take on a whole new market, directly competing with other luxury brands such as Mercedes, BMW and Audi.

RENAULT,"A business started by 3 brothers in France in 1899, has turned decades later into a very profitable business, considering that now Renault is the 4th largest automaker in the world thanks to its partnership with Nissan. The brainchild of an enthusiastic engineer named Louis Renault, the company was created in association with his two brothers who ran the financial side while he took care of the “mechanics”. From the very beginning, Louis managed to show innovation when he invented and later patented a direct drive system on his De Dion-Bouton tricycle which he already turned into a four-wheel vehicle. Louis also understood that it would be only through racing that he would make the Renault name known to the world so he entered his vehicles in city-to-city races where his brothers acted as drivers. A number of victories earned them the notoriety they were searching for. People watching the races made orders despite the fact the cars were expensive for the time. The company quickly developed and set up shop by the Seine. The model line-up now had several models, including the first saloon in 1902. That was also the year that Louis designed his first engine, a four-cylinder, which gave out 24 HP. In 1903, Marcel, one of the Renault brothers died in the Paris to Madrid race in a crash, a hard blow both for the company and for Louis who would now assign professional drivers to race for Renault. Instead, he focused on bringing Renault carts to more European markets and even over to the Americas. As the gap between the United States and Europe widened because of the war and the economic crash, Renault sought to improve production and to lower costs. After the economic crisis, he wanted to become more autonomous and started buying all sorts of businesses that provided him with the materials and parts needed to make cars. He also modernized the factory, emulating Ford and his plant, introducing assembly plants in 1922. During the economic crash of the 30s, all car manufacturers had to suffer and Renault was no exception. The company was forced to cut costs, reduce staff and become more efficient in production. That's why it started expanding into other areas, basically building anything with a motor attached to it. Busses, lorries, electric railcars, tractors and even airplane engines, all were now coming out of the Renault plant. With worker strikes plaguing all of the country, Renault was nationalized by the government in 1945 in order to keep it from going bankrupt like Citroen had done some years before. The first project made by the new company was the small 4CV, but it was postponed until after WWII. For the European market, small cars were the future because they were cheap to buy and maintain. The 4CV, introduced in 1946, proved to be a major success, much larger than initially expected. With the money the company made from sales, it bought and developed heavy machinery to help with production. Renault then turned again to the heavy goods sector and by merging two existent companies, Latil and Somua, they created a new company, completely dedicated to making trucks – Saviem. As the 4CV aged, a new model was ready to surface, the Dauphine, which appeared in 1956. It too enjoyed great success, even in the US. In fact, it was so successful over the ocean that Renault had to setup a special transport company, CAT, to accommodate the high demand. Next, the Renault 4 and the Renault 8 took over where the Dauphine left off in 1961. Renault started the 70s with another success, the sportier and more agile Renault 5, which owed its favorable welcome to its fuel efficiency during the oil crisis. But this didn't mean that the company was safe during these turbulent times. In a bid to retake the American market, Renault started assembling Rambler complete knock down kits and marketing them as Renault Ramblers. Also during the 70s, Renault began expanding its influence and opened up plants in Eastern Europe, Africa and even Australia. The partnership with the American AMC company came in 1979. At the beginning of the 80s, Renault found itself in financial trouble again and the chairman of the company at the time decided to pul the company out of racing altogether, as well as selling all non-essential assets and cutting costs left and right. The good news was that by 1987 the company began turning the balance in favor of profit, so that at the beginning of the 90s, a whole new line-up was released on the market and all models proved successful: the new Clio, the new Espace, Twingo and the Laguna. The 1995 Renault Megane was the first car ever to achieve a four-star rating at the Euro NCAP safety tests. Also during the 90s, Renault returned to Formula 1 racing and with success nonetheless, having won the Championship in 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997. In 1996 it was decided that a state-owned status of the company would not benefit in the long run so it was privatized again. Renault made further investments in Brazil, Argentina and Turkey. After 2000, it launched a series of less successful vehicles like the Avantime and the Vel Satis, but also continued successfully with older series like the Clio, Laguna and Megane. Now the government owns 15,7% of the company, which has since bought Romanian car manufactures Dacia and the South Korean Samsung not to mention 20% of Volvo (latest rumors say that Renault is interesting in a total buy out).

RIMAC,"Rimac stormed the automotive world in 2011 when it unveiled the Concept One at the Frankfurt Motor Show. It was the fastest accelerating electric vehicle in 2013 when it came out on the market. But the story of this Croatian carmaker started a few years before, when Mate Rimac, the owner of the company, decided to go full-electric with his BMW E30 drift car. Mate Rimac established the company in 2009 and started developing an electric powertrain for his car, but he achieved more than that. With a team of friends, he began to create a 600 PS (593 hp) electric version of the BMW, and the result was stunning. The car, named ""Green Monster,"" achieved five records in FIA-sanctioned acceleration events in 2011. This gained a lot of attention, and soon investors started to pour money into the Rimac company, which helped him unveil the first concept car. The idea was to build 88 products, but in the end, it lowered that figure to just eight. Nothing was bought from the shelves. Instead, everything was custom-built by the small Croatian team. His team's ideas were converted into patents sold to other carmakers who had already started developing electric cars. But Mate and his team didn't lose focus on creating a Croatian hypercar. Instead, they did a surprising marketing stunt by advertising the company with the Concept One model as an official vehicle for the first Formula E championship in 2014. Later on, by advancing into developments and with secured funding after selling the first eight vehicles, Rimac evolved into a supplier for big carmakers in the industry such as Hyundai or Porsche. The evolution continued, and, in 2018, Porsche bought 10% of the Croatian carmaker and pushed them into the world arena under the spotlights. Moreover, the evolution led to more people coming into the company. By 2020, there were already 1,000 employees who were either developing or building the next vehicle, the Nevera. Just remember that Rimac was a small garage shop that fitted an old BMW with an electric powertrain developed from scratch one decade before. With the Nevera, Rimac made the final step into the world of hypercars manufacturers. It was developed from scratch. Even some tools were invented for this hypercar that managed to be the fastest production vehicle on Earth, independently tested by various journalists. But the story didn't end there. In 2021, Rimac got a 55% stake in Bugatti, while Audi held 45% in the new joint-venture named Bugatti Rimac. Thus, not only the Rimac brand was secured, but also further developments for the French brand were granted. By 2022, despite the drawbacks caused by the world pandemic, Rimac started delivering the Nevera hypercar, threatening other, more famous brands worldwide.

ROLLS-ROYCE,"What's more luxurious and opulent than a Rolls Royce? Well, nothing else really, except maybe gold-plated Porsche, but since they don't have a whole line of those yet, people tend to stick to Rolls Royces. Born out of the partnership between Charles Stewart Rolls and Frederick Henry Royce, the company started out in 1906 in Britain. Right from the start, they set out to build “the best car in the world” as the Silver Ghost was named. Attention to detail and outstanding performance meant that the Silver Ghost enjoyed success right from its launch in 1906. As with many other car manufacturers, during the First World War, Rolls Royce was turned to war production, but instead of building cars, they build airplane engines like the Eagle which was used by half of of the Allied fighters. After the war, the company continued research in the engine department and came up with the “R” engine which was used in planes and cars to set new world records. Post war developed cars include the Phantom I and the Phantom II increasing production. Because the demand increased, Rolls Royce had to open up a second plant in America, in Massachusetts. Another successful move was the acquisition of Bentley in 1931 which would later prove beneficial for both brands. For a long time Rolls Royces and Bentleys would be mechanically identical. The R engine was eventually developed into the praised Merlin engine. It was during the Second World War that the Merlin really proved itself, as all Hurricanes, Lancasters and Spitfires involved in the Battle for Britain would be fitted with such engines. Royce would not live to see the success of his engine as he died in 1933, aged 70. Car production resumed at Rolls Royce after the conflagration and, as sales were increasing steadily, the company opened up new plants in Crewe, Chesire along the one in Derby. The former would become the company's formal home starting with 1946. Models from this period include the Silver Wraith, the last car to have its body built by an independent coachbuilder. After this, all Rolls royce cars would be built completely in-house. The 40s and 50s were prosperous times for the Rolls Royce company and that is why, in 1966, the manufacturer decided to further expand its influence and buy out Bristol Siddeley, the other great aero engine manufacturer in Britain. In 1950 the Phantom IV, the most exclusive Rolls Royce ever was introduced. Only 18 cars were produced and all were delivered to royalty and heads of state. The Silver Cloud I and II also hail from this period, followed in the 60s by the Silver Cloud III and Phantom VI. Starting with the 70s, Rolls Royce comes to a period of financial decline, owned in part to a failed contract to complete a new jet engine, the RB211. The government had to step in and in 1971 the company was nationalized but that didn't solve the problem. In 1973 the air and car industries were split by the government and the latter sold in order to keep the airplane industry rolling. Rolls Royce Motors was bought in 1980 by Vickers PLC. The Silver Spirit Rolls Royce was developed in 1981, the first car under the new brand. It followed a whole new line, aimed at a younger market and it was much safer and met the emissions regulations. The Vickers takeover would end in the 90s, as the company was put up for sale again. The omst likely buyer seemed to be the Germans over at BMW, as they already had some ties with Rolls Royce, providing parts for Bentley cars. But at the last minute they were outbid by Volkswagen, which brought things into an awkward situation. VW had rights to the Spirit of ecstasy mascot and the shape of the radiator grille, but BMW held the rights to the double R logo and the name of the brand. The two companies arrived at an understanding since VW really wanted Bentley and decided to sell the right for the mascot to BMW for 40 million pounds. Staring with January 2003, the two brands, Rolls Royce and Bentley, which went a long way back would be now separated, Bentleys being produced by volkswagen and Rolls Royces by BMW. That was also the year Rolls Royce launched the new Phantom, a car which has managed to draw out the new direction of the company for the coming century. Purveyors of probably the most luxurious cars on the planet. Rolls-Royce offers vast, lavish, impossibly comfortable land yachts to the sort of customers who light their Cuban cigars with £50 notes. Now owned by BMW, but retaining an ethos as British as cucumber sandwiches. If you like your cars compact and unobtrusive, you need not apply. If you don’t already own at least a couple of yachts and a helicopter, you need not apply.","Luxurious, Opulent, Lavish, Comfort, Prestigious, Exclusive, Expensive, British","Luxurious, Opulent, Lavish, Impossibly comfortable, Vast, Prestigious, Exclusive, Expensive, British"
SEAT,"Sociedad Espagnola de Automoviles de Turismo or Seat for short is the biggest car manufacturer to come out of Spain. The company started out in 1950 with the help of the Instituto Nacional de Industria and Fiat. That's why at first, Seat were simply rebadged and slightly modified Fiats. They even kept the names. For instance, the Seat Panda was based on the Fiat Panda and so was the Seat 600, on the Fiat 600. The first model Seat however, was the the Seat 1400, which began production in 1953. Soon, they turned to making and exporting Seats to Colombia in 1965. By 1968, Seat had reached its first million cars in production and by 1974 its second million. But however big the Spanish manufacturer became, it needed the expertise and funds of a much bigger and older car producer. Especially since Fiat pulled out of the deal in 1981. This time Seat would turn to Germany for a partner and it would find it in Volkswagen, with who it signed a deal in 1982. That same year, the first “Fiat free” car appeared, named the Seat Ronda. Basically, it was a restyled Fiat Ritmo, a fact which didn't bode well with the Italians who were quick to take the matter to court. In order to settle the dispute, Seat president at the time, Juan Miguel Antonanzas showed in a press conference a Fiat Ritmo and a Seat Ronda side by side, with the Seat having painted in bright yellow all the parts that were differences from the “donor car”. In 1984 the first Ibiza model rolled out of the factory at Zona Franca, based on the Volkswagen Polo. The partnership with Volkswagen was soon going to become a lot tighter as in 1986 the German automaker was going to purchase 51% of Seat shares in June and then  go up to 75% byt the end of that year. Just 4 years later Volkswagen is going to go all the way and buy the whole of Seat, owning 99,99% of its shares. The first Seat model after the acquisition was the Toledo, unveiled in 1991. The new Ibiza and the Cordoba are developed in 1993, as Seat celebrates the opening of a new plant at Martorell. 1995 sees the 10th million Seat being produced. The event is celebrated by having the car roll out of the assembly line driven by the Prince of Asturias. A new face for Seat is being concocted, as new models are being introduced: the Alhambra in 1996, the new Toledo in 1998 and the rally-ready Ibiza WRC and Cordoba WRC with which Seat attains several titles. As the new century rolls in, the company follows a new line in branding and marketing, more aggressive and more innovative. The Leon Cupra and the new Cordoba introduced in 2002. That same year a reorganization within the Volkswagen group sees Seat join the Audi Brand Group. The VW family’s Spanish offshoot. From its headquarters just outside Barcelona, Seat cooks up a wide range of cars that share much of their DNA with their Volkswagen and Skoda counterparts, though often with a soupcon more sharpness in both the design and handling departments. Performance badge Cupra has now broken free as its own performance marque.","Rebadged, Modified, Restyled, Innovative, Sharp","Sporty, Aggressive, Innovative, Sharp, Performance, Handling, Design, Branding"
SKODA,"Based in the Czech Republic, Skoda Automobile was created by a disgruntled bookstore owner and his brother and started out as a bicycle repair shop in 1895. Vaclav Laurin and his brother started the business when they couldn't get their German bikes fixed due to lack of parts. They decided to call the company Slavia from a patriotic urge. Later, it was changed to Laurin & Klement  Co. and it started making motorcycles. After several victories in local races, the two bothers decided to export their motorcycles to London. Based on the success of the first model, Voiturette A, Laurin and Klement expanded into automobile making starting with 1905. By that time they were established as a big company both locally and internationally. The First World War meant that the factory was now engaged in war production but as soon as it was over, the company resumed car production. In 1924 they made a merge with Skoda Works, an industrial conglomerate and started making trucks. This is the moment that all products came out with the Skoda name. The Second World War brought the German occupation which put Skoda in the position of producing to support the nazi war effort. Civilian production was at first limited and then halted altogether. After the war, the company was affected by the nationalization program ran by the government and became known as the AZNP enterprise in 1946. The only benefit was that it obtained the monopoly of passenger car making. Models from this period include the 1101 series (an updated version of the Skoda Popular), the 440 Spartak, 445 Octavia, Felicia and 1000 MB. As time passed, Skoda lost contact with the West which caused a break in development. Soon, most Skoda models became outdated and as other car companies increased in sales and models, Skoda was strictly controlled by the state. Only after the economic crisis of the 70s did Skoda manage to gain somewhat of success with the new Skoda Favorit in the 1987. This model designed by the Italian company Bertone and having Western engine technology sold remarkably well in Eastern Europe and in the UK as well, being known that Skodas were generally reliable cars. As the communist regime fell throughout Europe, the Czechoslovak  government set new market economy conditions, which allowed Skoda to search for a foreign partner to help it grow. In december of 1990 Skoda became associated with Volkswagen Group, and became effective on April 16th 1991. With German technology by its side, Skoda managed to increase the quality of its cars and has since become a major player in the European car market. Recent trends have seen the Czech automaker move into a slightly more luxurious market with the Superb and the Octavia. The company is also trying to secure other segments of the market with the 2006 MPV called Roomster and a crossover concept called the Yeti. Not so long ago, the butt of many a bad comedian’s joke. Now one of the most respected car makers out there. As the Czech wing of the Great Volkswagen Empire, Skoda churns out some seriously professional, practical and reliable cars nowadays (with plenty of VW/Seat/Audi genetic material under the skin) along a few more esoteric offerings from time to time.","Reliable, Professional, Practical, Luxurious","Reliable, Professional, Practical, Luxurious, Esoteric"
SMART,"What's smaller than a Mini? Why a Smart, of course. Small enough to weasel in and out traffic downtown during rush hour, very fuel efficient, very easy to park and still stylish enough to be wanted by the posh people. That's what Swiss watch makers Swatch and Daimler AG had in mind when they designed the Smart. The Smart's story begins somewhere in Switzerland where Swatch CEO Nicolas Hayek decided that he wanted a car to bear the company's name, a “Swatchmobile” (Smart actually stands for Swatch Mercedes Art) so they contacted Volkswagen but the German company was struggling with financial troubles at the time and had to pass on the offer. It was Daimler Benz who finally decided to greenlight the project. In order to make the car, a new factory was built in a place names Smartville in Hambach, France in 1994. Everything seemed promising at first but soon Swatch and Mercedes entered a conflict over design and overall performances of the future car. So, before the car was even done, Swatch pulled out, leaving Mercedes to complete the project. Sales started in 1998 and proved promising at first because the Smart had stirred a lot of enthusiasm from people in al 9 countries it was being sold. Confident in the model, Mercedes launched two more Smarts, the Roadster and the Roadster Coupe in 2003. In 2004, the Forfour, a slightly bigger Smart came on the market. These later models were not received as well as their predecessors and many customers weren't impressed by the design and considered them too expensive. Daimler lost a ton of money of the project (4 billion euros between 2003 and 2006 according to sources) and so decided to pull the plug on most of the models. The Forfour and the Roadster found their demise during that move and the Fortwo (the old City-Coupe) was redesigned just to be able to stay on the market. They made it slightly bigger and gave it an interior make-over but they didn't solve the problem with the controversial sequential transmission that had a notorious lag. When you think about it, the whole car is rather controversial. You either hate it or you love it, there's no way you can be indifferent, it's that kind of car. Mercedes offshoot that specialises in small, clever city cars. Smart’s offerings are just the ticket if you want to scoot across, say, central Tokyo in rush hour, and are very much not just the ticket if you want to get an old wardrobe to the municipal tip.","Stylish, Small, Clever, Controversial","Stylish, Small, Clever, Controversial, City, Rush hour, Fuel efficient, Easy to park, Specialises, Smart, Slightly bigger, Interior make-over, Sequential transmission"
SPYKER,"It's safe to say that car makers Spyker have come a long way from the original idea of the two brothers, coachbuilders in Amsterdam, who founded the company back in 1898. But the basic idea stays the same: make quality cars that are also innovative. But the Spyker company we know today has gone one major transformation from its beginning. Not many people know the comopany founded by Jacobus and Hendrik-Jan Spijker in 1898 went bankrupt in 1922, despite efforts to make it profitable. Despite this, Spyker was known at the time for making reliable cars that were regarded as the “Rolls Royce of the continent”. The 1903 60/80 HP was a very innovative car for its time, with a 6-cylinder engine , four wheel drive and brakes on all 4 wheels. Another very interesting invention was a patented dust shield which was fitted under the car in order to help it from stirring dust on dirt roads. Spyker cars made history when they completed the grueling Pekin to Paris marathon, arriving in second place. By this time, the company had already established a name for itself. During WWI, the company began producing airplanes and airplane engines in order to stay in business. After the war, car production resumed but Spyker went bankrupt in 1922, being bought by a British distributor. Finally, when all the money ran out, the factory closed its doors for good in 1929. But the brand and what it stood for remained deeply embedded on the car industry. That's why at the turn of the century, in 2000, Victor Muller and Maarten de Brujin founded a new company bearing the Spyker name, determined to carry on the legacy of the Dutch automaker. The new Spyker builds flashy and exclusive sports cars like the C8 Spyder and the C8 Laviolette. Production continued in 2005 with the Spyker C12 LaTurbie and in 2007 with the D12 and C12 Zagato. Their cars were briefly featured on the F1 circuit in the 207 season, equipped with Ferrari engines.

SUBARU,"Subaru actually means “unite” and it refers to the six stars on the logo that stand for the 6 companies that are united under the FHI group. The largest of the stars represents Fuji Heavy Industries. The company started out in 1917 in Japan as a aircraft research laboratory but soon moved to producing airplanes. After WWII, the company created a scooter, the Fuji Rabbit with the spare parts from airplanes. Pretty soon, the company split up into different business that manufactured scooters, coaches, engines and chassis. Then CEO Kenji Kita decided that it would be a good idea to get involved in car making and pretty soon the first Subaru car was created, the Subaru 1500 (1954). The 1500 or P1 was followed by the 360 in 1958, the Sambar in 1961, the 1000 in 1965, gthe 1100 and the R2 in 1969. During the 70s, the Leone came out and then later, in the 80s, the Alcyclone (1985) and the Legacy (1989) were added to the Subaru line-up. Slowly, in the 90s, the company moved away from the manufacture of small vehicles and concentrated on rally cars, such as the Vivio and Impreza. Different versions of the Impreza WRX won the world championship several times under drivers such as Colin McRae. Using the technology from the aeronautical industry, Subaru employed many successful inventions in the automotive industry. One of the first was the us of horizontally opposed “boxer” engines as well as the use of monocoque construction. Also, Subaru is the only car manufacturer to offer all-wheel drive as a standard on most of its models. The Japanese manufacturer was also the first to introduce electronic continuously variable transmission (ECTV) which replaces standard gears and gives smooth acceleration while reducing emissions and fuel consumption. Subaru also takes a keen interest in environmental protection, having achieved an odd  record: 0 landfill status for their plant in Lafayette, Indiana which means that the factory generates no trash. Also, the company has an extensive recycling program for its own cars, not to mention the program for hybrid and fuel efficient cars. Japanese veteran that, for better or worse, refuses to follow the crowd. Arguably most famous for its glorious Impreza rally cars of the Nineties, Subarus have long eschewed cutting-edge infotainment and squishy luxury in favour of a more… agricultural vibe.","Innovation, Rally, Four Wheel Drive, Unique","Innovative, All-wheel drive, Environmentally conscious, Rally cars, Agricultural vibe, Boxer engines, Continuous variable transmission"
SUZUKI,"Michio Suzuki, the founder of the Suzuki company, started pretty much like Toyota, in the textile industry, producing automated looms in 1909 in a small seacoast village called Hamamatsu. For years, his company was successful, but as time passed, Suzuki realized that he will have to diversify if he wanted to stay in business. He turned to car making and in 1937 started developing a prototype. Unlike Toyota, who chose to copy an American six-cylinder engine, Suzuki created their own model, a four-cylinder version which put out 13 horsepower. But as WWII began, production of passenger cars became a luxury so Suzuki turned back to loom-making to support Japan's new cotton industry. All that stopped when the market crashed in 1951. Versatile and ingenious, Suzuki now turned to making engines for bicycles. Unlike other engines that could be mounted to bikes, his motors had a unique feature that allowed the rider to pedal assisted by the engine or completely disconnect the pedals. This captured the attention of the government who granted funds to Suzuki for research. During the 50s Suzuki released several models: in 1955 the Suzulight SS, a-2 door sedan, the Suzulight SD, a 2-door wagon, the SL – a 3 door sedan and the SP, a pick-up. Out of all of them, the SP proved to be the most successful, being mass-produced and improved during the 60s. Good sales for the SP which was regarded asa commercial type of vehicle, meant that in 1960 the Suzulight Van, the TL, was introduced. Other models from the 60s include the small Suzuki Fronte 360 and the Suzuki Fronte 500. The famous off-road Jimny came in 1970, which had several variations of chassis and engine. The other cars from the 70s are the Cervo, Alto and the Fronte, also with a number of variations and improvements along the years. As the 80s rolled in, Suzuki began expanding across the ocean, thanks to a business agreement with GM (in 1981) which gave them an important niche in the western market. Also, they began a partnership with the Indian car company Maruti in 1983 to produce cars there. A year later, in 1984, Suzuki Motor GmbH Deutchland opens up its doors in Heppenheim, Germany. The Swift and the Vitara models were introduced in the late 80s and Suzuki reached a production of 10 million units. During the 90s, the company continued to expand with factories all over the world and several other 4x4 models were introduced. Right now, Suzuki is listed as being the 12th biggest automotive manufacturer in the world with 35 production facilities all over the Globe and being present in 192 countries.

TOYOTA,"Toyota Jidosha Kabushiki-gaisha or Toyota for short is actually the largest car maker in the entire world, bigger than Ford, GM and anyone else. Their history, like many other car producers, starts with some other product, in this case automatic looms. At some point, in 1933, Kiichiro Toyoda, son to Toyota's founder, decided he wanted to build cars and so he took a trip to Europe to get an idea about gas-powered engines. The government encouraged such a bold decision mostly because making their own cars would be cheaper and they also needed vehicles for the war with China. Just a year after its foundation in 1933, the Toyota Motor Company created its first engine, the Type A, placed in the Model A1 passenger car and the G1 truck. During WWII, Toyota was committed to making trucks for the army and only the premature ending of the conflict saved the company's factories in Aichi from a scheduled Allied bomb raid. After the war, Toyota resumed car making but found more success in building trucks and buses than with cars. Still, it didn't give up on cars for good and in 1947 it came up with the Model SA, also known as the Toyopet, a name which later was applied to other models as well. A little more successful was the Model SF which also had a taxi version but the same 27 horsepower engine as its predecessor. A more powerful model, the RH, which had 48 HP came out shortly after. Production went up rather fast and by 1955, Toyota was turning out 8400 cars a year. That year, Toyota diversified their production, adding the Jeep-like Land Cruiser and the luxury sedan, the Crown. With numbers growing and with several models under their belt, Toyota now had its eyes set on the international market. The first dealership outside Japan was in America in 1957 an the first plant in Brazil in 1959. An interesting strategy from Toyota ensured that all models were somehow unique to the region where they were produced (they were adapted to the respective market). The big break for Toyota on the American market came with the 70s when rising gas prices forced local producers to make smaller cars. These were thought of as entry-level and as a consequence lacked in quality of finishings. In contrast, Toyota already had several fuel-efficient models that were also of better quality. The Corolla is the best example in this sense, soon becoming America's favorite compact car. But as far as the luxury market went, Toyota still had trouble with selling the Crown and the Cressida. At the dawn of the 80s, the entire luxury market in America was entering a downwards slope, with all the other manufacturers finding it difficult to keep up sales, and that's when Toyota came up with Lexus, a new company that would make luxury cars. By the beginning of the 90s, Toyota vehicles became synonymous with reliability and low-cost maintenance which made them very popular all over the world. A bid for winning over the younger audience was made with the launch of models like the MR2 and the Celica. Presently, Toyota is at the forefront of the environmental battle, with its successful hybrid model, the Toyota Prius and now announcing a plug-in electric car that will be called Toyota Plug-in HV, which will run on standard electricity powered by a lithium-ion battery pack. One of the world’s biggest car companies.

TVR,"For the car afficionados TVR stands for extremely powerful engines bolted on ridiculously light and awesome looking carbon fiber bodies. It's the exception from the rule when it comes British car manufacturing, the touch of exotic in an otherwise conservative medium. That's exactly what founder Trevor Wilkinson was thinking about when he started the company in 1947 in Blackpool, Lancastershire. TVR actually is derived from his name, TreVoR and was initially set up to repair and sell cars, but after Wilkinson built his first car by modifying the body on an Alvis Firebird chassis he paired with Jack Pritchard and starting making sports cars. In the beginning, they used existing engines (from BMC or Ford) which severely limited performances for their cars, but at least they made up with great body designs out of fiber-glass and tubular steel frames. The first official TVR model was the Mk 1, later Grantura in 1954. For a long period of time, TVR cars came in kit form in order to exploit a loophole in the tax law, but during the 70s that loophole was fixed and so the cars now came fully assembled. The original owners, Pritchard and Wilkinson left the company in 1962 to set up a new business venture, this time in fiber-glass engineering. The company passed a period of disarray, but it came back strong with the TVR Griffith, named so after the American motor dealer Jack Griffith who thought of sticking a powerful AC Cobra V8 engine into his TVR Grantura. This car would help TVR get back into the game. In 1965, the company changed management again, this time by a TVR shareholder, Martin Lilley who decided to bring a higher level of finishing to the brand. Under his leadership, TVR came up with the first model in the Tuscan series. The other new car he created was the 1968 Vixen, based on the aging Grantura. Now having a series of quality products, TVR sought to improve on performance and introduced the M Series chassis that would turn out to be a big hit over in the US. What they still had to borrow was the engine, which throughout the 70s came from Triumphs and Fords. As the 80s dawned, Peter Wheeler came to be manager of TVR and it was he that first introduced turbochargers on TVR engines (at the time TVR was using a Rover V8). Slowly, the need for more powerful engines led to heavy modifications being made to the Rover engine and finally, in the 90s, TVR came up with its own model engine, called the AJP8. The car's bodies would also undergo several important changes under Peter Wheeler. With the turn of the century, and the sale of TVR to Nikolay Smolensky in 2004. Due to drop in demand, a number of employees were let go and headquarters were rumored to move to Turin, Italy. This sparked outrage among fans and customers who rallied in a protest in London. For a while it seemed that the company would close its doors for good, but earlier this year they announced that it would be relaunching a new version of the Sagaris, the Sagaris 2.

VAUXHALL,"Despite the fact that it's not one of the most famous brands on the automotive market out there today, British car makers Vauxhall actually enjoy a long history that goes back to 1857, when it was founded by Alex Wilson as a company that built pumps and marine engines. It wouldn't be until 1903 that Vauxhall would build its first car, equipped with a 5 HP engine with 2 forward gears but no reverse. Gradually, Vauxhall Motors as it became known in 1907 began producing more and more cars that were thought of as sporty back then. Soon after the end of the first World War, the company was bought by GM in 1925 and from then on Vauxhall took on a more “American” feel to the way in which they made cars. When WWII hit, production in the factories of Vauxhall turned to making Churchill tanks (some 5600 units). After the war, the entire car-making process saw a mass-market orientation in order to help the company grow. But in their haste to make more cars, Vauxhall actually cut a few corners when it came to quality and thus acquired a bad reputation that their cars were rust-ridden, which was actually unfair since many producers suffered of the same problem at the time. Regardless, this reputation was going to haunt them until the 80s, despite all efforts to make their cars rust-proof. The biggest step in the company's history was going to be their partnership with Opel that started in the 70s. From then on, most of the cars Vauxhall produced were going to be restyled Opel models, like the Kadett, Ascona and Rekord which translated into the Chevette, Cavalier and Carlton respectively in the UK factory. The difference between the German cars and the British ones was a sloping front end, but as time passed, not even that made the difference. Soon, Vauxhalls would be practically Opel cars with the griffin emblem on them. At first, Opels and Vauxhalls were sold through the UK together, but then Opel dealerships closed down in England. As a result, even the names of the two brands were standardized. However, Vauxhall did retain a note of originality because from 1994, all the front grilles on Vauxhalls had a distinctive V under the badge. Also, there is a car that is unique to Vauxhall, the Monaro coupe also known as the Australian Holden, the American Pontiac GTO and the Asian Chevrolet Lumina. Although faced with a wave of consumer dissatisfaction back in the UK, Vauxhall managed to reduce the gap between them and Ford with the launch of the 2004 Astra and become one of  the most important car manufacturers in Britain. Long-established British brand that’s now part of the Stellantis empire. Despite a history spanning twelve decades, and a product range that spans pretty much everything mass-market – badged Opel elsewhere in the world – Vauxhall has, in recently memory, struggled to get itself noticed, despite the Corsa perennially sitting among the UK’s best-sellers.  Claims to have built the world’s first sports car in the shape of 1911’s ‘Prince Henry’. Other manufacturers may dispute this claim.","Sporty, Mass-market","Sporty, Long-established, Mass-market, British, Originality, Partnership, Restyled, Griffin emblem, Opel, Stellantis, Unique, Corsa, Best-sellers, History, Product range, Struggled"
VOLKSWAGEN,"The history of the “People's Car”, Volkswagen, begins on May 28th 1937 when the “Geselschaft zur Vorbereitung des Deutschen Volkswagen mbH” company is created. A year later it is renamed into “Volkswagenwerk GmbH” has it's headquarters established in Wolfsburg, a city especially created for the workers on the Volkswagen plant that are going to mass produce Hitler's dream car for the average German, designed by Ferdinand Porsche. But Hitler's plans weren't going to materialize because WWII started and the plant switched production to armaments and the vehicles under the VW logo went to the army of the Third Reich. After the war, the plant at Wolfsburg went under Allied control, British to be specific, and under the supervision of Major Ivan Hirst, Volkswagen began the mass production of the Type 1, or the Beetle as it would come to be known throughout the world. Initial sales abroad were disastrous, but through clever advertising, the Beetle gained popularity with the young crowd and from 1945 to 1955 numbers reached the 1 million mark. Meanwhile, sometime at the end of the 40s, Volkswagen also introduced the Type 2, a people carrier, known as the “VW Bully”. Even through the 60s and 70s, the Beetle manages to stay on top of sales, despite the fact that it was becoming obsolete. Reliability, easy maintenance and reduced fuel consumption made the car remain a consumer favorite. On February 17th 1972, Volkswagen celebrated selling over 15 million units of the Beetle sold, thus surpassing the Ford Model T as the most popular car in the world, a title which it still holds to this day. Despite the success it had with the Beetle, by the beginning of the 70s, Volkswagen AG was in dire need of new models to replace the aging Beetle. The help came from Audi/Auto Union, which WV had bought back in the sixties. They brought with them the knowledge for front-wheel drive vehicles and water-cooled engines. In 1974, the first Golf rolls out of the factory's door and becomes and instant hit. Marketed as the Rabbit in the United States and Canada, it was responsible for putting Volkswagen back on the map. That same year, a more sporty model, the Scirocco makes it's way onto the Volkswagen line up. For the smaller car market, the German car maker came up with the Polo in 1976, which was quite popular throughout Western Europe. The next decade saw Volkswagen trying to improve their products with new generations of all the older models and expanding their influence by taking over Spanish manufacturer Seat and the Czech-based Skoda Auto. As the 90s rolled in, VW-owned Audi became a direct competitor for BMW and Mercedes-Benz with products designed for a more pretentious market. This left a void in the general market which Volkswagen now tried to fill. The third generation vehicles now came with better quality and standards. Gradually, new luxury models were introduced, like the Touareg, a premium off-road vehicle. In the last decade, Volkswagen has been busy trying to set records when it comes to CO2 emissions and fuel-efficient technologies. This applies to their normal engines, running on gas and diesel, but they are also developing hybrids. You’ve probably heard of this lot. Founded in 1937, this German car giant has arguably done more to shape the make-up of our roads than any other manufacturer, in the shape of the Beetle, the Golf and a whole bunch of other genre-defining offerings. Also arguably invented the hot hatch with the Golf GTI in 1976 for good measure, too. Now hitting electric in a big way.","Iconic, Reliability, Easy Maintenance, Fuel-efficient, Innovation","Iconic, Innovative, Influential, Reliable, Premium, Fuel-efficient, Genre-defining, Electric"
VOLVO,"AB Volvo is a world-leading Swedish manufacturer of commercial vehicles, trucks, buses and construction equipment, drive systems for marine and industrial applications, aerospace components and financial services. But it did start out as a car manufacturer, founded by Assar Gabrielsson and Gustaf Larsson. The main purpose of the company was to produce the safest cars possible, following the death of Assar's wife in a car crash. The automaker was founded April 14, 1927 in the city of Gothenburg, as a spin-off from roller ball bearing maker SKF (Svenska Kullagerfabriken AB). The name Volvo was originally registered in May 1915 as a separate company within SKF AB and as a registered trademark with the intention to be used for a special series of ball bearing, but this idea was only used for a short period of time and SKF decided to use ""SKF"" as the trademark for all its bearing products. Volvo AB began to function on the 10th of August 1926 when the SKF Sales Manager Assar Gabrielsson and Engineer Gustav Larson, started production of 10 prototypes and set up the car-manufacturing business Volvo AB within SKF group. Volvo AB was introduced at the Stockholm stock exchange in 1935 and SKF then decided to sell its shares in the company. The first series produced Volvo automobile, called 'ÖV4' left the factory on 14 April 1927. Just 996 cars were produced between 1927-1929. 'ÖV4' was replaced by model PV651 in April 1929. Its success on the market helped Volvo buy out their engine manufacturer and thus become a serious car producer. By 1931, it was already returning its first dividend to shareholders. After it reached a production milestone of 10,000 cars in May 1932, Volvo then targeted a new demographic segment, aiming to make their cars cheaper, a car “for the people”. This was going to be the PV 51 which came out in 1936 which was a smaller version of the PV36. The PV444 was one of the most significant cars of the war era, the first true small car, a mixture of American flair and European size, it {ad}would become a resonant success and the best sold model throughout the 60s. The P1800 was Volvo's first sports car, made in the early 60s and it was so popular that it was featured in the hit TV series “The Saint” starring Roger Moore. Safety and quality were still paramount for Volvo and that's why the 240 series which replaced the 140 had even more safety innovations in that department, like crumple zones, rear facing child seats and collapsible steering columns. Together with the smaller 340 models, they would make for most of the sales during the 70s and 80s for Volvo. The 90s brought with them a totally new model, the 850, a front-wheel drive, executive car which won numerous awards for handling and safety features. By now, productions costs were mounting up and Volvo was one of the few independent producers out there, after a proposed deal with Renault fell through in 1993. This forced the company to seek new marketing strategies and that's how the sleeker S40 and V40 models were introduced in the factory's production line. The new models brought a breath of fresh air, just like the C70 coupe and convertible, which are responsible for revitalizing the Volvo image while keeping in tune with the old tradition of safety and quality. The buyout of Volvo Cars was announced on January 28, 1998. Until then, Volvo Cars was owned by AB Volvo (the commercial vehicles group). In the following year acquisition for Volvo Cars by American car maker Ford Motor Co. was completed at a price of $6.45 billion USD. Volvo used the funds from the sale of the automobile division to finance the purchase of Scania, another leading Swedish truck manufacturer, but the deal was stopped for competition reasons by the European Union. Instead Volvo acquired the commercial vehicles division of French Renault and the American truck manufacturer Mack Trucks (which was owned by Renault at the time). As part of the arangement to buy Renault Trucks, the former parent company, Renault, bought in turn 20 percent in shares in AB Volvo. Among the reasons why Volvo took the initiative to sell the automobile manufacturing was the increasing development costs for new car models, coupled with the fact that it was a relatively small producer. The strategy was instead to grow as a truck manufacturer where it had a stronger market position. Volvo Automotive's motto is ""Volvo for life"" attributed to the reliability and safety of their cars. Volvo means ""I roll"" in Latin. Combined with their company symbol, (commonly mistaken for the male symbol) which actually stands for iron ore and according to the company, represents ""Rolling Strength"". Swedish brand founded on the guided principles of reliability, practicality and utterly cavernous estates. Now under the ownership of Chinese firm Geely, Volvo is on a hot streak recently, offering up handsome, safe, efficient cars with a subtly Scandinavian twist. Less thrusting than its German rivals.","Reliable, Safe, Practical, Efficient, Scandinavian, Cavernous, Handsome, Subtle,","Reliable, Safe, Practical, Efficient, Scandinavian, Cavernous, Handsome, Subtle,"
WIESMANN,"Wiesmann is the automotive dream company of two auto-passionate brothers from Germany, Martin Wiesmann and Friedhelm Wiesmann. Fascinated as children by motor-racing, the two brothers set out to build their own car. Their lasting and uncompromising idea was and remains to create a sporty car with classic elegant looks and highly-regarded balance. Their company's philosophy is to create a car that will ""stick to the road like geckos to a wall"", hence their brand logo, which represents a gecko. The company is fairly new to the automotive industry, but well built lavish vehicles earned them a place among the exclusive car manufacturers. Wiesmann started as a custom hard-top manufacturer for convertibles and is still in that business to this day. Their automotive history however, began in 1985 when during the Essen Motor Show the two brothers realised the sports cars exhibited there lacked one of the most important ingredients in their opinion: passion. So they embarked on a journey to create their own sports car with a fascinating old-fashioned shape, but with state-of-the-art technology. In 1986 their first development stage was complete and they now had a nearly finished chassis. Testings were under way and a year later they had their first Wiesmann roadster. In 1988 they have opened their first factory and made their debut presence as a car maker at that year's Essen Motor Show. In 1991 Wiesmann builds its factory in Telgenkamp, Dülmen and 2 years later the company exhibits its first car: the Wiesmann MF3 Roadster. The car had engine and transmission components sourced by BMW and due to the model’s immediate success on the German market, Wiesmann decided to continue its partnership with BMW to this day. During the IAA 2005 in Frankfurt, the purist sports car company released a new addition to their line-up, the GT MF4. In 2008 the two founding brothers decided the old headquarters at Telegenkamp in Dulmen should get a new upgrade in accordance with their company’s exclusivist philosophy. So they have build a futuristic architectural structure in the form of their existing facility which is made of steel and glass and resembles a gecko. The company calls it the “glass manufactory”. With business development going fairly well for the German car manufacturer, they have also considered entering the North American car market in 2010. Meanwhile, until the company prepares for that big step forward, the 100-employee factory is ready to unveil a new model at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show, the Wiesmann MF5 Roadster.

Xpeng,"Guangzhou Xiaopeng Motors Technology Co Ltd, or XPeng for short, was founded in 2014 by former senior executive Xia Heng and He Tao from one of the oldest Chinese automakers, GAC Group. Their connection to the automotive sector and financial companies such as Xiaomi or Alibaba helped the young car manufacturer gather the necessary funds to rocket onto the car market. The automaker launched its first prototype in 2016, an electric crossover. In the following year, it produced a test batch. After successful results, Xpeng proudly presented the series production for it, the G3. Unlike many other EVs produced that year, this one featured advanced driving assistance features (ADAS) that made customers storm the brand's showrooms in China. But the company's board wanted to play big, so the Algerian-born designer Rafik Ferrag was hired to lead the styling department. He worked previously for Citroen and Honda, and the first product he signed for the young Chinese brand was the P9 sedan, which was unveiled in 2019 at the Shanghai Auto Show. But the automaker's beginnings were not without bumps. Tesla and Apple sued Xpeng for IP theft. While in the former case, a jury had decided that it was not the case, the engineer accused of stealing secrets pleaded guilty in the latter case. Since the U.S. market looked very attractive, Xpeng opened a factory on American soil, and in 2018 it got permission from the California DMV to test autonomous vehicles. The company's rapid development made another Chinese giant Xiaomi invest $400 million in the automaker to help it evolve faster. In the same year, additional funding was gathered from Abu Dhabi's sovereign health fund Mubadala and Qatar's Investment Authority. Thus, in less than a decade since it was founded, Xpeng managed to introduce five models and a facelift for its first product, the G3. Another appealing market was the European one, where the automaker launched its P7 sedan in 2021. It was a bold move, but customers liked the car. Its safety features, futuristic look, and long range made it attractive. In addition, it was larger and more luxurious than other EVs on the market. Nevertheless, features like automatic parking in valet mode that didn't require a human presence in the vehicle, level 2 autonomous driving systems, and AI assistance were also present on the vehicle. Last but not least, the price was competitive. But Xpeng didn't limit itself to building cars and has developed an aero subsidiary that works to develop flying vehicles.

Zenvo,"Zenvo Automotive is a Danish supercar maker based in Praesto on the Danish island of Zealand. It was founded in 2004 by Troels Vollertsen, whose last name also inspired the name of the company (a combination of the first two and last three letters). The first prototype from the company was ready in December 2008 and went into production as the Zenvo ST1 in 2009. Only 15 units have been built and sold, saying a lot about the model’s exclusivity. Each unit was carefully hand built and features keyless entry, satellite navigation, adjustable steering wheel, and electrically adjustable leather racing seats. In 2017, Zenvo put out a new model to replace the ST1. It was named the TS1 and was looking almost identical to its predecessor, although with some aerodynamic enhancements. The suspension was also improved along with getting a new V8 engine. Brakes also got bigger while the interior got completely overhauled. As with its predecessors, only 15 TS1 were made, all being aimed towards export as the costs for registering such a car in Denmark costs more than €2,000,000.
